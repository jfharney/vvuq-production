This makes the cochlea vulnerable to blockade of cochlear blood flow and interruption of the oxygen supply. Although certain forms of human idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss reportedly arise from ischemic injury, the pathological mechanism of cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury has not been fully elucidated. Recent animal studies have shed light on the mechanisms of cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury. It will help in the understanding of the pathology of cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury to classify this injury into ischemic injury and reperfusion injury. Excitotoxicity, mainly observed during the ischemic period, aggravates the injury of primary auditory neurons.

INTRODUCTION The sole purpose of the circulatory system is transportation. It performs oxygen and nutrient delivery and metabolic by-product removal. The labyrinthine artery is a terminal artery for cochlear blood supply. The cochlea is highly dependent on blood and oxygen supply to maintain its function. In animal models of cochlear ischemia, the cochlea becomes hypoxic or ischemic within one minute after occlusion of the labyrinthine artery. It has been proposed that one of the major causes of human idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss is impaired blood flow and oxygen delivery to the cochlea [1]. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of recent insights regarding the pathogenesis of cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury observed in animal studies.CHANGES IN COCHLEAR POTENTIALS AND MORPHOLOGIES DURING ISCHEMIA Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a critical compound in cellular energy metabolism, is synthesized in mitochondria from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate in the presence of oxygen and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Interruption of the blood supply causes ATP depletion in the cochlea [2]. If this ATP depletion during ischemia is severe, it may lead to the compromised function of all cochlear cells. Perlman et al. [3] were the first to perform an extensive study of functional and histological alterations of the cochlea during and after reversible cochlear ischemia in the guinea pig. Because the stria vascularis requires high-level energy supply to maintain endocochlear potential (EP) levels, EP rapidly declines immediately after the onset of ischemia to reach its lowest level (-30 to -40 mV). EP is essential to maintain the function of hair cells and cochlear afferent neurons, and its decrease results in the subsequent decrease of other cochlear potentials, such as cochlear microphonic (CM), distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), and compound action potential (CAP) [4]. Generally, interruption of the blood supply causes various morphological changes including cellular, mitochondrial, and nuclear swelling, swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum, clearing of the cytoplasm, bleb formation, and the condensation of chromatin. However, the tolerance of cochlear cells to ischemia is variable among cell types. Dendrites of cochlear afferent neurons are one of the components most vulnerable to ischemia. The swelling of afferent neurons is observed in cases of cochlear ischemia of 5 minutes or longer. Ischemia-induced morphological changes are also observed in hair cells. Approximately 15 and 30 minutes of ischemia causes the swelling of outer and inner hair cells, respectively. As the ischemic period prolongs, more severe morphological changes are observed, such as the swelling of nuclei, bleb formation, and rupture of the cell membrane. Several hours of ischemia induces disintegration of the organ of Corti [4].EXCITOTOXICITY OF COCHLEAR AFFERENT NEURONS DURING THE ISCHEMIC PERIOD Excitotoxicity is an important and well-accepted theory proposed by Olney et al. [5], which explains one of the major pathophysiologies of brain ischemia. Excitotoxicity is caused by excessive amounts of glutamate in synaptic cleft. Glutamate is a putative excitatory neurotransmitter between inner hair cells and afferent neurons [6, 7]. Although vital for cochlear function, excessively released glutamate and the failure of its removal from synaptic clefts can lead to the excitotoxicity of cochlear afferent neurons due to the loss of ionic homeostasis. Puel et al. [8] showed that cochlear ischemia causes the excitotoxicity of afferent neurons to induce the massive swelling of afferent dendrites. The excessive efflux of glutamate from inner hair cells results in cochlear excitotoxicity. Massive glutamate efflux in the perilymph of the cochlea is observed during cochlear ischemia [9, 10]. Besides this excessive efflux, the failed uptake of glutamate from the synaptic clefts into surrounding cells also causes cochlear excitotoxicity. To date, five subtypes of Na+-dependent glutamate transporter: GLT-1, GLAST, EAAC1, EAAT4, and EAAT5, have been cloned [11-13]. Previous studies have demonstrated that GLAST is present in the supporting cells surrounding inner hair cells and in the satellite cells surrounding spiral ganglion neurons in the rodent cochlea [14, 15]. Takumi et al. [16] demonstrated the colocalization of GLAST and glutamine synthetase in supporting cells around inner hair cells. Based on their findings, it is suggested that glutamate released from the presynaptic region is taken into adjacent supporting cells using GLAST and then converted to glutamine in the supporting cells [17]. Glutamate transporters are required to terminate glutamate actions. Hakuba et al. [18] has shown that GLAST knockout mice are vulnerable to cochlear excitotoxicity. Although GLT-1 and EAAC1 also exist in the cochlea, the involvement of these glutamate transporters in cochlear exctitotoxicity has not yet been clarified. It is now widely accepted that glutamate receptors fall into two major classes: the ionotropic receptors formed by ligand-gated cation channels and the metabotropic receptors that are coupled to G-proteins and act though intracellular chemical mechanisms [19-21]. Eight subtypes of metabotropic glutamate receptors have been currently identified, and subdivided into three groups according to sequence homology and response to agonists [22]. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are divided into three types: AMPA, kainite, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The swelling of afferent dendrites is induced via non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors in the cochlea because the application of APMA and kainic acid to the cochlea leads to the same swelling of afferent dendrites. An AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, 6-7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), protected most of the radial dendrites from the ischemia-induced swelling [8]. In contrast to the involvement of AMPA/kainate receptors in the cochlear excitotoxicity and cochlear ischemic injury, a definitive role of metabotropic and NMDA receptors in cochlear ischemic injury has not been shown. MK-801 and D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate, NMDA receptor antagonists, did not show protective effects against cochlear ischemia [5, 23]. It is now considered that the excitotoxicity of cochlear afferent neurons often induces temporary hearing threshold shifts [24]. However, Sun et al. [25] demonstrated that some cochlear excitotoxicity might induce irreversible cochlear lesions because the number of cochlear ganglion neurons decreased after exposure to high concentration of kainic acid. The swelling of afferent neurons is observed in cases of cochlear ischemia of 5 minutes or longer. Excitotoxicity is undoubtedly one of the leading causes of cochlear afferent neuron injury during ischemia (Fig. 1). CHARACTERISTICS OF COCHLEAR INJURY DURING THE REPERFUSION PERIOD Although the cochlear response to ischemia has been extensively studied, the effects of reperfusion on the cochlea have recently received new attention. Recent animal models of cochlear ischemic injury are suitable to examine the time course of cochlear functions during reperfusion [9, 26-29]. The CAP threshold representing the function of cochlear afferent neurons gradually improved during the reperfusion period. On the other hand, DPOAE (representing the function of outer hair cells) initially recovered with time until 20 minutes after the onset of reperfusion when the cochlear circulation was restored. Thereafter the amplitude of DPOAE gradually decreased toward the noise level, whereas CAP gradually improved during this time period, as mentioned above. CM, another indicator of hair cell function, exhibited essentially the same time course during the reperfusion period as DPOAE [4]. Based on these findings, it is considered that the main lesion of cochlear reperfusion injury is in outer hair cells. In morphological studies of the cochlea, reperfusion of the cochlea induces swelling of the outer hair cells and eventual rupture of the outer hair cell membrane and nucleus [4]. The swelling of terminals of afferent dendrites improved during the reperfusion period [4]. This morphological finding is in agreement with the fact that CAP gradually improved whereas DPOAE decreased during reperfusion. Excitotoxicity during ischemia is involved in the swelling of afferent neurons, which improved during reperfusion. It has been shown that the glutamate concentration in the perilymph, which increased during the ischemic period, decreased toward the pre-ischemia level upon reperfusion [10].INVOLVEMENT OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES IN REPERFUSION INJURY OF THE COCHLEA As described in a previous section, outer hair cells functionally and structurally deteriorate during the early reperfusion period. Recent studies have indicated that free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals and nitric oxide (NO) are involved in the injury of outer hair cells. It has been generally accepted that reoxygenation causes the accumulation of superoxide anions in tissues. The superoxide anion is converted by superoxide dismutase to hydrogen peroxide, which is relatively unreactive toward most organic molecules. However, the hydroxyl radical, a potent oxidant capable of promoting oxidative damage, may be generated by the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with iron (Fenton reaction). Hydroxyl radicals can oxidize DNA, proteins, and structural polymers including hyaluronic acid. In addition, they induce the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid, which damages biological membranes [30]. Hypoxia increased the iron concentration in the perilymph of the cochlea [31], and the marked production of hydroxyl radicals was demonstrated during the re-oxygenation phase after hypoxia [32]. These findings suggest that hydroxyl radicals were generated via the Fenton reaction during the early reperfusion period in cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury. Generally, the main source of superoxide anions during reperfusion is considered to be mitochondria. Reduced intermediates of mitochondrial electron transport systems accumulate during ischemia and are oxidized during reperfusion (by reoxygenation), leading to the production of superoxide anions. Another potential source of superoxide anions is xanthine oxidase, which oxidizes hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to urate. However, xanthine oxidase may not be involved in the generation of free radicals because allopurinol and oxypurinol, potent inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, did not exhibit any effect on cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury [33]. Nitric oxide (NO) is also involved in the generation mechanism of cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury. Transient ischemia causes a marked increase of NO production in the perilymph in the reperfusion period [34]. To date, three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS) have been distinguished: neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). The constitutive isoforms of NOS (i.e., nNOS and eNOS), but not iNOS are expressed in the normal cochlea [35, 36]. Recent findings suggest that NO generated by nNOS and iNOS deteriorates the cochlea in ischemia-reperfusion injury [29, 37, 38]. NO synthesized by iNOS plays a deleterious role in cerebral ischemia, and ischemia-induced iNOS mRNA expression and iNOS activity were delayed by several hours (more than 6) after transient cerebral ischemia [39, 40]. The administration of aminoguanidine, an iNOS inhibitor, decreased the postischemic shift of the ABR or CAP threshold at 1 to 5 days after 60-minute ischemia, but not at 4 hours after ischemia [29, 38]. These results strongly suggest that NO generated by nNOS and by iNOS aggravates cochlear injury in early and late phases of reperfusion, respectively (Fig. 2). TIME THRESHOLD OF ISCHEMIA TO INDUCE COCHLEAR DYSFUNCTION Individual tissues have quite variable oxygen requirements. For example, the brain cannot tolerate hypoxia for more than a few minutes without permanent injury, although skeletal muscles can tolerate severe hypoxia or ischemia for several hours [41]. Several researchers have examined the time threshold of ischemia to induce cochlear dysfunction using animal models. EP and other cochlear potentials start to decrease within a minute after the cochlea is subjected to ischemia. When circulation is resumed, cochlear functions fully recover if the ischemic period is less than 10 minutes. However, DPOAE significantly decreases after ischemia of 10 minutes compared with the preischemic level [26]. CAP thresholds also elevate after ischemia of 10 minutes or longer [28]. These findings support the idea that ischemia of 10 minutes or longer at least transiently elevates the hearing threshold. When cochlear functions are followed for long periods after the onset of recirculation, ischemia of 15 to 30 minutes duration induces hair cell loss and permanent cochlear dysfunction [9, 29].PHARMACOLOGICAL STRATEGIES TO PROTECT THE COCHLEA AGAINST ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY This section presents a brief overview of experimental data concerning pharmacological strategies for cochlear protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury.1.Excitotoxicity An AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, 6-7-dinitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), protected most radial dendrites from ischemia-induced swelling [8]. In contrast to the protective effect of AMPA/kainate receptor inhibitors against cochlear excitotoxicity and cochlear ischemic injury, specific NMDA receptor antagonists including MK-801 and D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate did not show any protective effect against cochlear ischemia [8, 23]. There are several agents reported to reduce cochlear excitotoxicity including a GABA(A) agonist (muscimol [24]), dopamine [42, 43], riluzole [44], ebselen [45], and pituitary adenyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) [46]. Because the excitotoxicity of cochlear afferent neurons often induces temporary hearing threshold shifts [24], these agents are potential therapeutic targets to prevent temporary hearing deterioration. The majority of clinical trials of glutamatergic antagonists were conducted in the fields of stroke, traumatic brain injury and dementia. However, treatment with glutamatergic antagonists failed to obtain even modest beneficial results, and those clinical trials were interrupted [47]. In addition, the adverse effect profile of glutamatergic antagonists has been described. Based on the findings obtained in central nervous system disorders, it seems reasonable to consider local application of glutamatergic antagonists for prevention of temporary elevation of hearing thresholds.2.Free Radical Scavengers and NOS Inhibitors Seidman and Quirk [48] first demonstrated the involvement of free radicals in cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury. Since their report, several free radical scavengers have been reported to protect against cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury, including U74006F, mannitol, edaravone, and dimethylthiourea [4, 28, 48, 49]. It has been suggested that superoxide and hydrogen peroxide have a limited reactivity with most biological molecules in vivo, and their interaction in the presence of a transition metal (e.g., iron) forms far more reactive hydroxyl radicals by the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss (Fenton) reaction that contribute to tissue injury [30]. The protective effects of deferoxamine, an iron chelator, in cochlear ischemia have been established [38, 50]. In addition to free radical scavengers and iron chletors, NOS inhibitors protect the cochlea. N-nitro-L-arginine decreased the postischemic CAP threshold shift [28]. Inhibitors of nNOS (7-nitroindazole, 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole) and iNOS (aminoguanidine) also protect the cochlea against ischemia-reperfusion injury [29, 38, 50]. Outer hair cells deteriorate during reperfusion, and cochlear reperfusion injury is most evidently observed in outer hair cells. DPOAE studies demonstrated that free radical scavengers, iron chelators, and NOS inhibitors protected outer hair cells from reperfusion injury [4, 50].3.Adenosine Receptor Agonists Although information on the cochlea is limited, several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the protective effects of A1 adenosine receptor agonists in nervous tissues. It is thought that deleterious Ca2+ influx due to glutamate excitotoxicity is a primary target for neuroprotective adenosine actions in the central nervous system [51-53]. The excitotoxicity of cochlear afferent dendrites induced by kainic acid was attenuated by the application of 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA), a highly selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist. Ford et al. [54] reported the effects of the round window application of R-PIA, a selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist, on cochlear antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. R-PIA elicited significant increases in the activity of these antioxidant enzymes and significantly reduced the levels of malondialdehyde, a marker of lipid peroxidation, generated in the cochlea. Namely, it is possible that adenosine A1 receptor agonists protect the cochlea against ischemia-reperfusion injury by attenuating glutamate excitotoxicity and through a radical scavenging effect. Indeed, CCPA attenuated cochlear injury induced by transient ischemia [55].4.Growth Factors Several authors have shown that growth factors like insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and fibroblast growth factor may protect hair cells against damage triggered by ototoxic drugs or aging. These growth factors are important for the normal development and survival of cells including hair cells of the organ of Corti [56, 57]. Although the effects of growth factors on cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury have not been fully elucidated, the protective effects of erythropoietin and IGF-1 have been reported [58, 59].5.Steroids Glucocorticoids have been widely used in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss in humans. In a basic animal study, the cochlear function 4 hours after transient ischemia was significantly improved by glucocorticoids, prednisolone and methylprednisolone, at a relatively wide dose range in the case of pre-ischemic administration. On post-ischemic administration, higher doses of glucocorticoids were necessary to ameliorate cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury [54]. It is considered that glucocorticoids do not promote cochlear blood flow to protect hair cells [60, 61], but directly protect outer hair cells [62]. Dehydroepiandrosterone reportedly exhibits protective effects against cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury [63]. Interestingly, dehydroepiandrosterone also protects hair cells against acoustic injury [64], suggesting that this steroid protects hair cells and the cochlea against other forms of cochlear injury.CONCLUSION An understanding of the mechanisms of cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury is mandatory for the development of therapeutic interventions directed toward this type of injury. When organs are rendered ischemic, there is a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, which results in a decrease in cellular ATP. Excitotoxicity induced by glutamate efflux and its failed removal from extracellular spaces during ischemia aggravates the ischemic injury of primary auditory neurons. Outer hair cells are the most vulnerable to cochlear reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals and NO are leading factors in the reperfusion injury of outer hair cells. Once recirculation is achieved after ischemia, efforts are needed to prevent cochlear injury induced by reactive oxygen species and to minimize the loss of cochlear function. Many chemical agents including glutamate receptor antagonists, free radical scavengers and NOS inhibitors, adenosine receptor agonists, and growth factors are under investigation. Further research will clarify the details of the pathogenesis of cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injuries, and efforts should be made to establish strategies to protect the cochlea.

At present, the roles played by FDG-PET/CT in determination of margins for surgical resection of sarcoma are unclear. The present study was undertaken to explore the roles of FDG-PET/CT in determination of surgical margins for soft tissue sarcoma and to examine whether PET can serve as a standard means for setting the margins of surgical resection during reduced surgery. The study involved 7 patients with sarcoma who underwent surgery in our department and in whom evaluation with FDG-PET/CT was possible. Sarcoma was histologically rated as MFH in 6 cases and leiomyosarcoma in 1 case. In all cases, sarcoma was superficial (T1a or T2a). The tumor border was defined by contrast-enhanced MRI, and SUVs were measured at intervals of 1 cm over a 5-cm long area from the tumor border. Mapping of viable tumor cells was carried out on whole-mount sections of resected tissue, and SUVs were compared with histopathological findings. Preoperative maximum SUVs (SUV-max) of the tumor averaged 11.7 (range: 3.8-22.1). Mean SUV-max was 2.2 (range: 0.3-3.8) at 1 cm from the tumor border, 1.1 (0.85-1.47) at 2 cm, 0.83 (0.65-1.15) at 3 cm, 0.7 (0.42-0.95) at 4 cm, and 0.64 (0.45-0.82) at 5 cm. When resected tissue was mapped, tumor cells were absent in the areas where SUV-max was below 1.0. Our findings suggest that a safe surgical margin free of viable tumor cells can be ensured if the SUV cut-off level is set at 1.0. FDG-PET/CT is promising as a diagnostic imaging technique for setting of safe minimal margins for surgical resection of soft tissue sarcoma.

Our findings suggest that a safe surgical margin free of viable tumor cells can be ensured if the SUV cut-off level is set at 1.0. FDG-PET/CT is promising as a diagnostic imaging technique for setting of safe minimal margins for surgical resection of soft tissue sarcoma. Background In surgical treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, it is as a rule necessary to remove the tumor in a reliable fashion with surgical margins at which recurrence is unlikely. With this principle, Enneking et al. [1] proposed extensive resection based on the "compartment" concept. Later, Kawaguchi et al. [2] proposed curative extensive resection, adopting the concept of "barrier on the basis of tumor-resistant tissue." Guidelines for treatment of varying stages of soft tissue sarcoma such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines are available, and techniques for soft tissue sarcoma resection have been relatively well established. In the past, contrast-enhanced MRI was often used as a primary technique for determining surgical margins for soft tissue sarcoma. It is essential to perform general evaluation of the extent of tumor, responses to auxiliary therapy, and other factors preoperatively using multiple diagnostic imaging techniques. In the present study, we paid close attention to FDG-PET/CT, a tool for diagnostic imaging the use of which has spread rapidly in recent years. FDG-PET/CT has been shown to be useful in grading soft tissue sarcoma and evaluating responses to chemotherapy [3]. However, no report has been published concerning the effectiveness of FDG-PET/CT in determining surgical margins for soft tissue sarcoma. In the field of radiation therapy, the use of FDG-PET in combination with CT has been shown to enable efficient planning of treatment, since FDG-PET enables more accurate calculation of the actual extent of tumor than macroscopic evaluation of target tumor volume with CT or MRI [4,5]. This technique has been used effectively in clinical practice. The present study was undertaken to establish a new way of setting of surgical margins in the direction free of biological barrier tissue [2,6,7] by measurement of SUV at the tumor periphery.Methods The study involved 7 patients with subcutaneous soft tissue sarcoma who underwent treatment in our department between 2008 and 2009 and in whom evaluation by FDG-PET/CT was possible. They included 3 males and 4 females with a mean age of 70.4 years (range: 60-79). The tumor was histologically rated as MFH in 6 cases and leiomyosarcoma in 1 case (Table 1). For these cases, we determined tumor borders by using conventional contrast-enhanced MRI, and resection was planned to secure surgical margins between 3 and 5 cm from tumor borders determined by contrast-enhanced MRI. We selected 2 directions without biological barriers from among sagittal, axial, and coronal directions in tumor borders determined by preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI, and we measured SUV values of soft tissues that were indicated to be outside the tumor borders by contrast-enhanced MRI. SUV data by preoperative FDG-PET/CT were analyzed using VISIO KEOPSYS VIEWER (CODONICS: USA). In other words, we determined that the regions of interest (ROI) were at a distance of 5 cm and 1-cm interval from the tumor borders by contrast-enhanced MRI, and measured their SUV-max value (Figure 1). After extensive resection of the tumors, we performed mapping of neoplastic cells using whole area histological specimens of the resected tissues and compared with the preoperative SUV values (Figure 2).Table 1 Patient and tumour detailsSex/Age Histologic typeLocationSUV-maxFollow-up periodRecurrencePrognosisMale/70MFHThigh3.92y5M(-)DFMale/73MFHChest12.91y1M(-)AWDMale/60MFHShoulder10.51y1M(-)DFFemale/64MFHThigh3.82y3M(-)DFFemale/77MFHForearm13.82y2M(-)DFFemale/79MFHButtock14.91y(-)DFFemale/70Leiomyo SarcomaThigh22.12y1M(-)DF DF: disease free, AWD: alive with diseaseFigure 1 The Setting of Regions of interest (ROIs) from the tumor border.

Extensive resection of tumor was carried out with a margin of 3-5 cm from the tumor periphery. Mapping of viable tumor cells was carried out on whole sections of resected tissue (viable cells mapped in red color).Results Preoperative SUV-max of the tumor averaged 11.7 (range: 3.8-22.1). Mean SUV-max was 2.2 (range: 0.3-3.8) at 1 cm from the tumor border, 1.1 (0.85-1.47) at 2 cm, 0.83 (0.65-1.15) at 3 cm, 0.7 (0.42-0.95) at 4 cm, and 0.64 (0.45-0.82) at 5 cm (Table 2). When the resected tissue was mapped, the regions not more than 1.0 in SUV-max were free of tumor cells (tumor positive rate: 0%). The tumor positive rate was 25% for regions with SUV-max between 1.0 and 2.0 and 80% for those with SUV-max not less than 2.0 (Table 3). At present, 1Y to 2Y5M after the start of postoperative follow-up, all patients are alive without recurrence (Table 1).Table 2 Preoperative SUV valuesDistance from the tumor borderSUV-max (range)Tumor11.7 (3.8 ~ 22.1)0 ~ 1 cm2.2 (0.3 ~ 3.8)1 ~ 2 cm1.1 (0.85 ~ 1.47)2 ~ 3 cm0.83 (0.65 ~ 1.15)3 ~ 4 cm0.7 (0.42 ~ 0.95)4 ~ 5 cm0.64 (0.45 ~ 0.82)Table 3 The rates of viable tumor cellsSUV-maxTumor positive rate< 1.00%1.0 ~ 2.025%> 2.080%Discussion In 1980, Enneking et al. [1] proposed a technique of extensive resection by which dissection along the longitudinal direction of muscle is performed from origin to end and dissection along the transverse plane is performed in a compartment-wise fashion. Their technique, however, featured problems such as excessively wide resection and postoperative loss of function. In Japan, Kawaguchi et al. [2] proposed in 1982 a technique for curative extensive resection, adopting the concept of barrier based on tumor resistance of fascia, periosteum, cartilage tissue, and other tissues. Subsequently, data on surgical margins for a very large number of cases were analyzed to determine optimal methods of setting the surgical margins depending on tumor type, degree of histological malignancy, growth profile (invasive/noninvasive), recurrence, need for additional surgery, presence/absence of preoperative therapy, and other factors. On the basis of these analyses, extensive resection was defined as resection of the 1-4 cm area from the tumor-reactive layer and curative extensive resection as resection for 5 cm or more [6,7]. The guidelines published in 2010 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) proposed methods of treatment for varying stages of disease, and indicated that in case of Stage 1 tumor resection with a margin not less than 1 cm, the local rate of recurrence is low and close follow-up without active treatment suffices after resection while in case with an eventual margin less than 1 cm, addition of auxiliary radiotherapy is examined. In cases of Stage II/III tumor resection should as a rule be extensive (ensuring a margin of several centimeters free of tumor cells in all directions) and combined with preoperative/postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. As indicated above, extensive resection with a safe margin has been established. Furthermore, it has been reported that adjuvant chemotherapy significantly extends the length of time until local recurrence or distant metastasis of non-small round cell soft tissue sarcoma and significantly improves the 10-year disease-free survival rate [8]. Furthermore, outcome of treatment was improved by radiation, which contributed to preservation of affected limb function through tumor size reduction when performed preoperatively and through improvement of local control rate when performed postoperatively [9,10]. However, large tumors, those involving the nerves/blood vessels, tumors resistant to auxiliary therapy, and some other types of tumors still require sufficiently extensive resection, including normal tissue as well, accompanied by reconstruction-assisting surgery using flaps, vascular prostheses, and other techniques. These methods of treatment involve problems such as high cost, long time of surgery, and long hospital stay [11,12]. It is therefore desirable to explore the possibility of reducing surgical margins while observing the principle of ensuring radical treatment of tumor. Under these circumstances, we have recently begun to pay close attention to FDG-PET/CT, which has recently been reported to be useful in grading soft tissue sarcoma and evaluating responses to chemotherapy [3]. In the field of radiotherapy, the effectiveness of FDG-PET as a means of determining the area of irradiation for various types of cancer has been increasingly evaluated. When radiotherapy is planned, the area for irradiation, i.e., the target volume, is first decided. The target volume can be divided into gross tumor volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), internal target volume (ITV), and planning target volume (PTV). When the target volume is determined, assessment of lesion extent is most important, making use not only of visual inspection and palpation but also CT, MRI, FDG-PET, gastrointestinal radiography, and other imaging methods. Some investigators reported that more efficient treatment planning is possible with the use of FDG-PET in combination with CT, since FDG-PET enables more accurate calculation of the actual extent of tumor compared to GTV based on CT or MRI [4], while other investigators have reported that GTV could be significantly reduced with the use of FDG-PET compared to the use of CT scans [13], thus demonstrating the usefulness of FDG-PET. There is a report that because glucose consumption by tumor stroma may be reduced by aerobic metabolism, determination of the outline of the target cancer solely on the basis of FDG during radiotherapy planning may underestimate real tumor volume [14], indicating the need for adequate evaluation of the validity of FDG in treatment planning. Although FDG-PET/CT is a powerful means of diagnostic imaging the use of which has spread rapidly in recent years, its precise roles in setting of margins for surgical resection of sarcoma have yet to be clearly determined. In the present study, areas with SUV-max less than 1.0 were free of viable tumor cells. This finding suggests that safe surgical margins, ensuring the absence of viable tumor cells, may be selected if the cut-off SUV-max level is set at 1.0. Although the present study was confined to cases of subcutaneous soft tissue sarcoma, we plan to study the applicability of this technique to evaluation of sarcoma around major nerves, evaluation of bone invasion of sarcoma, and other types of tissue. A limitation of this study is that the number of cases is as small as 7. This is because the incidence of sarcoma is overwhelmingly low compared with that of cancer; therefore, it was difficult to design a large-scale study since our study was limited to subcutaneous sarcomas. In the present study, SUV-max can vary greatly among tumors of the same type. It is desirable to examine a larger number of cases to determine whether the cut-off SUV-max level can be uniformly set at 1.0 in all cases including those with tumor the center of which has a low SUV-max. Hence, at the present stage, our study results may be presented as a case report. In the future, we need to collect a variety of cases from multi-institutions as well as a single institution and further accumulate reliable data. Furthermore, in cases in which the body position during FDG-PET/CT differs from that during operation, the surgeon needs to take into account possible discrepancies between SUV data and actual tumor location. In recent years, FLT-PET using fluorothymidine (FLT) as a tracer has been performed to differentiate between inflammatory and tumor lesions. Thymidine is one of the elements present in the DNA, and its incorporation into cells is known as an indicator for cellular proliferation. FLT is an analog of thymidine. FLT is phosphorylated by a thymidine salvage pathway; however, it is not incorporated into nuclei. Malignant tumors show rapid cell proliferation and enhanced nucleic acid synthesis. Because the accumulation rate of FLT in inflammatory sites is considered to be lower than that of FDG, FLT might be more useful for determining the surgical margins of tumors.Conclusions Our findings suggest that a safe surgical margin free of viable tumor cells can be ensured if the SUV cut-off level is set at 1.0. FDG-PET/CT is promising as a diagnostic imaging technique for setting of safe minimal margins for surgical resection of soft tissue sarcoma.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributions MT, SN, TY and AT participated in the design of the study and performed the histological analysis.

Background Fuel ethanol is a renewable and environmentally friendly alternative energy source. Its large scale production has increased significantly over the last few years and is expected to grow even more given the need to reduce the world's dependence of oil [1-3]. Most of the current processes of bioethanol production are based on the use of very high gravity (VHG) fermentations in which highly concentrated media (sugar-cane molasses, starch or grains) are used as substrates [1,3]. The main advantage of VHG technology is the production of very high ethanol titres (usually above 15% v/v), decreasing the cost of the distillation step, which is considered one of the main constraints in the bioethanol industry [3]. In recent years, the interest in the production of bioethanol from alternative residues and, in particular, from agricultural lignocellulosic residues has gained strength. Besides being largely available, these residues do not compete with food resources and are therefore preferable for a sustainable large-scale production of bioethanol [4,5]. To make the lignocellulose present in agricultural residues available, raw materials have to be subjected to a pre-treatment and hydrolysis, during which mostly hemicellulose sugars are released. Under the extreme conditions observed in this pre-treatment step some of these sugars are converted into toxic inhibitors of microbial growth, such as furan derivatives (mostly furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural) and several phenolic compounds (for example, vanillin) [6,7]. Other inhibitory products include acetic acid, which derives from heavily acetylated polymers and is released during pre-treatment and hydrolysis. Acetic acid is frequently the most dominant inhibitor present in plant-biomass hydrolysates [8]. The current knowledge on the mechanisms underlying yeast tolerance to the toxicants present in lignocellulose hydrolysates fermentation, based on molecular studies and genome-wide approaches, was recently reviewed by Liu [9]. The success of lignocellulosic biomass and VHG fermentations is necessarily dependent on the ability of the used yeast strains to cope with the different stresses imposed during these processes. In biomass-based fermentations, yeast cells, besides having to tolerate the presence of the above-referred inhibitors, are also exposed to nutrient starvation and the absence of oxygen [8]. Moreover, the used yeast strains have to remain active under conditions that are near optimal for cellulase activity (pH 5, 40°C to 50°C) and/or secrete cellulase enzymes and co-utilize a variety of sugars at high yields [10]. In VHG fermentations, yeast cells are exposed to a high osmotic pressure in the beginning of the fermentative process, caused by the high sugar concentrations present at that time. Other relevant stresses in VHG fermentations include depletion of some nutrients, a lack of oxygen and an accumulation in the growth medium of high concentrations of ethanol that, together with the elevated levels of other toxic fermentation by-products, become lethal for the fermenting yeast cells [11-14]. The development of yeast strains innately more tolerant to stresses relevant for VHG and/or for biomass fermentations will improve the performance of these processes and contribute to the development of the bioethanol industry. In this work an integrated approach was undertaken, with the aim of identifying genes required for simultaneous yeast resistance to a high number of fermentation-related stresses. The yeast genes described in large-scale phenotypic analysis as being required for maximal yeast tolerance to ethanol [15], high glucose concentrations (as those found in industrial growth media) [16], acetic acid [17], vanillin [18] and furfural [19] were compared. A set of genes conferring resistance to high concentrations of glucose, acetic acid and ethanol, stresses relevant for VHG fermentations; and to ethanol, acetic acid, furfural and/or vanillin were identified. Comparative fermentative performance analysis under industrially relevant conditions allowed the narrowing down of the number of genes whose expression is required for the maximum performance of VHG fermentations or for the fermentation of wheat straw hydrolysates (WHSs). This therefore revealed suitable candidates for subsequent genetic engineering, with the aim to obtain more robust industrial yeast strains.ResultsIdentification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes involved in tolerance to relevant stresses in VHG alcoholic fermentations or in biomass-based fermentations To identify yeast genes that simultaneously confer resistance to inhibitory concentrations of ethanol, glucose and acetic acid or to acetic acid, ethanol, vanillin and/or furfural, we used the results of genome-wide phenotypic screenings carried out in the presence of those stressors [15-19]. Other datasets of determinants of resistance to ethanol and acetic acid were available in the literature [20-23]. However, these studies were not performed using the BY4741 strain, which was the one used to screen the determinants of tolerance to furfural, vanillin and high glucose concentrations [16,18,19], and therefore they were not considered because the genetic background of the yeast strain used is known to have a high impact on the results obtained in large-scale phenotype screenings. Eight genes conferring resistance to ethanol, glucose and acetic acid were identified: Anp1, Bud31, Hpr1, Pho85, Ppa1, Vrp1, Rpl1B and Ygl024w (Figure 1A). The physiological function of these genes is described in Table 1. No gene providing protection towards acetic acid, ethanol, furfural and vanillin was found. However, six genes common to the dataset of determinants of resistance to acetic acid, vanillin and ethanol (End3, Erg2, Erg24, Gcs1, Rav1 and Tps1) and five to the dataset of genes required for tolerance to ethanol, acetic acid and furfural (Nat3, Ppa1, Prs3, Rpb4 and Vma8) were identified (Figure 1B; Table 1).Figure 1 Comparison of the yeast genes described as determinants of resistance to inhibitory concentrations of (A) ethanol, glucose and acetic acid or of (B) ethanol, acetic acid and furfural or vanillin. The genes in the intersection of these datasets are highlighted. This comparative analysis was based on published genome-wide phenotypic screenings carried out in the presence of the referred stressors [15-19].Table 1 Physiological function of genes shown in Figure 1 as being required for tolerance to inhibitory concentrations of glucose, ethanol and acetic acid or ethanol, acetic acid and vanillin or furfural.GeneFunctionaStress: Ethanol, acetic acid and glucoseAnp1Subunit of the α-1, 6 mannosyltransferase complex involved in the mannysolation of cell wall proteinsBud31Protein involved in mRNA splicingHpr1Subunit of THO/TREX complexes that couple transcription elongation with mitotic recombination and with mRNA metabolism and exportPho85Cyclin-dependent kinase involved in the regulation of yeast response to nutrient depletion, environmental stress and cell cycle progression.Ppa1Proteolipid subunit of the membrane domain of the vacuolar H*-ATPase (V-ATPase)Rpl1BComponent of the large (60S) ribosomal subunitVrp1Actin-associated protein involved in cytoskeletal organization and cytokinesisYgl024wUnknown FunctionStress: Ethanol, acetic acid and vanillinEnd3Protein involved in endocytosis, actin cytoskeletal organization and cell wall morphogenesisErg2Sterol isomerase involved in ergosterol biosynthesisErg24Sterol reductase involved in ergosterol biosynthesisGcs1ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase activating protein, involved in transport from endoplasmic reticulum to GolgiRav1Subunit of the RAVE complex which promotes assembly of the V-ATPaseTps1Synthase subunit of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase complex required for trehalose biosynthesisStress: Ethanol, acetic acid and furfuralNat3Catalytic subunit of the NATB N-terminal acetyltransferase involved in protein acetylationPpa1Proteolipid subunit of the membrane domain of the vacuolar H*-ATPase (V*ATPase)Rpb4RNA polymerase II subunitPrs3Pyrophosphate synthetase required for nucleotide, histidine and tryptophan biosynthesisVma8Peripheral membrane domain subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) aThe description of gene function is based on the information available in the Saccharomyces Genome Database www.yeastgenome.org. NATB: RAVE: regulator of the ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes.Role of genes providing protection against acetic acid, ethanol and glucose stresses in VHG fermentations The role in VHG fermentations of the eight genes required for yeast tolerance to inhibitory concentrations of glucose, acetic acid and ethanol (Anp1, Bud31, Hpr1, Pho85, Ppa1, Rpl1B, Vrp1 and Ygl024w; Figure 1A) was examined. For this, the fermentation rate and the final concentration of ethanol produced were compared in cells of the parental strain BY4741 and in deletion mutants lacking the above referred genes. The fermentation rate was assessed based on the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced at mid-fermentation (49 h). The elimination of the genes under analysis in a non-stressful fermentation carried out in standard yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) growth medium (with 2% glucose) did not significantly affect the final ethanol production (no significant differences at 95% confidence level; results not shown). The results obtained in the growth medium optimized for VHG fermentations are summarized in Table 2 and in Figure 2A. Under the oxygen-limiting conditions used in these fermentations, which resemble the typical anaerobic conditions found in large-scale VHG fermentations, the profile of CO2 production obtained in wild-type cells and in the different mutants tested was similar to the profile of ethanol formation, which indicates that most of the CO2 produced came from the fermentative pathway (results not shown). Taking this into consideration, the profile of CO2 production of the wild-type and of the selected deletion mutants is shown in Figure 2B, as it provides a suitable assessment of how the fermentation proceeded in these different strains.Table 2 Effect of the expression of the Anp1, Bud31, Hpr1, Pho85, Ppa1, Rpl1B, Vrp1 and Ygl024w genes, required for tolerance to inhibitory concentrations of glucose, acetic acid and ethanol, in VHG fermentation.Strain[Ethanol] (g/L)ΔEthanol (compared to wild-type cells)[CO2] at mid-fermentation (g/L)ΔCO2 (compared to wild-type cells)BY4741136 ± 2072 ± 50Δanp1122 ± 1-11 ± 1**67 ± 10 ± 4Δbud3170 ± 1-49 ± 1**14 ± 0-54 ± 3**Δhpr175 ± 1-45 ± 1**28 ± 0-41 ± 3**Δpho85108 ± 0-21 ± 1**57 ± 5-12 ± 6*Δrpl1b132 ± 5-3 ± 366 ± 1-1 ± 4Δvrp1117 ± 2-13 ± 2**64 ± 1-16 ± 2**Δvgl024w126 ± 1-8 ± 1**55 ± 1-18 ± 3**Δppa1127 ± 1-7 ± 1**84 ± 125 ± 3** The comparison of the fermentation profile of wild-type cells and of the deletion mutants was based on the concentration of ethanol produced at the end of the fermentation ([Ethanol] and ΔEthanol) and on the amount of CO2 formed ([CO2] and ΔCO2) at mid-fermentation point (49 h - time taken by the parental strain to reach 50% of the total CO2 produced), as described in Methods. The results shown are means of at least two independent experiments and the statistical significance of the results obtained was quantified using a t-test (n = 2). *P <0.05; **P < 0.01.Figure 2 (A) Comparison between the concentration of CO2 (Δ[CO2]corr) at mid fermentation point (49 h) and of the final amount of ethanol (Δ[Ethanol]corr) produced by cells of the parental strain S. cerevisae BY4741 and by mutants deleted for the Anp1, Bud31, Hpr1, Pho85, Ppa1, Rpl1B, Vrp1 and Ygl024w genes during fermentation of a growth medium optimized for VHG technology. The Δ[CO2]corr and Δ[Ethanol]corr parameters were calculated using equations 3 and 4, which are detailed in Methods. (B) The profile of CO2 production by wild-type cells or by the selected deletion mutants (all mentioned above except for Δrpl1b mutant). Those deletion mutants found to start the fermentation at the same time as wild-type cells (shown on left) were separated from those which started the fermentation later (shown on right). Error bars represent the range between independent biological duplicates. Parental strain cells produced approximately 136 g/L ethanol (Table 2) from the 304 g/L of glucose that were initially provided in the growth medium, corresponding to an ethanol conversion yield of 87%. Out of the mutants tested only Δrpl1b fermented at a similar rate and produced the same levels of ethanol as wild-type cells (Table 2), leading us to conclude that the Rpl1B gene should be dispensable for maximal performance of VHG fermentations. All the other deletion mutants tested produced lower levels of ethanol and/or exhibited reduced fermentation rates (Table 2 and Figure 2A). The highest reduction was observed for Δhpr1 and Δbud31 mutant strains (Table 2, Figure 2A), which produced less than half the amount of ethanol produced by the parental strain. The analysis of the corresponding CO2 production profiles showed that fermentation by these mutant cells started significantly later than wild-type cells, which resumed fermentation almost immediately after inoculation (Figure 2B). This observation is consistent with the reported involvement of Bud31 and Hpr1 in yeast tolerance to inhibitory concentrations of glucose [16]. The fermentation of Δhpr1 and of Δbud31 cells stopped prematurely, leaving almost 130 g/L of glucose in the growth medium (Figure 2B). The analysis of the results obtained for the other deletion mutants indicates that the elimination of Anp1, Pho85, Ppa1, Vrp1 or Ygl024w genes does not significantly affect the immediate resumption of fermentation after inoculation. Even so, a significant reduction of the fermentation rate is observed for Δpho85, Δvrp1 and Δygl024w mutants while an increase is observed for the Δppa1 mutant. The elimination of Anp1 does not affect the fermentation rate but the final ethanol concentration is diminished (Table 2).Role of the expression of yeast genes providing resistance to ethanol, acetic acid, furfural or vanillin in the growth and fermentation of a wheat straw hydrolysate A WSH was prepared following the methodology described by Ruiz et al. [24]. Under the used conditions the composition of the solid fraction was 37% glucan, 33% xylan and 27% lignin and the hemicellulosic fraction of the hydrolysate had 1.90 g/L glucose, 15.40 g/L xylose, 2.09 g/L arabinose (both monomeric and oligomeric forms), 1.50 g/L acetic acid, 0.34 g/L formic acid, 0.57 g/L furfural, 0.10 g/L hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and a residual concentration of vanillin (below 0.01 g/L). The hydrolysate was supplemented to a final glucose concentration of 50 g/L. The concentrations of the different inhibitors produced in the WSH prepared are consistent with those reported in other studies [4]. From the set of 11 genes providing resistance to ethanol, acetic acid and furfural or vanillin, indicated in Figure 1B, only Erg2, Prs3, Rpb4 and Vma8 were required for yeast growth in WSH (Table 3 and Figure S1 in Additional file 1). Consistent with the idea that these genes play no role in yeast growth in the absence of stress, no significant differences in the growth of these deletion mutants and of parental strain cells in YPD growth medium were observed (Figure S1 in Additional file 1). In agreement with the requirement of Erg2, Prs3, Rpb4 and Vma8 for growth in the WSH, based on their protective effect against the inhibitors present therein, Δerg2, Δprs3, Δrpb4 and Δvma8 mutants were also unable to grow in a minimal growth medium (MM4) supplemented with the same concentration of inhibitors found in the hydrolysate (Table 3 and Figure S1 in Additional file 1).Table 3 Comparison, by spot assays, of growth of S. cerevisiae BY4741 cells and of the 11 deletion mutants that lack the genes found to provide resistance against ethanol, acetic acid and furfural or vanillin.Strain/mediumWSHaMM4 + inhibitorsbBY4741++++Δprs3+-Δrav1++++Δppa1++++Δend3++++Δerg24++++Δerg2+-Δnat3++++Δvma8++Δgcs1++++Δrpb4++Δtps1++++ Cells used to prepare the spots were cultivated in YPD liquid medium until mid-exponential phase (OD600 nm = 1.5 ± 0.2) and then applied as spots (4 μL) into the surface of the agar plates containing different growth media.

The fermentation profile of wild-type S. cerevisiae BY4741 cells in the hydrolysate prepared from wheat straw was compared with that of the Δend3, Δerg2, Δerg24, Δgcs1, Δnat3, Δppa1, Δprs3, Δrav1, Δrpb4, Δtps1 and Δvma8 mutants and the results obtained are summarized in Table 4 and in Figures 3 and 4. The parental strain consumed the 50 g/L of glucose provided in the hydrolysate producing approximately 21 g/L of ethanol (Table 4). Out of the deletion mutants tested, Δrpb4 and Δvma8 were those generating the lowest ethanol concentrations (3 g/L and 7 g/L, respectively), exhibiting also the lowest fermentation rates (Figures 3 and 4A). Consistently, these two mutants were among those whose growth in the hydrolysate was more affected (Table 3 and Figure S1 in Additional file 1). Δerg2 and Δprs3 cells, which were also found to have impaired growth in the hydrolysate (Table 3 and Figure S1 in Additional file 1), did not produce significantly lower ethanol levels compared to wild-type cells (Table 4), but their fermentation rate was found to be much lower (Figures 3 and 4B). This fact may be due to the protective effect that these genes exert against the ethanol that is being accumulated and which is not initially present in the hydrolysate. Despite this, these mutants produced the same levels of ethanol as wild-type cells (Table 4). The Δrav1 mutant, which had not shown impaired growth in the presence of hydrolysate inhibitors (Table 3 and Figure S1 in Additional file 1) and presented the same final ethanol concentration as the wild type strain (Table 4), exhibited a significant decrease in the fermentation rate (Table 4). Interestingly, the fermentation of Δppa1 cells occurred faster than that carried out by wild-type cells, as had also been observed in the fermentation of the VHG-optimized growth medium (Figures 2B and 4B). However, in contrast to what was observed in the VHG-optimized growth medium, in which a slight reduction in final ethanol production was observed in Δppa1 cells, these mutant cells produced the same amount of ethanol from the WSH as wild-type cells (Table 4 and Figure 3).Table 4 Effect of the expression of genes required for tolerance to inhibitory concentrations of ethanol, acetic acid and furfural or vanillin in the fermentation of a wheat straw hydrolysate.Strain[Ethanol] (g/L)ΔEthanol (compared to wild-type cells)[CO2] at mid-fermentation (g/L)ΔCO2 (compared to wild-type cells)BY474121 ± 208 ± 10Stress: Acetic acid, ethanol and furfuralΔnat322 ± 01 ± 28 ± 17 ± 11Δppa121 ± 01 ± 012 ± 044 ± 8 **Δprs320 ± 0-5 ± 13 ± 1-50 ± 9 **Δrpb43 ± 0-85 ± 2 **0 ± 0-78 ± 11 **Δvma87 ± 1-63 ± 5 **0 ± 1-80 ± 11 **Stress: Acetic acid, ethanol and vanillinΔend321 ± 0-1 ± 25 ± 2-33 ± 20Δerg220 ± 1-5 ± 32 ± 0-256 ± 68 **Δerg2421 ± 0-1 ± 08 ± 1-5 ± 10Δgcs122 ± 02 ± 15 ± 1-43 ± 13 *Δrav121 ± 0-1 ± 14 ± 0-43 ± 8 **Δtps121 ± 0-3 ± 15 ± 1-32 18 The comparison of the fermentation profile of wild-type cells and of the deletion mutants was based on the concentration of ethanol produced at the end of the fermentation and on the amount of CO2 formed at mid-fermentation point (14 h - time taken by the parental strain to reach 50% of the total CO2 produced), as described in Methods.

Error bars represent the error propagation associated with arithmetic operations used to determine the global relative variation of each mutant strain.Figure 4 Profile of CO2 production by wild-type cells or by the mutants deleted for genes providing resistance against ethanol, acetic acid and vanillin or furfural. Those deletion mutants found to produce much lower levels of CO2 than those achieved by cells of the parental strain (panel A) were separated from those producing lower, but more similar concentrations (panel B). Error bars represent the range between independent biological duplicates.Discussion In this study, a set of S. cerevisiae genes involved in tolerance to relevant stresses in lignocellulosic biomass- or VHG- based fermentations was identified and the requirement of some of these genes for maximal fermentation performance was demonstrated for the first time. Specifically, the effect of genes involved in tolerance to acetic acid, glucose, ethanol, furfural and vanillin was addressed. The results emerging from chemogenomic screenings have the potential to identify genes that could be interesting targets for subsequent genetic engineering aiming to obtain more robust industrial yeast strains. However, the datasets often reach hundreds of genes, which makes the identification of the best candidates difficult. Furthermore, genes found to be specifically required to confer resistance to individual stresses may not be interesting in a multi-stress environment. In this context, the strategy followed in this study to search for cross-resistance genes provided a straightforward and focused approach. Furthermore, this is a much more realistic approach to the problem since it is clear that it is the combined effect of the different fermentation stressors that poses the greatest challenge to the success of industrial fermentations [8,25-27]. Moreover, as reported by Marks et al. [28], studies performed under standard laboratory conditions are inadequate for revealing the mechanisms of metabolic and regulatory changes that occur during industrial fermentation processes. The impact of the combination of relevant stresses that occurs during these fermentations is likely to be more complex, since the yeast cells are subjected to wide variations in diverse environmental factors. It would be interesting to find genes that were able to simultaneously increase yeast tolerance to all the stresses considered in the current study, given the fact that future lignocellulosic hydrolysate formulations will require higher initial sugar concentrations to assure the production of higher bioethanol titers. Since such a gene could not be identified, subgroups of genes were considered separately in the context of lignocellulosic biomass- or VHG- based fermentations. Out of the eight genes found to contribute simultaneously for yeast tolerance to inhibitory concentrations of glucose, acetic acid and ethanol [15-17], five were demonstrated to be required for maximal fermentation performance in a growth medium optimized for VHG fermentations: Bud31 and Hpr1, which were found to have a crucial effect in both ethanol yield and fermentation rate; and Pho85, Vrp1 and Ygl024w, which were required for a maximal ethanol production. Bud31 and Hpr1 encode two proteins involved in general transcription activities; Bud31 is required for splicing and associates with yeast spliceossome factors and Hpr1 is involved in transcription elongation and mRNA metabolism and export. Significantly, a previous study has successfully engineered the basal yeast transcription machinery to create a strain with increased tolerance to inhibitory concentrations of ethanol and glucose. This strain will, therefore, also have an increased fermentative capacity on sugar-enriched substrates [29]. Interestingly, none of the referred eight genes was among the set of genes whose transcription was reported to be altered in an industrial bioethanol process [30]. Furthermore, the products of these genes were also not found among the proteins whose content was altered during VHG fermentation [31]. Frequently the transcription of a gene that is required for resistance to a given stress is not responsive to that same stress [11,14,32]. This causes gene expression to be a poor predictor of genes important for resistance to fermentation stressors and highlights the usefulness of a chemogenomic analysis that directly addresses the effect of the expression of a given gene in resistance. Moreover, our approach, of identifying key genes common to different relevant stresses in bioethanol fermentations and validating the identified genes under fermentation conditions close to the industrial ones, overcomes some of the constraints of conventional chemogenomic approaches based on laboratory media. Previous analyses leading to the identification of yeast genes conferring increased resistance to lignocellulose hydrolysis-derived phenolic inhibitors focused mostly on genes related to the specific detoxification of these compounds through their enzymatic conversion into less toxic compounds (reviewed in Liu [9]). Since our focus was the identification of genes whose expression confers simultaneous resistance to these inhibitors, and also to acetic acid and ethanol, it was to be expected that those genes previously found to play very specific roles in yeast resistance to each of these chemical stress inducers would not be present in our dataset. We believe that this integrated approach has the potential to guide the selection of the genes that contribute to the overall viability and fermentative capacity of yeast cells under multiple stress conditions. Among the genes providing resistance to ethanol, acetic acid and vanillin or furfural, Erg2, Prs3, Rpb4 and Vma8 were found, for the first time, to contribute to maximal yeast cell growth and fermentation rate in WSH, while Rav1 contributed only to reaching maximal fermentation rate. Rav1 and Vma8 are both involved in the assembly and function of the vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase (V-ATPase): Rav1 is a subunit of the RAVE complex (Regulator of the ATPase of Vacuolar and Endosomal membranes) which promotes assembly of V-ATPase holoenzyme [33], and Vma8 encodes the subunit D of the V1 peripheral membrane domain of the enzyme. V-ATPase plays a crucial role in the maintenance of internal pH within physiological values, especially under conditions of stress that induce intracellular acidification, as is the case of acetic acid and ethanol stress [15,34]. Consequently, V-ATPase was identified as a crucial determinant of resistance to these two chemicals [15,17]. Erg2 encodes one of the key enzymes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. A decrease in the transcript levels of ergosterol biosynthetic genes was reported previously to occur during bioethanol [30] and winemaking [35] processes, possibly as a response to the lack of oxygen. The activation of ergosterol biosynthesis seems to be one of the reasons why the frequent addition of oxygen is used to increase yeast viability and fermentation quality in the winemaking processes. Several studies have correlated ergosterol (the major sterol in the plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae) with yeast tolerance to stress, particularly against ethanol [36,37], indicating a prominent role of this lipid in stabilizing membrane lipids and proteins against the detrimental effects of ethanol. Remarkably, it was recently demonstrated that V-ATPase activity is reduced in mutants devoid of Erg2 expression [38]. The Erg24 gene, encoding a C-14 sterol reductase also involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, was also identified as a common determinant of resistance to ethanol, acetic acid, vanillin and furfural; however, the expression of this gene was dispensable for yeast growth in the WSH and only had a slight effect on the fermentation performance of this substrate. This may be due to the fact that the deletion of Erg2 and Erg24 lead to the accumulation of different sterols in the yeast plasma membrane.Conclusions With this study, we successfully narrowed down the number of genes previously identified through genome-wide screenings whose genetic manipulation is promising in the context of bioethanol process optimization. The focused and more realistic approach exploited in this study allowed us to confirm the practical importance of a set of genes for maximal fermentation performance in a growth medium optimized for VHG and/or lignocellulosic biomass industrial fermentations. These results expand our understanding of the genes and underlying molecular mechanisms that are directly involved in yeast tolerance and response to the multiple stresses occurring during bioethanol fermentations under industrially relevant conditions. The use of genetic engineering approaches to increase the expression of the selected genes in industrial strains is the next logical step, to find out whether these manipulations may lead to the generation of more robust industrial yeast strains, able to cope with the most significant fermentation stresses and, thus, to increase ethanol production rate and final ethanol titers.MethodsStrains and growth media The parental strain S. cerevisiae BY4741 (MATa, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0 and ura3Δ0) and the 18 derived deletion mutant strains used in this study (Δanp1, Δbud31, Δend3, Δerg2, Δerg24, Δgcs1, Δhpr1, Δnat3, Δpho85, Δppa1, Δprs3, Δvrp1, Δrav1, Δrpb4, Δrpl1b, Δtps1, Δvma8 and Δygl024w) were acquired from the EUROSCARF collection. VHG fermentations were carried out in a growth medium that contains, per liter: 304 g glucose, 44.3 g corn steep liquor (CSL), 2.3 g urea, 3.8 g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O) and 0.03 g copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O). The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.5 using 1 M sodium hydroxide. CSL was kindly provided by a starch manufacturer (COPAM, Lisbon, Portugal) and its manipulation in the laboratory as well as its detailed composition have been previously described by Pereira et al. [39]. Control fermentations were performed in YPD growth medium that contains 2% (w/v) glucose, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone and 1% (w/v) yeast extract. The MM4 growth medium used to test the susceptibility of yeast cells to the inhibitors found in WHSs contained, per liter, 20 g glucose, 2.65 g ammonium sulfate, 1.7 g yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 20 mg methionine, 20 mg histidine, 60 mg leucine and 20 mg uracil. Solid YPD and MM4 growth media were obtained by supplementing the liquid medium with 2% (w/v) agar.Preparation of the WSH A lignocellulosic WSH was prepared following the method described by Ruiz et al. [24]. Briefly, the milled wheat straw (with particle size distribution of: > 1 mm, 10%; between 1 mm and 0.5 mm, 40%; between 0.5 mm and 0.3 mm, 40%; < 0.3 mm, 10%) and water were mixed in order to obtain a ratio 10:1 liquid/solid and treated for 30 min in a 3.75 L stainless steel reactor, at 180°C. After hydrolysis, the liquid phase (hemicellulosic liquor) was collected by filtration and stored at -20°C. Prior to its use for fermentation, the hemicellulosic liquor was centrifuged for 10 min at 4800 g (4°C) to remove the solid fraction and then sterilized by filtration. The liquid phase of the hemicellulosic liquor was supplemented with glucose (up to a final concentration of 50 g/L) to improve the ethanol yields and with 240 mg/L leucine, 80 mg/L histidine, 80 mg/L methionine and 80 mg/L uracil to account for the auxotrophies of the BY4741 strain. The pH of this liquid fraction was finally adjusted to 5.5 with 10 M sodium hydroxide. The concentrations of glucose, xylose, arabinose, acetic acid, formic acid, furfural, vanillin and HMF in the WSH prepared, as described above, were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Glucose, xylose, acetic acid and formic acid were quantified upon separation of an aliquot of the hydrolysate in a Varian MetaCarb 87H column, eluted at 60°C with 0.005 M sulfuric acid, at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. The peaks corresponding to glucose, xylose and arabinose were detected using a refractive index detector, whereas acetic acid and formic acid were detected using an UV detector set at 210 nm. Furfural, vanillin and HMF were quantified upon separation of an aliquot of the hydrolysate in a Macherey-nagel C18 column, eluted with 20% acetonitrile to 80% water at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min. Peak detection was performed using an UV detector set at 276 nm.Fermentations in VHG-optimized medium or in WSH Cells used to inoculate the optimized VHG-growth medium or the WSH were cultivated at 30°C for 24 h, with orbital agitation (150 rpm), in YPD growth medium (supplemented with 240 mg/L leucine, 80 mg/L histidine, 80 mg/L methionine and 80 mg/L uracil). After that, cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 4800 g, 4°C) and the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride to obtain 200 mg/mL fresh yeast. This concentrated cell suspension was used to inoculate 35 mL of the VHG-optimized growth medium or the WSH, with a cellular concentration of 1 × 108 cells/mL. Fermentations were carried out in 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks fitted with perforated rubber stoppers enclosing glycerol-filled air-locks (to permit CO2 exhaustion while avoiding the entrance of air). Prior to inoculation, both media were aerated by stirring with a magnetic bar (length 3 cm) at > 850 rpm for 20 min. Under these conditions the oxygen concentration in the growth media was higher than 95% of air saturation. The fermentation was followed by measuring the reduction of mass loss resulting from CO2 production. At each time point, the standard deviation between replicates was less than 2% of the average value for the CO2 production. The concentrations of glucose, glycerol and ethanol in the growth media throughout the fermentations were quantified by HPLC. For this, an aliquot of the culture supernatant was separated on a Varian MetaCarb 87H column and eluted at 60°C with 0.005 M sulfuric acid at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Peak detection was performed using a refractive-index detector.Comparative analysis of the fermentation profile of VHG-optimized growth medium or WSH by wild-type S. cerevisae BY4741 cells and selected deletion mutants The fermentation profile in VHG-optimized medium or in the WSH of the parental strain BY4741 was compared with that of selected deletion mutants based on two kinetic parameters; the concentration of ethanol present at the end of the fermentation and the amount of CO2 produced at mid-fermentation point, that is, the time at which the amount of CO2 produced by wild-type cells achieved half of the total produced. For each deletion mutant these two fermentation parameters were compared with those of the parental strain using equations 1 and 2: (1)ΔEthanolVHG or WSH=Ethanolmutantstrain-Ethanolwild-typeEthanolwild-type (2)ΔCO2VHG or WSH=CO2mutantstrain-CO2wild-typeCO2wild-type To take into account that the elimination of a gene may affect the fermentation performance even in the absence of stress, the fermentation profile of the parental strain BY4741 and of the 18 deletion mutants used in this study was compared in standard YPD growth and the values of Δ[Ethanol]VHG or WSH and Δ[CO2]VHG or WSH were corrected using equations 3 and 4: (3)ΔEthanolcorr=ΔEthanolVHG or WSH1-ΔEthanolYPD (4)ΔCO2corr=ΔCO2VHG or WSH1-ΔCO2YPD A t-test (one-way ANOVA) was used to assess the statistical significance of the results.Comparative analysis of the growth of wild-type cells and of the selected deletion mutants in WSH using spot assays Growth of wild-type BY4741 cells in the WSH was compared with that of the deletion mutants Δend3, Δerg2, Δerg24, Δgcs1, Δnat3, Δppa1, Δprs3, Δrpb4, Δvma8, Δrav1 and Δtps1 using spot assays. For this, cells were cultivated at 30°C with orbital agitation (150 rpm) in YPD liquid medium until mid-exponential phase (OD600 of 1.5 ± 0.2) and then diluted to obtain a cell suspension with a standardized OD600 nm of 0.1 ± 0.02. Four microliters of this cellular suspension were applied as spots onto the surface of plates containing the WSH supplemented with 2% agar. The susceptibility of wild-type cells and of the deletion mutants was also compared in MM4 growth medium supplemented or not with the same mixture of inhibitors found in the WSH, that is 1.5 g/L acetic acid, 0.34 g/L formic acid, 0.57 g/L furfural and 0.1 g/L HMF. The pH of the MM4 growth medium was adjusted to pH 5.5 with sodium hydroxide prior to autoclaving. The cell suspensions used to inoculate the MM4 growth media plates were obtained as described above.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributions FP participated in the design of experiments, collected the data and drafted the manuscript.

STAT3 is therefore a novel player of the PKM2/HIF-1α feedback loop, since HIF-induced PKM2 activates STAT3 that in turn induces HIF-1α expression.

STAT3 is therefore a novel player of the PKM2/HIF-1α feedback loop, since HIF-induced PKM2 activates STAT3 that in turn induces HIF-1α expression. These findings have profound implications for understanding the complex connections between gene regulation, metabolism, survival and proliferation in cancer. Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the penultimate step of glycolysis by transferring phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP to generate ATP and pyruvate, which can then be converted in either lactate or acetyl-CoA to enter the TCA cycle. Of the four known isoforms, PKM1 and PKM2 derive from an alternative splicing of the same pkm2 gene.1 PKM2 is highly expressed in embryonal cells and in tumors, and its prevalent expression in cancer cells has been linked to lower O2 consumption and higher lactate secretion and glucose intake. The switch to the PKM2 isoform, observed in tumors of different origin,2,3 was shown to be essential for both the “Warburg” effect and proliferation of cancer cells.4,5 The main feature distinguishing PKM2 from the PKM1 isoform is the fact that its pyruvate kinase activity is subject to multiple layers of regulation. PKM2 can exist as a tetramer, which is enzymatically active, or as an inactive dimer. Interestingly, tumors show very high levels of dimeric PKM2, which in normal proliferating cells is in contrast mainly tetrameric.6 Multiple signals such as growth factors, oncogenes or reactive oxygen species (ROS) were shown to destabilize the tetrameric form via a number of mechanisms including tyrosine phosphorylation, association with tyrosine phosphopeptides or oxidation.7-9 In turn, decreased PKM2 activity correlates with increased proliferation. Although this can be partly explained by the diversion of glucose metabolites from catabolic to anabolic processes10 and by the increased generation of anti-oxidant NADPH via the pentose phosphate pathway,9 a consistent body of data points toward an independent role for PKM2 in the nucleus. Indeed, it was shown that both IL-3 and EGFR can induce PKM2 nuclear localization, correlating with cell proliferation.11,12 Nuclear PKM2 can associate with cSrc-phosphorylated β-catenin, and bind to the ccnd1 gene promoter activating cyclin D1 transcription.12 Finally, PKM2 was recently proposed to be part of a “feed forward loop” enhancing the activity of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, a key transcriptional regulator of both aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis.13 Indeed, HIF-1 can activate pkm2 gene transcription, and PKM2 in turn interacts with the HIF-1α subunit and promotes trans-activation of HIF-1 target genes, thus enhancing cellular responses to oxygen deprivation or oncogene activation. To investigate the functional significance of nuclear PKM2, Gao et al.14 have compared PKM2 nuclear localization in different cancer cell lines characterized by differential proliferative ability. Interestingly, they observed a strong correlation between PKM2 nuclear levels, cell proliferation and mek5 gene transcription. Upon showing by ChIP analysis that PKM2 associates to the mek5 promoter, they went on demonstrating that nuclear PKM2 interacts with the transcription factor STAT3 and is able to directly trigger its activation via phosphorylation on tyrosine 705. The authors were also able to demonstrate that mek5 is a direct STAT3 transcriptional target and that the levels of dimeric PKM2 directly correlate with STAT3-mediated mek5 transcription, cell proliferation and in vivo growth of tumor cells. Interestingly, PKM2-mediated STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation can be accomplished in vitro exclusively by dimeric PKM2, which uses PEP as a phosphate donor and likely interacts with its substrate via the ADP binding domain. Incidentally, the reaction will lead to pyruvate production via a yet alternative pathway. STAT3 is a point of convergence for many oncogenic signals, and its aberrant constitutive activity is crucial for the survival, proliferation and metastatic activity of tumors of different origin.15 Moreover, STAT3 constitutive activity plays a key role in inflammation-induced cancer, by instating a feed forward loop entailing continuous production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and constitutive NFκB activation.16 We have recently shown that constitutively active STAT3 induces chronically enhanced hif-1α transcription that results in increased HIF-1α protein levels and triggers a metabolic switch toward aerobic glycolysis similar to the Warburg effect.17,18 STAT3 activation appears thus to participate in the recently proposed PKM2/HIF-1α positive feedback loop,13 where oxygen deprivation or oncogenes lead to increased HIF-1α levels, HIF-1 induces pkm2 transcription, PKM2 enhances HIF-1 trans-activating power and activates STAT3 and finally activated STAT3 enhances HIF-1α expression (Fig. 1). On the other hand, we have recently shown that constitutively active STAT3 can act as a first hit during the process of malignant transformation.19 Aberrantly continuous STAT3 activation like that found in chronic inflammation might therefore sensitize cells to tumor transformation by initiating the above described positive feedback loop, leading to enhanced HIF-1α and PKM2 expression/activity. This would in turn support aerobic glycolysis, anabolic cell metabolism, cell survival and proliferation. Moreover, PKM2-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation may participate in the chronic STAT3 activation observed in highly glycolytic tumors of different origins. Although these findings shed some light on the correlation between the tetrameric:dimeric PKM2 ratio, its nuclear activities and enhanced cell proliferation, several questions still remain unanswered. For example, why does PKM2 preferentially localize to the nucleus in more proliferating cells? Is this a special feature of cancer cells? What is the mechanism that drives dimeric PKM2 to the nucleus? An intriguing possibility, adding one more layer of cross-talk, would be that the transcription factors/co-factors known to interact with PKM2, i.e., β-catenin, HIF-1α or STAT3, may mediate its transport to the nucleus. Another interesting implication of the findings by Gao et al. is the idea that STAT3 phosphorylation may take place in the nucleus, opposed to its canonical cytoplasmic activation pathway. This correlates with data sets showing that unphosphorylated STAT3 is continuously shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus generating a reservoir of nuclear unphosphorylated STAT3 available for activation.20 Additionally, the simultaneous detection of both PKM2 and STAT3 on the mek5 promoter suggests that nuclear phosphorylation of STAT3 by PKM2 might even occur on the DNA, similar to what has been recently shown for STAT3 serine phosphorylation.21 Figure 1. STAT3/PKM2/HIF-1α feed forward loop. Oxygen deprivation, growth factors or oncogenes lead to an increase in HIF-1α levels, HIF-1 induces pkm2 transcription, PKM2 both enhances HIF-1 trans-activating power and activates STAT3 and activated STAT3 induces HIF-1α expression. On the other hand, cytokines, growth factors or oncogenes activate STAT3 that can induce hif-1α transcription and start the positive feedback loop between STAT3, PKM2 and HIF-1α. However initiated, this leads to increased levels of proteins involved in glycolysis, enhancing the anaerobic-like metabolism known as Warburg effect. Small molecules enhancing PKM2 tetrameric activity have already been proposed as new therapeutic tools to compromise both the anabolic and the anti-oxidant functions of this protein.9 The same compounds may also lead to the inhibition of PKM2-mediated STAT3 activation, potentially representing a useful therapeutic tool to help hitting the uncontrolled growth of those highly glycolytic tumors that display both STAT3 activation and dimeric PKM2.

Further analysis revealed that the pharynx muscle response is controlled by dense core vesicle secretion from the BAG neurons in a -mediated pathway. This novel pathway sheds new light on the physiological effects of high CO2 levels on animals at the organism-wide level. Introduction One of the fundamental features shared by most, if not all, living organisms is the ability to maintain levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). Of particular importance is the ability of many animals to sense and respond to high levels of CO2 by either attraction or aversion [1]–[5]. In mammals, high levels of CO2 (hypercapnia) impair alveolar epithelial function of the lungs by activating the stress sensor AMPK, which leads to Na,K-ATPase endocytosis, impaired cell proliferation, and loss of distal lung epithelial function [6]–[10]. In addition, hypercapnia suppresses specific innate immune responses in Drosophila and mice, which increases mortality in a model of pneumonia and leads to changes in gene expression through the NF-kB pathway [11]–[14]. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling also plays a role in the response of mammalian cells to elevated CO2 levels [15]–[17]. The molecular pathways mediating the responses to hypercapnia are the focus of intensive research (see [11], [18] and review in [19]). High levels of CO2 quickly elicit an avoidance response in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans animals via a cGMP signaling pathway [2], [4]. The cGMP-regulated avoidance response requires the CO2- and oxygen (O2)–sensing BAG neurons, in which the guanylyl cyclase receptor, gcy-9, controls the response to CO2 [20]–[22]. Interestingly, the response to hypercapnia requires the ETS-domain transcription factor, ETS-5, which controls the expression of gcy-9 in the BAG neurons and plays a role in BAG neuron differentiation [20]–[22]. Recently, the thermosensory AFD neurons and the salt-sensing ASE neurons were also shown to participate in CO2 sensing and avoidance [23]. These neurons, however, differ in their response kinetics to high levels of CO2; whereas BAG neurons reach maximal activation within 30 s, ASE neurons reach maximal activation only after 2 min, and AFD neurons show intricate dynamics in which Ca2+ levels first drop and then increase to maximal levels after 2 min [23]. Interestingly, starved C. elegans do not avoid high CO2 levels, nor do animals with defects in the daf-2 signaling pathway, which is an important regulator of the starvation response [2], [4]. In addition to avoidance, C. elegans exposed to high CO2 levels show specific phenotypes independent of pH [24]. These include a smaller brood size, delayed development, reduced motility coupled with deterioration of striated muscle, and a significant increase in lifespan that is independent of known life-extending pathways [24]. Here we report that exposure of C. elegans animals to short (10 s) hypercapnia-inducing levels of CO2 (≥5%) leads to a significant reduction in the rate of pharyngeal muscle contraction (pumping). Strikingly, this effect is independent of any currently known molecular pathways that regulate CO2 avoidance or O2 sensing. Specifically, through a forward genetic screen, we identified a novel participant in the response to CO2, hid-1, that plays a role in continued pumping in the presence of high CO2 levels. Moreover, we show that dense core vesicle secretion pathways in the BAG neurons contribute to the reduced pumping rate in response to high CO2 levels.ResultsHigh levels of CO2 significantly reduce the pumping rate of the pharynx To investigate the effects of acute exposure of wild-type C. elegans (N2) to high levels of CO2, we exposed 1-day-old adult animals grown on standard NGM plates in a small chamber to gas mixtures containing 21% O2 and 5%, 10%, or 20% CO2 at 22°C. In normal air (0.0391% CO2), the rate of muscle contraction of the pharynx was ∼200 pumps/min. Within 10 s of exposure to 5% CO2 balanced with 21% O2 and 74% N2, the pumping rate of the pharynx was reduced from ∼200 to ∼60 pumps/min (Figure 1A). Exposure to 10% and 20% CO2 almost completely stopped the pumping of the pharynx (Figure 1A and Movie S1). After 2–3 min of continuous exposure to 10% CO2, pumping rate recovered partially to ∼40 pumps/min, and after 5 min of continuous exposure to 10% CO2 it recovered to ∼80 pumps/min (Figure 1B), suggesting a separate, existing mechanism that allows for a partial adaptation. Longer exposures of up to 30 min to 10% CO2 did not result in full recovery of the pumping rate (Figure S1A). To test whether the effect on the pumping is mediated by a change in the pH of the growth medium due to high CO2 levels, we measured the pumping rate of animals using NGM plates buffered to pH of 5.0 and 7.0 in addition to the normally used medium with a pH of 6.0. We did not find any differences between the animals in different growth mediums, both under normal air conditions and after exposure to 10% CO2, which suggests that the effect on the pumping is probably not mediated by changes in pH (Figure S1B). This conclusion is supported by a recent finding that activation of CO2-responsive neurons can occur independently of changes in extracellular or intracellular acidosis [25]. In addition, mutations in the carbonic anhydrase genes (cah-2, cah-5, and cah-6), which catalyze the conversion of CO2 into bicarbonate, had no effect on the pumping rate (Figure S1C). This suggests that the conversion of CO2 into bicarbonate is not necessary to induce the response of the pharynx. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of redundancy between the different carbonic anhydrase genes.10.1371/journal.pgen.1004529.g001Figure 1High levels of CO2 reduce the pumping rate of the pharynx. (A) One-day-old wild-type (N2) adult C. elegans were exposed to 5%, 10%, or 20% CO2 balanced with 21% O2 and N2. The pumping rate was measured under a dissecting microscope while the animals were exposed to different gas mixtures. A gas mixture of 21% O2 and 79% N2 was used as a normal air control. (B) One-day-old wild-type (N2) adult C. elegans were continuously exposed to 10% CO2 for 5 min. The pumping rate was measured during minutes 1, 3, and 5 of exposure to CO2. (C) One-day-old wild-type (N2) adult C. elegans were starved for 4 h and then the pumping rate was measured in 10% or 20% CO2. Well-fed worms were used as a control. In all experiments N≥30 animals. Different groups were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by t test. ***P<.001. Error bars indicate SEM. The response of the pharynx to high CO2 levels was partially dependent on the nutritional state of the animal. Whereas “well fed” animals exposed to 10% CO2 stopped pumping, animals starved for 4 h continued pumping at a rate of ∼60 pumps/min (Figure 1C). These starved animals exposed to 20% CO2 stopped pumping, similar to wild-type animals (Figure 1C), suggesting a threshold effect of high CO2 levels. Together, these data demonstrate that high CO2 levels quickly affect muscle contraction of the pharynx, an effect that depends on the nutritional state of the animal.The reduction in pumping is independent of CO2 avoidance and O2 sensing C. elegans animals quickly withdraw when acutely exposed to CO2. This response, known as CO2 avoidance, is regulated by cGMP signaling [2], [4]. TAX-2 and TAX-4 are two subunits of a cGMP-gated ion channel required for normal chemosensory and thermosensory responses. C. elegans null mutants for either TAX-2 (tax-2[p691]) or TAX-4 (tax-4[p678]) do not avoid high CO2. In addition, the insulin-IGF pathway mediates CO2 avoidance, as daf-2 mutants show reduced CO2 avoidance [2], [4]. The avoidance response also requires proper development of ciliated sensory neurons. Animals with mutations in osm-3 and che-10 have abnormal cilia as well as defective CO2 avoidance. In C. elegans strains carrying mutations in daf-2, osm-3, or che-10 the CO2 avoidance response is either reduced or absent [2], [4]. The effect of high CO2 levels on the C. elegans pharynx is quick and robust, similar to the avoidance response. However, rather than CO2 avoidance, tax-4(p678), daf-2(e1370), osm-3(n1540), and che-10(e1809) mutants show a significant reduction in pumping following exposure to 10% CO2, similar to the reduction observed in wild-type (N2) animals (Figure 2A). Loss-of-function mutation of the neuropeptide Y receptor, npr-1, completely abolishes the CO2 avoidance response by inhibiting the activity of the O2-sensing URX neurons [3]. In our assay, exposing npr-1(ad609) animals to 10% CO2 resulted in a response similar to that of wild-type animals (Figure 2A), suggesting that the high activity of the URX neurons in the animals with loss-of-function mutation in npr-1 does not regulate the pharynx response to CO2. The gcy-9 gene encodes a receptor-type guanylyl cyclase and is a target of the ETS domain ETS-5 transcription factor. Both the ets-5 and gcy-9 genes are required for the CO2 avoidance response [20]–[22]. When exposed to 10% CO2, the gcy-9(tm2816), ets-5(tm1734), and ets-5(tm1755) mutants stopped pumping, similar to wild-type animals (Figure 2B), thus further demonstrating that CO2 avoidance and acute CO2-dependent pumping inhibition are mediated through independent pathways.10.1371/journal.pgen.1004529.g002Figure 2The inhibition of pumping following exposure to high CO2 level is independent of molecular pathways that regulate CO2 avoidance and oxygen sensing. One-day-old adult C. elegans strains containing mutations in genes that regulate CO2 avoidance (A, B) or O2 sensing (C) were exposed to 10% CO2. The pumping rate was measured under a dissecting microscope during the first minute of exposure to CO2. In all experiments N≥30 animals. Different groups were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by t test. ***P<.001. Error bars indicate SEM. To determine whether molecular pathways shared by O2 sensing mediate the response of the pharynx to elevated CO2 levels, we tested strains with mutations in the gcy-31, gcy-33, gcy-35, or gcy-36 genes. These genes encode soluble guanylyl cyclases (sGC) that bind O2 and sense decreases (gcy-31 and gcy-33) or increases (gcy-35 and gcy-36) in O2 levels [26]. Exposing the C. elegans strains gcy-31(ok296), gcy-33(ok232), gcy-35(ok769), or gcy-36(db42) to 10% CO2 resulted in pumping inhibition similar to that observed in wild-type animals (Figure 2C). These results suggest that the effect of high CO2 levels on the pumping rate does not involve O2 sensing.HID-1 is required for the CO2-dependent pumping response To identify genes that are involved in regulating the pharynx response to 10% CO2, we performed a forward genetic screen after ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. Specifically, we screened for mutant animals that do not stop pumping in response to 10% CO2 (Movie S2). We screened the progeny of ∼1200 F1 animals and found three strains that continued pumping when exposed to 10% CO2. One of these strains was further crossed to the Hawaiian strain, and deep sequencing was performed on DNA from recombinant F2 progeny. The region containing the mutant gene that enabled continuous pumping in 10% CO2 was identified by searching for a low number of Hawaiian single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as described elsewhere [27]. This mutant strain has a premature stop codon in a previously characterized highly conserved gene, hid-1. In 5% CO2, unlike in wild-type animals, the pumping rate of animals with the isolated hid-1(yg316) allele was similar to the pumping rate in normal air conditions, and significant pumping continued after exposure to 10% CO2, whereas in 20% CO2 pumping was abolished (Figure 3A).10.1371/journal.pgen.1004529.g003Figure 3HID-1 is required for sensing CO2 level in the pharynx. (A) One-day-old adult hid-1(yg316) and N2 worms were exposed to 5%, 10%, or 20% CO2 balanced with 21% O2 and N2. The pumping rate was measured under a dissecting microscope while the animals were exposed to the different gas mixtures. A gas mixture of 21% O2 and 79% N2 was used as a normal air control. (B) The inhibition of the pumping rate of the pharynx after exposure to high CO2 level in hid-1(yg316) allele mutants is significantly reduced. Similarly, the inhibition of the pumping rate of the pharynx after exposure to high CO2 level is reduced in other hid-1 allele mutants (sa772 and sa1058). Transgenic expression of HID-1 fused to eGFP in the sa722 or yg316 background (hid-1(sa722);HID-1::GFP or hid-1(yg316);HID-1::GFP) is sufficient to restore the effect of high CO2 level on the pumping rate back to the wild-type phenotype. In all experiments N≥30 animals. Different groups were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by t test. ***P<.001. Error bars indicate SEM. The effect of HID-1 on the response to high levels of CO2 was specific to the pharynx, since hid-1 mutant animals still showed reduced egg laying (Figure S2) and a slower rate of development (data not shown), similar to wild-type animals exposed to high CO2 levels [24]. Two other alleles of hid-1, sa722 and sa1058 [28], also showed continuous pumping when exposed to 10% CO2 (Figure 3B). The change in pumping rate in response to CO2 is specific to HID-1, since transgenic expression of HID-1::GFP under its own promoter, in either hid-1(sa722) or hid-1(yg316) strains (Figure S3), was sufficient to restore the normal reduced pumping rate in 10% CO2 (Figure 3B). Together, these data suggest that hid-1 is required for the response of the pharynx to high levels of CO2.Other dense core vesicle secretion and maturation mutants are also involved in the inhibition of pumping by CO2 Dense core vesicles (DCVs) secrete neuropeptides in peptidergic neurons [29]. HID-1 is associated with Golgi membranes by way of N-terminal myristoylation and is required for the sorting of DCVs, where it prevents sorting of peptide cargoes to lysosomes for degradation [30]–[32]. We hypothesized that HID-1 plays a role in the response of the pharynx to high CO2 by regulating neuropeptide secretion. We tested this hypothesis by scoring pumping response to 10% CO2 in mutants defective in other genes involved in neuropeptide secretion. The gene unc-31 encodes the C. elegans ortholog of CAPS (calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion), an important component of DCV exocytosis [33]. The gene egl-21 encodes the C. elegans ortholog of carboxypeptidase E, an important component in neuropeptide maturation [34]. Following exposure of unc-31(e928) or egl-21(n476) deletion strains to 10% CO2, the pumping rate of the pharynx was significantly higher compared with that in wild-type animals exposed to the same concentration of CO2 (Figure 4A). We also tested the role of synaptic vesicle secretion on the pumping response to 10% CO2. The unc-13 gene is involved in synaptic vesicle secretion of neurotransmitters [35], [36]. The rab-3 gene is a Rab GTPase that affects the distribution of synaptic vesicle populations [37]. Exposure of unc-13(e1091) or rab-3(js49) mutant strains to 10% CO2 showed pumping behavior similar to that of wild-type strains (Figure 4A). These data suggest that DCVs play an important role in mediating the response of the pharynx to high CO2 levels and that compromising DCV secretion probably impairs the pumping response to high CO2 levels.10.1371/journal.pgen.1004529.g004Figure 4The effect of high CO2 level on the pharynx requires HID-1 activity in the BAG neurons. (A) One-day-old adult C. elegans strains containing mutations in unc-31 or egl-21 genes, which are important for proper neuropeptide secretion and maturation, show a significant rescue of the pumping rate after exposure to 10% CO2. In contrast, strains with mutations in unc-13 or rab-3, which promote synaptic vesicle secretion, do not show a changed pharynx response to 10% CO2. (B) Transgenic expression of HID-1 in the gut using the gut-specific ges-1 promoter (ges-1p-HID-1::GFP) was not sufficient to restore pumping phenotype to wild type after exposure to 10% CO2. In contrast, transgenic expression of HID-1 in neurons using the rab-3 promoter (rab-3p-HID-1::GFP) was sufficient to restore pumping rate after exposure to 10% CO2 almost back to wild-type levels. Cell-specific expression of HID-1 in the AFD neurons (gcy-8p-HID-1::GFP) or in the amphid and tail ciliated neurons, including ASE neurons (osm-6p-HID-1::GFP), did not restore the CO2 effect on the pumping back to wild-type levels, whereas cell-specific expression of HID-1 in sensory and pharyngeal neurons (nlp-3p-HID-1::GFP) or in BAG neurons (flp-17p-HID-1::GFP and gcy-33p-HID-1::GFP) was sufficient to restore the effect of high CO2 level back to the wild-type phenotype. (C) The BAG neurons of wild-type C. elegans expressing gcy-33::GFP were laser ablated and the pharyngeal pumping rate was measured in normal air and 10% CO2. Similarly, the BAG neurons of flp-17p::HID-1::GFP and gcy-33p::HID-1::GFP strains were laser ablated and the pharyngeal pumping rate subsequently measured. Controls include measurement of the pumping rate in the same C. elegans strains without ablation. (D) Transgenic expression of HID-1 in the BAG neurons of hid-1(sa722);gcy-9(tm2816) animals restores the suppression of pumping in the presence of high CO2 level. (E) Schematic model of CO2 response of pharyngeal muscle contraction. The inhibition of muscle contraction in the pharynx is mediated by neuropeptide secretion via dense core vesicles (DCVs) in BAG neurons. The CO2 response is decreased after starvation. In all experiments N≥30 animals, except in panel C in flp-17p::HID-1::GFP (N = 5) and gcy-33p::HID-1::GFP (N = 10). Different groups were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by t test. ***P<.001. Error bars indicate SEM.Expression of HID-1 in the BAG neurons is sufficient to restore wild-type CO2 response in hid-1 mutant strains HID-1 is expressed in all neuron and gut cells of C. elegans [30]. To test whether inhibition of pharynx pumping in response to 10% CO2 requires expression of hid-1 in the gut, neurons, or both, we used transgenic lines that express HID-1 fused to GFP driven by either the pan-neuronal promoter rab-3 or the gut-specific promoter ges-1. Expression of HID-1 under the rab-3 promoter in neurons of hid-1(sa722) background was sufficient to restore inhibition of the pharynx pumping almost to the levels shown by wild-type animals (Figure 4B). In contrast, expression of HID-1 under the ges-1 promoter in the gut of hid-1(sa722) had no significant effect on the response of the pharynx to 10% CO2. We next asked which subset of neurons is required for mediating the effect of high CO2 levels on the pharynx. The nlp-3 gene is expressed in sensory neurons (ADF, ASE, ASH, AWB, ASJ, and BAG) as well as in pharyngeal neurons (I1, I2, I3, I4, M1, M3, and NSMR) (Figure S3) [38]. Transgenic expression of HID-1::GFP under the nlp-3 promoter in hid-1(sa722) background was sufficient to restore pharynx pumping inhibition after exposure to 10% CO2 (Figure 4B). High levels of CO2 activate the AFD neurons [23]. Surprisingly, transgenic expression of HID-1::GFP driven by a gcy-8 promoter in the thermosensory AFD of hid-1(sa722) background did not restore the CO2-mediated pumping inhibition (Figure 4B), which suggests that the activation of the AFD neurons by high CO2 levels is not sufficient to induce the peptidergic signaling that mediates the effect of high CO2 levels on the pharynx. Among the sensory neurons expressing nlp-3 are the BAG and the ASE neurons, which are also known to respond to high CO2 levels [23]. Transgenic expression of HID-1::GFP driven by the osm-6 promoter, which was expressed in ASE neurons (undetected in BAG neurons), did not restore the CO2-mediated pumping inhibition (Figure 4B). We next tested the role of BAG neurons in the CO2-dependent pumping inhibition of the pharynx. Transgenic lines expressing HID-1::GFP under the promoter of flp-17 showed expression in the BAG neurons (Figure S3). This expression was sufficient to fully restore the CO2-dependent pumping inhibition (Figure 4B). Similarly, the expression of HID-1::GFP under the gcy-33 promoter in hid-1(sa722) background was specific to the BAG neurons (Figure S3) [21]. This expression was sufficient to fully restore the CO2-dependent pumping inhibition (Figure 4B). Next, we ablated the BAG neurons in transgenic worms expressing HID-1::GFP under flp-17 and gcy-33 promoters in hid-1(sa722) background. We found that following the removal of the HID-1::GFP-expressing BAG neurons, the pumping in 10% CO2 was similar to that of hid-1(sa722) animals (Figure 4C). These results suggest that the specific expression of HID-1 in the BAG neurons is sufficient to induce the CO2-dependent pumping inhibition. We also ablated the BAG neurons in wild-type background using GFP driven by gcy-33 promoter as a marker. We found that following ablation of the BAG neurons, the pumping in response to 10% CO2 was similar to that in HID-1-null animals (Figure 4C). These results suggest that the BAG neurons are required for the pumping inhibition. In addition, to test possible cross talk between the neuropeptide secretion pathway and the guanylyl cyclase receptor pathway, which is required for CO2 avoidance, we measured the pharyngeal pumping rate of animals carrying both hid-1(sa722) and gcy-9(tm2816) mutations. The pumping rate was similar to that of hid-1(sa722) animals (Figure 4D). Moreover, in the same genetic background, transgenic expression of HID-1 in the BAG neurons, using the flp-17 promoter, restored the suppression of pumping in the presence of high CO2 level (Figure 4D), further demonstrating that the response to CO2 mediated by hid-1 is independent of the response to CO2 mediated by gcy-9. We conclude that proper hid-1 activity in the BAG neurons is important to mediate the pumping inhibition by CO2.Discussion In humans, high CO2 levels have diverse effects on the lung epithelium, immunity, and muscle function. However, the effects of acute exposure of muscle cells to high CO2 levels were unknown. In addition, recent studies suggest that mammals, like C. elegans, are able to sense elevated CO2 levels, which is of broad physiologic significance.CO2 avoidance and CO2-dependent reduced pharyngeal pumping are probably regulated via different pathways Acute exposure of well-fed adult C. elegans animals to high CO2 levels quickly reduces the pumping rate of the pharynx. This effect depends in part on the nutritional status of the animal, since starved animals exposed to 10% CO2 in air continue to pump, albeit at a significantly slower rate. Our genetic data suggest that the effect of acute exposure to high CO2 levels on the pumping rate is independent of the avoidance responses of C. elegans to high CO2 levels. First, cGMP signaling is required for mediating the avoidance response, as mutations in the cGMP gated ion channel encoded by tax-2 and tax-4 completely disrupt the avoidance response [2], [4]. In contrast, the same mutation in tax-4 does not completely rescue the immediate response of the pumping rate to high CO2 levels. Second, mutation in the insulin-like receptor encoded by daf-2 also disrupts the avoidance response [2], [4]. The pumping rate of daf-2 mutants under exposure to 10% CO2 is dramatically reduced, like in the wild-type animals. The limited recovery of the pumping rate in daf-2 mutants at 10% CO2 could be due to the effect of daf-2 on starvation regulating pathways [39], [40]. Third, interference with proper function of ciliated sensory neurons by mutations in osm-3 and che-10 also significantly changes the avoidance response. Again, in the pumping assay, similar mutations in these genes did not change the response of C. elegans to high CO2 levels. In addition, mutations in ets-5 and gcy-9, which were previously shown to be required for the calcium response of the BAG neurons to CO2, did not change the response of the pharynx to high CO2 levels. Finally, the rescue of pumping by hid-1 in the BAG neurons was not affected by gcy-9 mutations. C. elegans animals presumably interpret high CO2 levels as a harmful cue that leads to avoidance and pumping inhibition. The ability of the animal to stop eating for several minutes probably allows it to avoid undesirable food. Surprisingly, although both the avoidance and the pumping responses to the same stressful cue are immediate, our genetic data suggest that different molecular pathways mediate the two responses to high CO2.The potential role of neuropeptides in the response of the pharynx to high levels of CO2 Our genetic screen identified hid-1 as a regulator of the pumping response to high CO2 levels, as mutations in the hid-1 gene blunted the response of the pharynx to high CO2 levels. HID-1 is required for the neuropeptide secretion pathway [30], [32]. Indeed, mutations in other known genes in peptidergic signaling, unc-31 and egl-21, could also partially suppress the pharyngeal pumping suppression upon exposure to 10% CO2. Neuropeptides are important signaling molecules in many physiological responses both in C. elegans and in other organisms. In C. elegans there are more than 250 neuropeptides that play a role in feeding and metabolism, and most neurons in C. elegans secrete neuropeptides [41]. Neuropeptides are also secreted from the intestine [38], and hid-1, an important peptidergic signaling gene, is expressed both in the nervous system and in the intestine [30], [32]. Neuropeptide signaling was previously shown to regulate pumping inhibition in the absence of food [42]. Specifically, unc-31 mutants demonstrate continuous pumping in the absence of food, unlike wild-type animals [42]. Since hid-1 also partially suppresses the inhibition of pumping in the absence of food (data not shown), we cannot completely rule out the possibility that hid-1 generally inhibits pumping and acts in parallel with CO2. The pharynx response to 10% CO2 is probably mediated by several different neuropeptides, since pumping inhibition could not be inhibited by deletion of individual neuropeptide genes known to be overexpressed in the BAG neurons, including flp-10, flp-16, flp-27, nlp-1, flp-17, and nlp-14 (Figure S4). Neuropeptide secretion can only partially explain the response of the pharynx to high levels of CO2, since none of the peptidergic signaling mutants we examined at 10% CO2 (hid-1, unc-31, and egl-21) exhibited the pumping rate seen at normal air levels (Figure 4). Thus we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the effects of unc-31 and egl-21 are due to the other pathway(s) that must be acting in parallel with hid-1. This implies the existence of other, HID-1-independent mechanisms that must regulate the response of the pharynx to CO2 levels. For example, it is possible that high CO2 levels trigger other presynaptic inputs that mediate the effect on the pharynx in parallel with the peptidergic signaling, or that CO2 has also a direct postsynaptic effect on the pharyngeal muscles that inhibits their normal function. Interestingly, such parallel pathways depend on the CO2 levels, since hid-1 completely rescues the pumping inhibition at 5% CO2 and fails to rescue the pumping at 20% CO2 (Figure 3A).The presence of HID-1 is specifically required in the BAG neurons Using transgenic lines that express HID-1 either in the gut or in the nervous system we have determined that the hid-1 activity is specifically required in neurons to mediate the effect of high CO2 levels on the pharynx. We used an AFD-specific promoter to show that hid-1 activity in the AFD neurons, which are activated by high CO2 levels [23], is not sufficient to mediate the effect of high CO2 levels on the pharynx. In contrast, transgenic expression of HID-1::GFP under the nlp-3 promoter is sufficient to restore CO2-mediated pharynx pumping inhibition. Using the BAG-specific promoters flp-17 and gcy-33 and performing ablation experiments on the BAG neurons, we have further narrowed the CO2 effect on the pharynx to the BAG neurons. Paradoxically, our genetic data (Figures 2 and 4) suggest the existence of different molecular pathways for the avoidance and the pharynx responses. However, the BAG neurons in the pharynx response are the same neurons that control the avoidance response. Interestingly, mutant animals that block CO2-mediated calcium response in the BAG neurons still show normal pumping inhibition. The existence of such a pathway is especially surprising given that DCV secretion is expected to depend on an increase in calcium levels. The physiological and molecular effects of high CO2 levels, in both vertebrates and invertebrates, have been the focus of several recent studies [2], [4], [6], [7], [12], [14], [22], [24], [43]. However, the sensing mechanism of cells to high CO2 levels is yet largely unknown. Soluble adenylyl cyclases are bicarbonate sensors in several organisms including mammals [15], [44], [45]. In C. elegans, which do not have soluble adenylyl cyclases, the soluble guanylyl cyclases GCY-31 and GCY-33 are important for eliciting CO2 avoidance in the BAG neurons [23]. However, it is yet unknown whether the gcy genes are directly activated by either CO2 or HCO3−. Our results show that neither GCY-31 nor GCY-33 are required for mediating the effect of high CO2 levels on the pharynx (Figure 2C). Our study sheds new light on the response of C. elegans to high CO2 levels. It also shows that the CO2-induced response is differentially regulated across different tissues. Furthermore, different levels of CO2 lead to various outcomes in the same tissue. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying these fundamental pathways will hopefully help us to better understand the CO2-induced responses that are activated in human diseases.Materials and MethodsStrains Worms were handled as described elsewhere [46].

All strains were obtained from the C. elegans Genome Center (CGC) or the National BioResourse Project (NBRP), except for CX2948, which was kindly provided by the De-Bono laboratory, and NM3017, NM3053, and NM3139, which were kindly provided by the Nonet laboratory [2], [30].Measurement of pumping rate A standard NGM plate covered with a lid-shaped chamber with inlet and outlet holes to allow gas flow was used to measure the pumping rate under different concentrations of CO2 in air. The chamber was connected to a mechanical valve that controlled the humidified gas mixture entering the chamber. For all pumping assays, NGM plates were seeded with 20 µL of OP50 5 h before the experiment to allow normal feeding and to keep worms in a restricted area. A single 1-day-old adult worm was seeded on a plate just before the start of the experiment. Initially, normal air mixture (21% O2, 79% N2) flowed into the chamber and worms were allowed to adjust for 1 min. The number of pharynx muscle contractions was subsequently measured for 1 min under normal air conditions. Then the airflow was switched to a high-CO2 gas mixture, and after 10 s the pharynx muscle contraction rate was measured again. To measure pumping rate after starvation, well-fed wild-type 1-day-old adult worms were collected using M9 buffer and washed four or five times in M9 buffer. Worms were then seeded on either NGM plates with no bacteria or NGM plates seeded with OP50, for 4 h prior to measurements. All pumping assays were performed at 22°C.EMS screen and SNP mapping The EMS mutagenesis was performed essentially as described elsewhere [46]. Briefly, wild-type (N2) worms in the L4 stage were exposed to 50 mM EMS in M9 buffer for 4 h and then transferred to fresh plates for 2–3 h (P0) for recovery. After recovery, five P0 animals were transferred again to an NGM plate and allowed to lay F1 progeny. Adult F1 animals were cloned onto individual NGM plates and their L4-adult F2 progeny where exposed to 10% CO2. F2 worms that continued the pumping of the pharynx even after exposure to 10% CO2 were isolated. In total, we scored the progeny of ∼1200 F1 animals. The isolated strains were outcrossed three times. The mutation was mapped as described elsewhere [27]. Mutant worms were crossed with the Hawaiian strain and F1 progeny were isolated. Then 44 F2 recombinants that continued the pumping after exposure to 10% CO2 were isolated, and the DNA of their F3 and F4 offspring was extracted using a Gentra Puregene kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 158667). Whole genome sequencing was performed using the Applied Biosystems SOLiD 3 deep sequencing apparatus. The positions of the Hawaiian SNPs were mapped on the DNA of the yg316 strain. A 1.2-MB region in chromosome X that did not contain any Hawaiian SNP was found. Within this region a premature stop codon (W625X) in the coding sequence of hid-1 was found to cause the phenotype as described in the text.Plasmid constructs, transgenes, and laser ablation The NM1699 construct, which contains the hid-1 promoter driving the genomic hid-1 coding region fused to eGFP, was a kind gift from the Nonet laboratory [30]. The NM1699 construct was digested with KpnI and AatII to replace the native hid-1 promoter with various neuron-specific promoters. To drive AFD-specific expression an 800-bp fragment upstream of the gcy-8 start codon was amplified and subsequently digested with KpnI-AatII to generate pKS10. Similarly, to drive sensory and pharyngeal specific expression, a 700-bp fragment upstream of the nlp-3 start codon was amplified and digested with KpnI-AatII to generate pKS20. To drive BAG-specific expression a 3.4-kb fragment upstream of the flp-17 start codon was amplified and fused by PCR to HID-1::GFP from NM1699. In addition, to drive BAG-specific expression a 980-bp fragment upstream of the gcy-33 start codon was amplified and subsequently digested with KpnI-AatII to generate pKS30. All plasmids were verified by sequencing and microinjected to either JT722 or YG316 with an elt-2::GFP marker as described elsewhere [47]. Laser ablation was performed using an Andor Revolution XD confocal spinning disk system with a Nikon TiE inverted microscope equipped with a nitrogen pulsed laser and a 365-nm Micropoint dye cell. The microscope and laser were controlled by means of IQ software and the Micropoint Mosaic I System 85-75, respectively. The region of interest was set according to the size of the neuron cell body as revealed by the GFP marker. We used a frequency of 15 Hz, an energy range of 80%–90%, and 3–5 repeats in order to completely ablate the GFP marker in the neuron cell body.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Pumping inhibition is not rescued by either 30 min of exposure to 10% CO2, pH of 5.0 or 7.0, or mutations in the carbonic anhydrase genes.

[BMB Reports 2012; 45(12): 700-706] INTRODUCTION The number of obese people is expected to dramatically elevate in both developed and developing countries. Besides the associated increased mortality, obesity has been closely related with a wide spectrum of co-morbidities such as arthritis, cholelithiasis, diabetes, gout and certain types of cancers. Moreover, obesity is at the center of the metabolic syndromes and insulin resistance which predispose patients to enhanced risk of cardiovascular diseases and type II diabetes (1-3). The economical aspect of obesity as well as that which is associated with the multiple related adverse health effects are also of concern. Obesity is a very complex disease that involves a number of interactions among genetic and environmental factors. In order to treat and overcome obesity, we must develop a deeper understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of adipose tissue growth in physiological and pathophysiological states leading to weight gain. The expansion of adipose tissue results not only from increased adipocyte size (hypertrophy), but also from increased adipocyte numbers (hyperplasia) (Fig. 1). Hyperplasia occurs via de novo differentiation of preadipocytes, which are located in the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue (4). Thus, a more detailed understanding of the signal transduction mechanisms of adipogenic differentiation is critical. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) play crucial roles in the regulation of cellular functions, acting in concert with protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) to control the phosphorylation level of tyrosine residues (5). Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation regulates important signaling pathways involved in the control of adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation. Although equal and balanced activities of PTKs and PTPs have been reported in many physiological processes, the recent findings of several studies contribute to the idea that PTPs have specific, active and even dominant roles in tyrosine phosphorylation (6,7). Furthermore, several PTPs seem to act as biochemical “on” or “off” switches and as key regulators in many intracellular signaling pathways (8).Fig. 1.Obesity is an increase of adipose tissue as a means of storing excess energy. There are two possible growth mechanisms: hyperplasia (cell number increase) and hypertrophy (cell size increase). In this review, we briefly introduce PTPs and adipogenic differentiation. We then review the functional roles of PTPs in adipogenic differentiation, and suggest the possibility of PTPs as potential targets for the treatment of obesity.Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily The phosphorylation of proteins is a key cellular post-translational modifications (PTMs) which occur during various cellular processes, and mainly occurs in serine and threonine residues, as well as tyrosine to a lesser degree. However, tyrosine phosphorylation occurs specifically in multicellular eukaryotes, and plays important roles in cellular metabolism, growth, signal transduction, differentiation, gene regulation and apoptosis (7). The equilibrium of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is achieved by the balanced action between PTKs and PTPs (9). It had been considered that PTPs were mainly housekeeping enzymes that merely turned signaling processes off. However, it has been reported that the almost half of PTPs are implicated in human diseases such as cancers and metabolic diseases, indicating the functional importance of PTPs (10). Now, it is generally accepted that PTPs act as both negative and positive regulators of various signaling pathways. The catalytic domain of PTPs contains about 280 residues, and is defined by the conserved active site sequence [I/V] HCXXGXXR[S/T], which has been termed the PTP signature motif. The human genome encodes a total of 107 PTPs, which are classified into four evolutionary separate subfamilies: class I, II, and Cys-based PTPs (III) and Asp-based phosphatases (class IV) (11,12). There are 99 PTP members of the class I subfamily in the human genome, and they can be subclassified into the classical PTPs (21 receptor-type and 17 non-receptor type PTPs), and the VH1-like phosphatase group, which contains the eleven MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), the 19 atypical dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), the three singleshots, the three PRLs, the four CDC14s, the PTEN/tensin group, and the 16 myotubularins. Among these, the receptor-type PTPs are found only in multicellular organisms, and additionally, PTPs show delicate substrate and functional specificity (13). Therefore, detailed examinations of the structure, function, and regulation of the PTP superfamily are necessary to understand a wide range of key physiological processes.The relationship between adipogenic differentiation and obesity Adipose tissue is loose connective tissue which is composed of adipocyte cells, and plays critical roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis as both an energy reservoir and endocrine organ (14). Obesity, or excess body fat, does not depend on, or cannot be determined by body weight, but on the amount of body fat, and more specifically that of adipose tissue. Obesity is a chronic health problem which now affects many people worldwide, and hence, a deeper understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation is necessary to overcome the obesity. There are two types of adipocyte, white adipocyte and brown adipocyte, which have opposite functions in energy balance. White adipocytes store excess energy as triglycerides in lipid droplets, whereas brown adipocytes release energy in the form of heat through thermogenesis (15-17). It has been reported that brown adipose tissue plays an important role in the maintenance of body temperature and energy balance in rodents. In human, it has been considered until recently that brown adipose tissue is present in neonates but disappears early in life. However, the presence of brown adipose tissue in human adults has been verified quite recently (18). Furthermore, there are accumulating reports showing a good correlation between obesity and the amount of brown adipose tissue in the body (19,20). Thus, the signal mechanisms studies of brown adipogenesis are also very interesting with regard to the treatment and prevention of obesity. The molecular mechanism of brown adipogenic differentiation has not been as extensively investigated as that of white adipogenic differentiation however, due to its only recent identification in adult human (17-20). While further investigation of brown adipose tissue holds significant implications for the future management of this worldwide epidemic, there is a lack of basic genetic and physiological information regarding their formation and propagation, and hence, we cover only white adipogenic differentiation in this review.Molecular mechanisms of adipogenic differentiation Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells that can differentiate into a variety of mesodermal-lineage cells, including adipocytes. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation are regulated via fine controlling of several adipogenic intracellular signaling pathways (Fig. 2). Many genetic processes have been revealed to be involved in adipogenic differentiation, through the use of either preadipocyte cell lines, such as 3T3-L1 or 3T3-F442A, primary SVF, embryonic fibroblasts, or bone marrow stromal cells, all of which can be efficiently differentiated into adipocyte cells in vitro (21). The master adipogenesis regulator is the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which is mandatory for the adipocyte lineage as well as for the maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype. CCAAT-enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) also play important roles in adipogenesis, with C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ expressed during early stages of adipogenic differentiation, inducing the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα (22,23). In multipotent cells, it has been known that differentiation into one myogenic, osteogenic or adipogenic lineage reciprocally inhibits differentiation into others (24). The most well-known case is the reciprocal regulation of PPARγ and RUNX2 which determine between adipogenic versus osteogenic fate (25). Besides transcriptional regulation, extracellular signaling is also an important factor for controlling adipogenesis. Wnt10b, sonic hedgehog (SHH) or TGF-β are the secreted proteins that trigger the inhibitory signaling pathways. On the other hand, extracellular proteins promoting adipogenesis include several members of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) family (26).Fig. 2.Regulatory signals of adipocyte differentiation. Several signals act as activators and/or repressors during adipogenesis. They are integrated in the nucleus by transcription factors that directly or indirectly regulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) and CCAATenhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBP-α). Insulin signaling has profound effects on adipogenesis. The mechanisms of insulin are mediated by a cascade of tyrosine phosphorylation events which are initiated by the binding of insulin to its receptor (27,28). Insulin binding induces the stimulation of kinase activity of the insulin receptor (IR) and the phosphorylation of IR substrates (IRSs), which lead to the activation of downstream signal molecules, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt. Then, activated Akt controls the activities of several downstream target proteins involved in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis and adipogenesis (27,29,30) Downstream components of the insulin signal cascade are crucial for adipogenic differentiation. The depletion of individual IRS proteins, including the combined deletion of IRS1 and IRS2, leads to the significant reduction of adipogenesis (31-33). Furthermore, repression of PI3K and the loss of Akt inhibit adipogenesis by the regulation of several adipogenic and anti-adipogenic transcription factors (33-36).The functional roles of protein tyrosine phosphatases in adipogenic differentiation A number of growth-factor and hormone receptors belong to the tyrosine kinase receptor family, and undergo phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at tyrosine residues in a concerted manner in response to various stimulus in order to initiate/maintain the signaling cascade pathway (37,38). Termination of the insulin signal cascade is also accomplished by PTPs, which dephosphorylate and inactivate the IR, inactivating its downstream substrates. PTPs contain a large family of receptor-type or intracellular enzymes that function as either positive or negative regulators of intracellular key signaling pathways (12,39,40). Several PTPs, including leukocyte common antigen related (LAR; also known as PTP-RF) phosphatase, PTP-α, PTP-1B and SHPTP2 (also known as Syp), are highly expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. These enzymes are been determined to be involved in insulin signaling through the use of various experimental approaches. Our group reported the involvement of several PTPs in adipogenic differentiation of human MSCs (41-43). According to data from PTP profiling analysis during adipogenic differentiation of human MSCs, many PTPs are differentially expressed during adipogenesis, especially during the early phases. PTP-RQ is classified as a receptor-type III PTP with phosphatidylinositol phosphatase (PIPase) activity, and has been determined to be decreased during the early phase of adipogenesis. This leads to an escalation of the intracellular PIP3 level, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of Akt/PKB, and consequently, the promotion of adipogenic differentiation (41). LAR phosphatase (also known as PTP-RF) is also implicated in adipogenesis. It has been shown that the expression of LAR is dramatically decreased during early adipogenic stages of MSCs. Knockdown of endogenous LAR induced a significant increase in adipogenic differentiation, whereas its ectopic overexpression led to reduced adipogenic differentiation in both 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and MSCs. LAR reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, in turn leading to decreased phosphorylation of the adaptor protein IRS-1 and its downstream molecule Akt. Therefore, we propose that LAR functions as a negative regulator of adipogenesis. Furthermore, we suggest the possibility that LAR controls the balance between osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation in a reciprocal manner (42). Recently, we also reported that RPTPμ (also known as PTP-RM), a receptor-type PTP, acts as a positive regulator of adipogenesis by modulating the cytoplasmic p120 catenin level (43). The expression of RPTPμ is markedly increased during the adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and human MSCs. RPTPμ interacts directly with p120 catenin and controls its tyrosine phosphorylation state. RPTPμ significantly reduced p120 catenin tyrosine phosphorylation at the early phase of adipogenic differentiation. The p120 catenin protein exists in equilibrium between two states -either bound to the membrane-proximal region of E-cadherin or free in the cytoplasm (44,45). The data clearly indicate that p120 catenin distribution depends on its tyrosine phosphorylation state, which is regulated by RPTPμ phos-phatase activity. In adipocytes, insulin increases the levels of glucose transport by stimulating the translocation of Glut-4 from intracellular sites to the plasma membrane (46). Our results clearly show that cytoplasmic p120 catenin suppresses Glut-4 membrane translocation, and represses Glut-4 membrane trafficking by recovering p120 catenin by RPTPμ ectopic overexpression, suggesting that RPTPμ-mediated regulation of adipogenesis functions by increasing the Glut-4 membrane trafficking activity (43). Collectively, our group strongly showed that differentiation into adipocytes can be finely regulated in vitro by controlling the PTPs, supporting the utility of PTPs as novel target proteins for the treatment of obesity.Table 1.

The agents controlling the activity of these PTPs could be used as anti-obesity drugs in the future. Several other groups also reported the involvement of PTPs in adipogenesis. Uehara et al. of the Suzuki group reported that SHP-2 (also known as PTP-N11) phosphatase plays a positive role in adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells (47). Although it has been known that SHP-2 binds and dephosphorylates IRS-1 (48), there was no explanation provided as to how SHP-2 regulates adipogenic differentiation. Kasuga group also reported that MKP-1 (also known as DUSP-1) increases during adipogenic differentiation, and that this protein plays an essential role in differentiation by down-regulating the activity of p42/p44 MAPK (49). In addition, it was reported that PTP-BL (also known as PTP-N13) represents a novel adipogenic factor that is required for adipocyte differentiation, but is independent of its catalytic activity (50). In the case of PTP-1B, it has been widely accepted that PTP-1B is non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase and a key negative regulator of leptin and insulin signaling (5). However, the functional role of PTP-1B in adipose tissue is less well known. Recently, Owen et al. reported that, surprisingly, PTP-1B does not appear to be the major negative regulator of IR in adipocytes (51). Although PTP-1B may be not be a key regulator of insulin signaling in adipocytes, it is obvious that PTP-1B is a useful validated therapeutic target for obesity. Several groups, including our own, have been extensively involved in the investigation of the involvement of PTPs in adipogenic differentiation (Table 1, Fig. 3).The possibility of novel drug targets of protein tyrosine phosphatases for treatment of obesity The number of human diseases associated with PTP abnormalities is constantly rising, and thus, small molecules which are able to regulate PTPs hold enormous potential for the treatment of diseases, including many of those associated with obesity. However, the development of molecules regulating PTP activities has been relatively slow compared to those of PTK (52-56). The main bottleneck restricting drug development relating to PTPs is the lack of biologically well-validated targets. Although several PTPs have been proposed as potential drug targets, until now, only PTP-1B has been well-validated as having a significant association with disease (5,56). As mentioned above, the agents regulating the activity of PTPs involved intimately in adipogenic differentiation could be used as anti-obesity drug targets.CONCLUSION The PTP superfamily is an important regulatory component in key signal transduction pathways, cellular functions, apoptosis and insulin signaling. A number of human diseases associated with the malfunction of PTP have provided the motive to recognize PTPs as drug targets. Several PTPs are intimately involved in adipogenesis via modulating the phosphorylation of specific target substrate(s). The regulation of adipogenic differentiation is related to overcoming obesity and thus, PTPs involved in adipogenesis could be used as valuable novel target proteins for the treatment of obesity.

Introduction Exopolysaccharides are long chain biopolymers composed of repeating units of sugar moieties connected via glycosidic linkages and may be obtained from plant as well as microbial sources. In past, terrestrial polymer producing microorganisms have received significant attention in comparison to other natural resources. Although, marine system consists around 70% of the volume of earth, still, this huge diverse environment is relatively less explored. However, in recent time exploitation of marine microflora for isolation of novel bioactive molecules has gained significant interest among researchers worldwide. Marine environment is characterized by extreme physicochemical conditions and harbours unusual microbes with potential of different biotechnological applications. Hence, in order to survive in such conditions marine microbes follow some unique biochemical pathways resulting in the production of novel bioactive compounds including, exopolysaccharides [1], [2]. More importantly, marine microbes tend to have significant osmotic tolerance leading to their capability of polysaccharide production at higher sugar concentration, which is very much desired for development of an economically feasible process for polysaccharide production. Development of suitable application of these biocompounds is also important. Polysaccharides already have found applications in several industrial segments including food, pharmaceuticals and chemical industries [3], [4]. In recent times, biogenic production of metal nanoparticles has also drawn significant interest from scientists. Although, mostly microbes and plant extracts [5], [6] have been utilized for synthesis of metal nanoparticles, however, in both cases the mechanisms for production is ill-defined and the final product may contain several impurities leading towards bio-incompatibility of the produced nanoparticles. Hence, there is a strong need of green, easy and biocompatible technique for metal nanoparticle synthesis. Microbial exopolysaccharides seem to be a promising alternative as they can effectively act as strong reducing as well as stabilizing agent for metal nanoparticle production [7]. Silver nanoparticle has obtained significant attention of researchers due to its potential high value applications in biomedical and pharmaceutical industries. There are few reports available on production of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using polysaccharides such as heparin, hyaluronic acid, cellulose, starch, alginic acid etc. [8]–[11]. However most of them are unable to synthesize monodisperse colloidal suspension of AgNPs [12]. Hence, it would be interesting to develop a green process for production of biocompatible stable colloidalsuspension of silver nanoparticle with narrow particle size distribution using polysaccharide. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, production of polysaccharide using an osmotolerant marine bacterium and subsequent application of that polysaccharide for production of silver nanoparticle. Screening of several marine organisms for their capability of exopolysaccharide production has resulted in isolation of a novel osmotolerant polysaccharide producing strain of Alteromonas macleodii. The isolate was able to produce higher quantity of exopolysaccharide when lactose was used as carbon source. The EPS was characterized by using FT-IR spectroscopy. Further, purified EPS was used for the production of biogenic AgNPs. The nanoparticles formed were characterized using Uv-visible spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscopy and Dynamic light scattering.Materials and MethodsEthics Statement The samples were taken from Kochi back waters and Arabian Sea and not from a protected land or private property. Hence this does not require any permission for such activities and also does not come under “endangered or protected species”.Materials The media components like Zobell Marine Broth, glucose, maltose, sucrose, lactose were obtained from Hi-Media, Mumbai India. Ethanol and silver nitrate were obtained from Merck India.Isolation and cultivation of bacteria The strains were isolated from samples collected from Arabian Sea and Kochi back water, India. The samples were serially diluted and plated onto marine agar and incubated at 30°C for three days. Unique morphotypes were selected and were purified by subsequent streaking on ZoBell marine agar (ZMA) plates; the purity of the culture was confirmed by observing under phase contrast microscope and also by streaking.Screening of isolates for exopolysaccharide production and microbial characterization Selected bacterial cultures were further screened for EPS production. Inoculum was prepared by transferring bacterial colony grown on ZMA plates to 250 ml conical flask containing 50 ml of Zobell Marine Broth (ZMB) fortified with 5% glucose. Flasks were incubated for 48 hours in an orbital shaker (30°C, 200 rpm). The fermented broth was made cell free by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 minutes followed by microfiltration through 0.22 µ filter. Cold absolute ethanol was added to supernatant in ratio of 1∶2 (v/v) and kept at 4°C for 24 hours [13] for EPS precipitation. Precipitated EPS was further recovered by removing ethanol and then dried at 80°C overnight. Crude EPS was purified after dialysis by following the protocol described by Chakraborty et al. [14]. Biomass was measured in terms of optical density at 600 nm using corresponding media as blank. Productivity of EPS was expressed as grams of polymer produced per litre of fermentation broth per hour, whereas yield of the polysaccharide was defined as grams of polysaccharide produced per unit biomass.Morphological, physiological and biochemical characterization Colony morphology was studied by observing the strain grown on ZMA for 48 hours at 30°C. Cell morphology and motility were studied by observing actively growing cells under phase contrast microscope. Gram stain reaction was determined using Hi-MEDIA Gram staining kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. Physiological and biochemical characteristics were determined as described previously [15]. Biochemical and enzymatic characterization of the strain PA2 was performed using Vitek 2 GN kits (bioMerieux) with incubation at 30°C, according to the manufacturer's protocol.16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis DNA isolation, 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing were done as described previously [16]. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate was subjected to BLAST sequence similarity search [17] and EzTaxon [18] to identify the nearest related taxa. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of closely related type strains were downloaded from the NCBI database (http://WWW.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and aligned using clustal_W program of MEGA version 5.0 [19] and the alignment was corrected manually using BioEdit [20]. Pairwise distances were calculated using the algorithm of kimura-two-parameter [21]. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using the tree making algorithm neighbour-joining method using MEGA 5.0.Effect of different Carbon sources To investigate the effect of different carbon sources over the production of EPS, strain was grown in ZMB fortified with 5% (w/v) of glucose, lactose, maltose and sucrose in each flask. Fermentation was carried out for 96 hours and growth conditions were kept unchanged. After every 24 hours EPS and biomass (in terms of O.D at 600 nm) was measured. All the experiments were carried out in triplicates and averaged data was reported.Effect of different concentration of lactose on EPS production The lactose concentration was varied in the media from 5% (w/v) to 15% (w/v) keeping all other media components and parameters constant. Fermentation was carried out till 96 hours and samples were analysed after every 24 hour interval. EPS and biomass were measured according to the methods described earlier. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and average data were reported.Polysaccharide mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles In a typical experiment, synthesis of AgNPs was carried out by dissolving 0.05% of EPS into freshly prepared 9 mM aqueous solution of AgNO3 in the ratio of 1∶9 (v/v). The mixture was incubated at 30°C in the presence of light. Change in colour of the solution marked the formation of AgNPs. Samples were taken every two hour interval to study the AgNP formation.Characterization ofAgNPs Formation of silver nanoparticles were studied by UV-visible spectroscopy by measuring spectra in the range of 300–800 nm and simultaneously monitoring appearance of the characteristic plasmon resonance of silver nanoparticles using Hitachi double beam spectrophotometer. Further the AgNPs were characterized by studying morphology using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) in a JEOL 2100 TEM and the size distribution of nanoparticles was studied using dynamic light scattering technique as described earlier [22].FT-IR analysis of the exopolysaccharide and the nanoparticles formed FT-IR spectra of the EPS and AgNPs were measured using Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer. In each case sample for analysis was prepared by finely grinding the sample with potassium bromide. Overnight desiccation at 50°C of sample was done under low pressure to remove any moisture content in it. Spectra was recorded over potassium bromide pellets within a range of 4000–400 cm−1,16 scans with resolution of 2 cm−1 [23], [24].Results and DiscussionScreening, microbial Characterization and Phylogenetic analysis Ten cultures were selected on the basis of colony morphology and were screened for the production of EPS (Table 1).Among those 10 strains only one strain, designated as PA2, showed capability of exopolysaccharide production and was further selected for polyphasic taxonomic studies. Cells of the strain PA2 were found to be Gram-stain-negative, rod shaped, non-spore forming and strictly aerobic (Figure 1A). Biochemical and physiological characterization of the selected strain was carried out (Tables S1 and S2 in File S1). 16S rRNA gene sequencing was done for all the ten selected strains and their identity was determined carrying out sequence similarity search using EzTaxon [18]. Among the ten isolates two strains (PA1 and PA5) were related to Pseudoalteromonas prydzensis, two strains (PA2 and PA8) were close to Alteromonas macleodii, four strains (PA3, PA6, PA7, and PA9) were close to Vibrio spp., one strain (PA4) was close to Aesturaribacter aggregates (100%) and strain PA10 was close to Ferrimonasfuttsuensis (98.34%). Phylogenetic analysis of the strain PA2 based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that it was closely related to the genus Alteromonas of the family Alteromonadaceae and was having a pairwise sequence similarity of 99.7%. with phylogenetic neighbour Alteromonas macleodii (Figure 1B) and this novel strain was designated as Alteromonas macleodii PA2.10.1371/journal.pone.0098798.g001Figure 1Taxonomic characterization of the producing microbe.

However, substrates have significant influence on productivity in all fermentation processes and therefore, three different carbon sources (maltose, lactose, sucrose) along with glucose were selected to study the effect of carbon sources on EPS production by the selected strain. The results obtained indicated that productivity and yield of EPS was highest when lactose was used as carbon source and minimum in case of sucrose (Figure 2A). In the present study 18.7 gl−1 EPS was produced after 72 hours fermentation using a medium containing 50 gl−1 lactose with productivity of 6.23 gl−1day−1. This is significantly high as compared to earlier published report where productivity was only 2.4 gl−1day−1 [26]. Interestingly, glucose has supported maximum biomass growth where as it is least in case of lactose. This may be due to the fact that unlike lactose, glucose is readily assimilable and hence supported higher growth of the organism resulting in low production of the polysaccharide. It is also important to note Alteromonas macleodii PA 2 has capability of production of β-galactosidase enzyme (Table S1) and hence this strain can degrade lactose easily as compared to sucrose, the other disaccharide used as carbon source in present study. However, the expression of β-galactosidase enzyme is mostly regulated by feedback control mechanism [28] and depends on the concentration of “available” glucose present in the medium. These observations indicated that higher concentration of glucose will result in higher biomass growth and lower EPS production and on the other hand higher EPS production will be supported by a suboptimal concentration of glucose in the medium. Similar observation was also reported by Raugenes et al [26], where most of the EPS was produced during stationary phase, when the glucose concentration in the media got significantly depleted. Therefore, it may be commented that, that EPS is a product of secondary metabolism by A.macleodii and hence a critical concentration of glucose in the medium would promote production of EPS over biomass growth and lactose will be a better choice as carbon source than all other selected carbon sources for batch fermentation process for production of this polysaccharide.10.1371/journal.pone.0098798.g002Figure 2Fermentative production of exopolysaccharide. (A) Effect of different carbon sources on exopolysaccharide elaboration and biomass production by Alteromonas macleodii PA2. (B) Time course of exopolysaccharide production at different concentrations of lactose by Alteromonas macleodii PA2.Effect of different concentrations of lactose There are quite a large number of publications regarding fermentative production of marine exopolysaccharides in the literature [3], [5], [29], however, in all those cases maximally 5% sugar was used in the production media. Moreover, earlier reports on microbial polysaccharide production have shown that higher glucose concentrations have inhibitory effect on polysaccharide production by A. macleodii [27], [29]. On the contrary, for economically feasible production of polysaccharides, higher osmotolerance of the producing strain is very much desirable and one of the important criteria for the selection of organisms. Therefore, it was interesting to understand the effect of higher concentrations of lactose on EPS production by the selected strain. The lactose concentration was varied from 5% (w/v) to 15% (w/v) and results clearly indicated that the strain was able to grow and produce EPS at higher concentrations of lactose (Figure 2B). The growth of selected strain was found to be inhibited when 20% (w/v) lactose was used in media. EPS elaboration by the strain Alteromonas macleodii PA 2 has increased with increasing concentrations of lactose from 5% to 15% (w/v) and it was possible to obtain 23.4 gl−1 EPS after 72 hours of fermentation. This is almost 4 times higher as compared to earlier published report [26]. A comparative study of EPS elaboration, biomass production, productivity and yield after 72 hours of fermentation, showed that, higher lactose concentration has not only supported high EPS production but also it has resulted in higher productivity and yield of the polymer (Table 2). This may lead to development of economically feasible bioprocess for EPS production by Alteromonas macleodii PA2.10.1371/journal.pone.0098798.t002Table 2EPS elaboration and biomass production at variable concentrations of lactose at 72Alteromonas macleodii PA2.Lactose concentration (w/v)EPS (gl−1)O.D(600 nm)Productivity (gl−1day−1)EPS Yield (gl−1biomass−1)10%19.60±0.093.42±0.056.50±0.035.73±0.0512%20.40±0.073.55±0.056.80±0.025.74±0.0415%23.40±0.353.08±0.047.80±0.117.59±0.01Biosynthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles using purified EPS Addition of purified polymer to silver nitrate solution in the presence of light resulted in the production of silver nanoparticles when incubated at 30°C. Formation of silver nanoparticle was initially identified by the change in colour from colourless to brick red. Further, confirmation was carried out by measuring characteristic surface plasmon resonance peak of silver nanoparticles at 430 nm by UV-visible spectrophotometer (Fig. 3A).The results were similar when compared to earlier published report of dextran stabilized silver nanoparticles [30] which suggested the formation of colloidal stable suspension of silver nanoparticles by utilizing purified polysaccharide. It is important to mention here, that the formation of silver nanoparticle initiated after 2 hours of incubation which is comparatively faster than previous reports [12], [31]. Fig. 3A illustrates that, the absorption spectra reached a plateau after 8 hours of incubation, indicating complete formation of silver nanoparticles.Morphology of the synthesized AgNPs was further studied using Transmission electron microscopy.The TEM image elucidated formation of roughly spherical shaped silver nanoparticles with less than 50 nm sizes (Fig. 3B). The histogram indicated most of the particle was in the size range of 12 to 20 nm. In contrast when silver nanoparticle was characterized by DLS the average particle size appeared to be 87.7 nm after 2 hours of incubation reduced to 70 nm after 6 hours of incubation and then further stabilizedindicating that it was possible to obtain stable colloidal suspension of the silver nanoparticles (Fig. 4).During DLS measurement the size of nanoparticles seems to be larger in comparison to TEM imaging. This may be due to the fact that during DLS measurement overlapping of nanoparticles occurred which resulted in development of electrical double layer along with interference on charged particles [32]. Further, results obtained from DLS experiments indicated that the colloidal suspension of silver nanoparticles produced were having low poly dispersity index (PDI), where, PDI values were found to remain almost unchanged during the course of incubation. The PDI value of the silver nanoparticle solution was found to be 0.265 after 2 hours of incubation and it was 0.267 after six hours of incubation, suggesting narrow particle size distribution in the colloidal suspensions. This observation was similar to the observations made by Kaleret.al., where formation of monodisperse silver nanoparticle solutionswith a PDI of 0.34 was accomplished by Saccharomyces boulardii [33]. Although, most of the earlier literature on synthesis of silver nanoparticles using polysaccharides indicated formation of polydisperse solution of nanoparticles [12], however, in the present study it was possible to obtain colloidal suspension of silver nanoparticles having narrow particle size distribution with reasonably low PDI values suggesting that this EPS has a better reducing and stabilizing properties and may be successfully used for green synthesis of biocompatible silver nanoparticles.10.1371/journal.pone.0098798.g003Figure 3Biophysical characterization of the silver nanoparticle synthesized using the purified polysaccharide.

Scale bar corresponds to 50 nm.10.1371/journal.pone.0098798.g004Figure 4Histogram indicating size distribution by number (A) and intensity (B) of nanoparticles formed after 6 hrs of incubation.FT-IR analysis of the exopolysaccharide and the nanoparticles formed FT-IR spectrum of the EPS was analysed to understand the structure and presence of different functional groups in the polymer (Fig. 5A). The spectrum has revealed several characteristic peaks in the range of 3420 cm−1 to 800 cm−1. The strong absorption at 3420 cm−1 may be attributed to the stretching vibration of O-H group, whereas the absorption at 1673 cm−1 is assigned to the presence of carboxylic group. Absorption for aliphatic C-H bending was observed at 1404.69 cm−1. Characteristic absorption spectra in the range of 1500 cm−1 to 600 cm−1 confirmed that the molecule is a bacterial polysaccharide and is composed of sugar moieties connected with β-glycosidic linkages, as indicated by strong absorption at 856 cm−1 [26]. Where as in case of the FT-IR spectra of the silver nanoparticles formed (Fig. 5B), the absorption of the characteristic β-glycosidic linkages at 856 cm−1 was absent indicating probable involvement of this linkage towards formation of silver nanoparticle. Moreover, a new peak was observed in 1752 cm−1 which may be due to oxidation of the hydroxyl groups present in the EPS and simultaneous reduction of silver ions [31]. Minor shifts were observed in most of the absorption peaks, which indicate interaction between the polysaccharide and silver ions which has led to formation and stabilization of silver nanoparticles.10.1371/journal.pone.0098798.g005Figure 5FT-IR analysis to decipher mechanism of nanoparticle biosynthesis.

The present work emphasized on the possibility of using osmotolerantmarine bacterial strain for polysaccharide production and subsequent application of that polysaccharide for the production of silver nanoparticles. Screening of several marine strains has resulted in the isolation of a novel strain of Alteromonas macleodii. The strain was capable of producing 23.4 gl−1 exopolysaccharide when 15% (w/v) lactose was used as substrate, which is considerably higher than earlier reported marine microbial polysaccharides. More importantly, the purified polymer was found to act as reducing as well as stabilizing agent for production of stable suspension of spherical silver nanoparticles with 50 nm size. Therefore, the present work highlighted to the potential of the organism for commercial exploitation towards production of this polysaccharide and further use of the same for green synthesis of biogenic silver nanoparticles.Supporting InformationFile S1 File includes Tables S1 and S2.

In addition, the resolution of this biotyping is moderate and requires the manipulation of the living agent. More efficient DNA-based methods are needed, and this work explores the suitability of multiple locus variable number tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) for both typing and species identification. Eighty tandem repeat loci predicted to be polymorphic by genome sequence analysis of three available genome sequences were tested for polymorphism by genotyping 21 strains (18 reference strains representing the six 'classical' species and all biovars as well as 3 marine mammal strains currently recognized as members of two new species). The MLVA data efficiently cluster the strains as expected according to their species and biovar. For practical use, a subset of 15 loci preserving this clustering was selected and applied to the typing of 236 isolates. Using this MLVA-15 assay, the clusters generated correspond to the classical biotyping scheme of spp. The 15 markers have been divided into two groups, one comprising 8 user-friendly minisatellite markers with a good species identification capability (panel 1) and another complementary group of 7 microsatellite markers with higher discriminatory power (panel 2). The MLVA-15 assay can be applied to large collections of strains with automated or manual procedures, and can be proposed as a complement, or even a substitute, of classical biotyping methods. This is facilitated by the fact that MLVA is based on non-infectious material (DNA) whereas the biotyping procedure itself requires the manipulation of the living agent. The data produced can be queried on a dedicated MLVA web service site.

Brucella infections may result in significant economic losses due to abortion and slaughtering of infected animals. Humans are mainly infected through the consumption of contaminated dairy products or by direct contact with infected animals. In addition, certain Brucella spp have to be considered as potential biowarfare agents. Six species are currently recognized, B. abortus (8 biovars), B. melitensis (3 biovars), B. suis (5 biovars), B. ovis, B. canis and B. neotomae [1]. More recently, Brucella strains have been isolated from marine mammals [2], suggesting the existence of additional species [3,4]. The genus Brucella is highly homogeneous (more than 90% DNA/DNA homology [5]). Brucella classification is mainly based on differences in pathogenicity, host preferences, and conventional microbiological tests used for phenotyping (biotyping) [6]. Routine identification of Brucella species and biovars still relies on biotyping (reviewed in [7]). Only a few tools exist for further molecular subtyping, of which none has proven to be fully satisfactory for epidemiologic investigations or tracing back strains to their origin. Tandem repeat (TR) sequences may be an interesting class of markers, since multiple alleles can be present at a single locus, and size differences are easily resolved by electrophoresis (reviewed by [8,9]). Tandem repeats are often classified as microsatellites (repeat units up to 8 bp) and minisatellites [10,11]. Tandem repeat typing has proven to be highly appropriate for the typing of pathogenic bacterial species with a high genetic homogeneity, including the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Bacillus anthracis, and Yersinia pestis [12-15]. Recently, a family of tandem repeats located within a repeated sequence and present in multiple loci in the Brucella genome was used for strain typing [16,17]. The proposed set of eight microsatellite loci is extremely discriminant and highly efficient to distinguish strains within a local outbreak, but is unable to correctly predict the biovar or even the species of an isolate. A possible reason for that is the high mutation rate of these loci. Consequently, this MLVA assay cannot replace classical biotyping methods. The availability of the whole genome sequences of B. melitensis 16 M, B. suis 1330 and B. abortus strain 9–941 [18-20] greatly facilitates the search for polymorphic DNA sequences [21]. In this report, we evaluated most tandem repeats showing at least two alleles among the three sequenced strains [22]. Eighteen reference strains and 3 strains isolated from marine mammals [23] were typed using these TR candidates to evaluate their associated polymorphism. For routine typing, a subset of 15 markers which enabled to cluster the isolates according to their biotype was selected. This set of markers was further evaluated on a collection of 236 isolates representing the major biovars affecting terrestrial mammals (Table 1) to produce a first reference data set [see Additional file 1] which can be queried via the internet [21,24].ResultsEvaluation of tandem repeats polymorphism Comparison of the three genome sequences [21,22] identifies 107 TRs with a repeat unit larger than 5 bp and predicted to display size polymorphism. Eighty of them were evaluated for polymorphism among 21 reference and marine mammal strains (Table 1). Twenty-two TRs (numbered Bruce01 to Bruce22 in Table 2) have three predicted alleles. Twelve of the 22 are octamers, five of which have been previously characterized [16]. Typing was done by PCR using the set of primers listed in Table 2, as described [13]. Six markers failed to amplify DNA satisfactorily, and were not included in the further study: they generated multiple band profiles (bruce20-BRU329_8bp_148bp_7u; bruce38-BRU1116_18bp_108bp_2u; bruce71-BRU337_12bp_394bp_3u), or lacked amplification using the selected primers (bruce79-BRU163_12bp_141bp_4u), or no appropriate primers could be designed targeting the flanking regions because of the presence of repeated elements (bruce76-BRU243_21bp_2u; bruce77-BRU195_21bp_2u, not listed in Table 2). Three markers (bruce44-BRU256_12bp_110bp_3u; bruce65-BRU824_41bp_182bp_2u; bruce69-BRU488_57bp_181bp_1u) turned out to be monomorphic for the 21 reference strains. The results of the clustering analysis using the 71 remaining markers fits very well with the current knowledge of the degree of relationship between Brucella species [25] (Figure 1). We then looked for a subset of markers providing a similar discriminative power as the whole set for the collection of reference strains evaluated. Although extremely informative, the family of octamers, which includes the eight tandem repeats previously investigated [16,17], are not appropriate for species/biovar discrimination because of their hypervariability and more stable markers must be used. Among the other markers, a set of the ten most polymorphic loci clusters the different species as expected. Two of these ten markers display allele size ranges not appropriate for analysis on currently available automated DNA fragments sizing machines such as capillary electrophoresis sequencing machines (Bruce02 and Bruce15 have alleles up to 2 kb and 5 kb respectively). The amplification patterns of the 21 reference strains using the other eight TRs are shown in Figure 2. These 8 markers (Bruce06, 08, 11, 12, 42, 43, 45, 55) will subsequently be called MLVA typing panel 1. These are minisatellites loci with repeat units length above 9 bp [10]. In addition, 7 robust and highly polymorphic octamers (microsatellites) were selected to constitute MLVA typing panel 2. Panel 2 comprises Bruce04 (designated as TR6 in [16]), Bruce07, Bruce09 (TR8), Bruce16, Bruce18, Bruce21 and Bruce30 (TR2).Evaluation of a MLVA assay comprising 15 markers The set of 15 TR markers (panel 1 and 2, listed with one or two asterisk in Table 2) was used for typing a larger collection of biotyped isolates including various species and biovars [see Additional file 1]. Among the 257 strains, panel 1 alone resolves 51 genotypes. This panel does not distinguish B. suis biovar 4 and B. canis. All B. canis strains investigated share panel 1 genotype 2 with some of the B. suis biovar 4 strains (Figure 3). Similarly, most B. suis biovar 3 strains share panel 1 genotype 4 with B. suis biovar 1. Panel 2 alone discriminates 200 genotypes. However, the resulting clustering only approximately fits with the expected species and biovar assignment. When using panel 1 and panel 2 together (MLVA-15 assay), 204 genotypes can be differentiated. The clustering analysis is shown in Figure 3, 4 and 5. A number of major clusters weakly connected to each other can be identified: B. suis biovar 1 (Figure 3), B. suis biovar 2( Figure 3 and figure 4), B. abortus (2 clusters, Figure 4 and Figure 5), B. melitensis (3 clusters, figure 5), B. ovis (Figure 3). Brucella suis biovar 5, B. neotomae and the marine mammal strains are quite distinct from the closest strains (Figure 4). Brucella canis and B. suis biovar 4 are closely related and loosely connected to the B. suis biovar 1 cluster (Figure 3). The three B. melitensis clusters fit moderately with the biotyping results. Similarly, B. suis biovar 3 strains do not constitute a consistent group.Discussion The genus Brucella has been divided into species and biovars for a long time, but this classification has been discussed controversially since DNA-DNA hybridization has been applied. The genus proved to be highly monomorphic with a level of relatedness among all species higher than 90% [5]. This homogeneity complicated the development of molecular assays able to efficiently recognise the species-specific entities. This finding led to the proposal of a monospecies genus, i.e. B. melitensis. The classical species would be considered as biovars only. However, most bacteriologists did not accept this concept which has recently been rejected by the subcommittee of taxonomy [26]. The purpose of the present study was firstly to investigate the polymorphism of tandem repeat loci predicted to be polymorphic by comparing the data of the three different Brucella strains already sequenced and secondly to evaluate to which extend tandem repeat typing and classical biotyping clustering fit together. We evaluated most of these loci with a repeat unit of 5 bp or more. Polymorphism has been confirmed at 71 loci. DNA was amplified at every locus from all 21 reference strains, including the 3 marine mammal strains (except for Bruce04 in the B. melitensis bv 3 reference strain Ether and Bruce01 in the B.ovis reference strain BOW63/290) confirming the very high genetic homogeneity of the genus Brucella. A MLVA typing assay depends on the selection of markers which individually would not provide a relevant clustering. Taken separately, the TR markers are either not informative enough, or too variable or show a high level of homoplasy. However, the combination of well selected independent loci may be highly discriminatory and to some extend phylogenetically relevant, as shown previously for other species [9], and demonstrated here for Brucella. We propose a selection of 15 markers to be used in a Brucella MLVA assay consisting of two complementary panels, panel 1 (8 markers) and panel 2 (7 markers). The fifteen markers are a combination of moderately variable (minisatellites, panel 1) and highly discriminant (microsatellites, panel 2) loci (Table 2). The strain clustering achieved is consistent with well-established phenotypic and molecular characteristics (Figure 3, 4 and 5). The biovars 1, 2 and 4 of B. abortus are gathered in agreement with (i) the sensitivity to thionin and (ii) the PCR-RFLP pattern of the omp2a genes specific for these biovars [27]. B. abortus biovar 3 strains are found in a separate group except for 2 strains originated from Africa (BCCN 93-26 and the reference strain Tulya). Strains isolated in Africa often show distinct phenotypes [28] and thus, it is not surprising to find these two strains separated. The two strains do not require CO2 for growing. Their MLVA closest neighbours are two B. abortus biovar 6 strains also isolated in Africa. Assignment to biovar 3 or 6 reflects the H2S production which is the unique phenotypical criteria to differentiate these two biovars. The MLVA assay confirms that some African strains significantly differ from isolates of other origin and that B. abortus biovar 3 is a heterogeneous group. The B. melitensis group is very heterogeneous using either panel 1 or both panels (MLVA-15), and comprises four main subgroups. Biovar 2 and 3 strains are mixed in two groups, together with a few biovar 1 strains. The other biovar 1 isolates form 2 groups, one including the 16M reference strain, and the other (genotypes 173 and 174, Figure 5) comprising 3 isolates from the United Arab Emirates. B. melitensis BCCN 84-3 strain (MLVA-15 genotype 20) is an isolate from a dog in Costa Rica, which was biotyped as B. melitensis biovar 2, but appears to be distantly related to other B. melitensis strains. This strain is smooth as observed by the agglutination with anti-A serum, and the profile obtained in oxidative metabolism is typical of B. melitensis. Panel 1 analysis (not shown) does associate this strain with B. melitensis, but the full MLVA-15 analysis suggests a position closer to the B. canis group (Figure 3). B. suis strains are clearly differentiated in three groups (Figures 3 and 4). A first group includes all biovar 1, 3, and 4 strains, and a second group all biovar 2 strains. The two rare biovar 5 strains are very distantly related. The correlation with biovars is good with some interesting exceptions. The five B. suis biovar 3 isolates from Croatia have the same genotype (MLVA-15 genotype 36, Figure 3 [see Additional file 1]), and cluster with B. suis biovar 1 strains but not with the reference B. suis biovar 3 strain. More B. suis strains phenotypically identified as biovar 3 from other geographic origins are required. This may suggest that the biovar 3 phenotype may have appeared independently more than once. Biovar 1 and biovar 3 strains are distinguished by sensitivity to fuchsine and ability to produce H2S. Atypical fuchsine-resistant biovar 1 strains have already been described [6], as well as atypical fuchsine-sensitive B. melitensis strains [29,30]. So both the fuchsine sensitivity, and the H2S production (as suggested above for B. abortus) may appear to be phylogenetically weak markers with some degree of homoplasy. Among biovar 2, strains isolated from Spain and Portugal are related and can be distinguished from other European strains investigated. Biovar 4 strains can be found right beside B. canis. Meyer [31] has previously proposed a model for evolutionary derivation of Brucella organisms on the basis of phenotypic characteristics and proposed a close relationship between B. suis biovar 3/4, and B. canis. PCR-RFLP analyses of the porin genes are in agreement with this finding [27]. Three classical vaccine strains were included, Rev.1 (genotype 201), S19 (genotype 161) and RB51 (genotype 159). Six other isolates, from Israel, share genotype 201. These streptomycin resistant isolates were confirmed as Rev.1 vaccine strains using the previously described assay [32] (data not shown). This is not unexpected since vaccination is used in this country, and simply illustrates the stability of the MLVA assay in the present case. Strains clustering together frequently have a close or identical geographic origin, e.g. MLVA-15 genotype 16 comprises 2 B. ovis isolates, coming from the same region of France "Provence-Côte d'Azur" (departments 06 and 13). In almost all such instances where the MLVA genotype of two isolates is identical, the available epidemiological data is indeed compatible with a common source of infection. The rare exceptions would then suggest that some strains travel efficiently. MLVA-15 genotype 132 was observed in Germany in 1972 and in the centre of France (department 87) in 1994. MLVA-15 genotype 1 (B. canis) was observed in Greece and Germany. More epidemiological data will be needed in order to draw precise conclusions on the circulation of the strains. The MLVA-15 results support the current classification of the genus Brucella. In addition, differences found by phenotypic identification and/or by molecular studies are also detected by MLVA. One major advantage of MLVA is the ease of data exchanges. The data itself can be summarized by a very simple flat text file containing the repeat copy numbers for each locus and each strain. This data can also be made accessible and queried across the internet as shown [21,24]. Another advantage is that MLVA typing only depends on the measurement of DNA amplicon sizes, so that a number of electrophoretic techniques can be used, ranging from manual, low-cost, agarose gels, to high-throughput capillary electrophoresis sequencing machines. In the near future, it is tempting to speculate that international databases containing MLVA data of thousands of strains will be produced, and MLVA will become a routine assay for any new isolate. We believe that the MLVA-15 assay will be one step in this direction. A first use of the assay for a clinical application was recently described [33].MethodsBacterial strains The 257 strains and isolates used for MLVA typing are listed or described globally in Table 1. One hundred and seventeen B. suis, 43 B. melitensis, 52 B. abortus, 24 B. ovis, one B. neotomae, 17 B. canis and 3 strains isolated from marine mammals [2] were investigated. This collection includes the 18 classical reference strains representing the different species and biovars of Brucella. All strains were mainly isolated from animals and in a few cases from humans or unknown species (Figure 3, 4 and 5), and were identified by phenotypical tests based on agglutination with monospecific antisera (serotyping), phage typing, dye sensitivity, CO2 requirement and H2S production [6].Identification of variable number tandem repeats by genomic sequence comparison The methods previously described [10,12,21,22] and the genome sequence data for B. suis strain 1330, B. melitensis strain 16 M and B. abortus strain 9–941 [18-20] were used to identify TRs that may help to differentiate closely related genomes. The different TRs are designated by using the nomenclature previously described [13]. For instance BRU211_63bp_257bp_2u (bruce11) is a TR at position 211 kb in the B. melitensis 16 M genome. Its common laboratory name (alias name) is Bruce11. It has a 63 bp motif, and a total PCR product length of 257 bp in the B. melitensis 16 M strain when using the primer set indicated in Table 2. This allele size corresponds to 2 units.PCR amplification and genotyping Brucella DNA was prepared as previously described [27]. PCR amplification was performed in a total volume of 15 μl containing 1ng of DNA, 1× PCR Reaction Buffer, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Qbiogen, Illkirch, France), 200 μM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 0.3 μM of each flanking primer as described previously [15]. Amplifications were performed in a MJ Research PTC200 thermocycler. An initial denaturation step at 96°C for 5 minutes was followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 96°C for 30 s, primer annealing at 60°C for 30 s, and elongation at 70°C for 1 min. The final extension step was performed at 70°C for 5 min. Two to five microliters of the amplification product were loaded on a 3% standard agarose gel for analyzing tandem repeats with a unit length shorter than 10 bp and on a 2% standard agarose gel for all others, and run under a voltage of 8 V/cm until the bromophenol blue dye had reached the 20 cm position. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, visualized under UV light, and photographed (Vilber Lourmat, Marnes-la-Vallée, France). A 100-bp and a 20-bp ladder (EZ Load 100 pb or 20 bp PCR Molecular Ruler, Biorad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) were used as molecular size markers depending on the tandem repeat unit length. Gel images were managed using the Bionumerics software package (version 4.0, Applied-Maths, Belgium).Data analysis Band size estimates were converted to a number of units within a character dataset using Bionumerics version 4.0 (Applied-Maths, Belgium) [see Additional file 1]. Clustering analyses used the categorical coefficient and UPGMA (unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages). The use of the categorical parameter implies that the character states are considered unordered. The same weight is given to a large or a small number of differences in the number of repeats at each locus. Maximum parsimony was done using Bionumerics, running 200 bootstrap simulations and treating the data as categorical.Polymorphism index The Hunter Gaston diversity index [34] (HGDI) was used.Authors' contributions MG, IJ, SAD, KN, HN were in charge of strain selection, collection and checking of related data, preparation and provision of DNAs.

One impediment towards the effective treatment of cachexia is a validated classification system. 41 patients with resectable upper gastrointestinal (GI) or pancreatic cancer underwent characterisation for cachexia based on weight-loss (WL) and/or low muscularity (LM). Four diagnostic criteria were used >5%WL, >10%WL, LM, and LM+>2%WL. All patients underwent biopsy of the rectus muscle. Analysis included immunohistochemistry for fibre size and type, protein and nucleic acid concentration, Western blots for markers of autophagy, SMAD signalling, and inflammation. Compared with non-cachectic cancer patients, patients with LM or LM+>2%WL, mean muscle fibre diameter was reduced by about 25% (p = 0.02 and p = 0.001 respectively). No significant difference in fibre diameter was observed if patients had WL alone. Regardless of classification, there was no difference in fibre number or proportion of fibre type across all myosin heavy chain isoforms. Mean muscle protein content was reduced and the ratio of RNA/DNA decreased in patients with either >5%WL or LM+>2%WL. Compared with non-cachectic patients, SMAD3 protein levels were increased in patients with >5%WL (p = 0.022) and with >10%WL, beclin (p = 0.05) and ATG5 (p = 0.01) protein levels were increased. There were no differences in phospho-NFkB or phospho-STAT3 levels across any of the groups. Muscle fibre size, biochemical composition and pathway phenotype can vary according to whether the diagnostic criteria for cachexia are based on weight loss alone, a measure of low muscularity alone or a combination of the two. For intervention trials where the primary end-point is a change in muscle mass or function, use of combined diagnostic criteria may allow identification of a more homogeneous patient cohort, reduce the sample size required and enhance the time scale within which trials can be conducted.

Introduction Cancer cachexia has been defined recently as a multifactorial syndrome characterised by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment [1]. Cachexia affects the majority of patients with advanced cancer and is associated with a reduction in treatment tolerance, response to therapy, quality of life and duration of survival. Skeletal muscle loss appears to be the most significant event in cancer cachexia and is associated with a poor outcome [1], [2]. The international consensus on the classification of cancer cachexia suggested that diagnostic criteria should take into account not only that weight loss is a signal event of the cachectic process but that the initial reserve of the patient should also be considered (either low BMI or low level of muscularity). Although the latter concept has some validation in terms of clinical risk [2], there has been no evaluation of the biological correlates in terms of changes within skeletal muscle itself. Human skeletal muscle is composed of muscle fibres that are classified depending on their speed of contraction and predominant type of energy metabolism. Muscle fibres can be classified as type I (slow-twitch) and type II (fast-twitch) fibres based on their predominant myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform content. Generally, type I and type IIa fibres utilise oxidative phosphorylation, whereas type IIx and IIb fibres harness primarily anaerobic metabolism to generate ATP. Both the percentage and structural morphology of the fibre type will determine the phenotypic capacity and functional performance of any given muscle. Environmental factors in both health and disease have a direct impact leading to changes in fibre type/morphology and consequent functionality; such processes include aging, exercise, chronic disease, and cachexia [3]–[7]. The change, preservation or loss of fibres may influence clinical symptoms and there is some evidence that all types of MyHC is targeted selectively in cancer cachexia [8]. Ongoing loss of protein in muscle tissue may lead to muscle fibre shrinkage and a reduction in cross-sectional area (CSA). Equally, loss of muscle fibre CSA may lead to loss of aerobic capacity (VO2 max) in healthy subjects as well as cancer patients [5], [9]. Although systemic inflammation is generally thought to be an important upstream mediator of cancer cachexia [10], the precise molecular mechanisms that mediate the changes in protein synthesis and degradation that ultimately lead to atrophy of muscle fibres in cancer cachexia in humans are not known. For each animal model that has been studied, different pathways have been implicated. From such animal models there is a predominant impression that increased degradation via activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) is important [10]. In contrast, human data is very limited. Activation of protein degradation via the UPP has not been a consistent finding [11] [12]. This has led to suggestions that autophagy may be important or that pathways that may influence both synthesis and degradation may be important (e.g. TGF-β/SMAD signalling) [13]. In the present study we chose to evaluate the relationship between the different cachexia definitions, systemic inflammation (serum C-reactive protein) and potential inflammatory signalling pathways within muscle (phospho-STAT3 and phospho-NFkB). We also examined for potential associations between the various cachexia definitions and activation of autophagy pathways or TGF-β/SMAD signalling. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in muscle fibre biology with regards to morphological structure and composition, to study alteration in various pathways that may account for altered fibre size and relate these changes to the different diagnostic criteria that have been proposed as part of the recent international consensus on the classification of cancer cachexia [1].Materials and MethodsPatient Recruitment, Identification, Consent and Ethics Patients with resectable disease and suitable for the study were identified via the upper gastrointestinal cancer multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, UK. Written consent was given prior to entry into the study. All procedures were approved by the NHS Lothian local research ethics committee. The study conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki.Calculation of Weight Loss Pre-morbid weight was recalled by the patient and verified where possible from the medical notes. Although there may be recall bias, evidence to support the reliability of self-reported weight and weight history [14], [15] is well documented. Individual weight loss was calculated and expressed as percentage of pre-morbid body weight lost.Classification of Cancer Cachexia Weight loss >5% over past 6 months (in absence of simple starvation) (WL>5%) Weight loss >10% over past 6 months (in absence of simple starvation) (WL>10%) Stature adjusted skeletal muscle index consistent with low muscularity (LM) (see ‘CT-image analysis’ for cut-offs) Stature adjusted skeletal muscle index consistent with low muscularity and any degree of weight loss >2% (LM + >2%WL)Rectus Abdominis Muscle Biopsy and Storage For Biochemical Analysis All biopsies were taken at the start of open abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia. Patients had fasted overnight prior to surgery. The edge of the rectus abdominis was exposed and a 1 cm3 specimen removed using sharp dissection. The biopsy was cleaned of gross blood contamination. Obvious fat/fibrous tissue was removed prior to placement in a cryotube and being snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.Rectus Abdominis Muscle Sample Preparation for Cryo-Section A 0.1–0.5 cm3 section of muscle was cut. Liquid nitrogen was used to cool isopentane solvent in a tube to a temperature of ∼−190°C. The section of muscle was stitched onto a segment of cork. OCT solution was placed at the junction between the cork base and the muscle. This was then lowered with the cork uppermost (i.e. muscle first) into cooled solvent and held for approximately 5 minutes (until the muscle was frozen). Samples were then stored at −80°C until use.CT Image Analysis CT scans used for the analysis were done solely for routine cancer care. A transverse CT image from the third lumbar vertebrae (L3) was assessed for each scan date and tissue volumes estimated [16]. All CT images were analysed by a single trained observer. Cross-sectional area for muscle and adipose tissue was normalized for stature (cm2/m2). Estimates of whole body stores were generated from the raw data (cm2) using the regression equations by Mourtzakis et al. [17], which show a close correlation between muscle and fat areas in CT images at the third lumbar vertebrae and whole body compartments of fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) respectively.The respective indexes for FFM and FM (kg/m2) were calculated. Cutoffs for low muscularity were based on a CT-based sarcopenic obesity study of cancer patients by Prado et al. (i.e., L3 skeletal muscle index: ≤38.5 cm2/m2 for women and ≤52.4 cm2/m2 for men) [18]. CT scans used were routine diagnostic staging CT scans which were performed within 30 days of a diagnosis of cancer and all were in treatment naive patients. The median time to biopsy after the CT scan was 18 days.Immunohistochemistry The frozen muscle sections were co-stained for laminin (L9393, Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) and myosin heavy chain type I or IIa to distinguish each fibre type (BA-D5 for type I, SC-71 for type IIa). The paraffin sections were stained for phospho-STAT3 (D3A7, Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA, USA) with a Ventana discovery XT (Roche group, Tucson, USA). Images of the entire tissue section were acquired using a VS120 slide scanner (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The distribution of myosin heavy chain fibre types, the cross section area of the individual fibres in the section, and the phospho-STAT3 positive nuclei and staining density were analysed using the proprietary image analysis platform ASTORIA (Automated Stored Image Analysis) developed by Novartis/Preclinical Safety.Tissue Preparation for DNA, RNA and Protein Extractions Skeletal muscle tissue was minced and ground on dry ice. Aliquots were weighed using an analytical balance (Mettler Toledo) and stored at −80°C until use.DNA and RNA Extraction and Linearity of the Extraction Method DNA and RNA from human skeletal muscle tissue was extracted and purified with the automated Maxwell 16 system (Promega, Duebendorf, Switzerland). To determine the linearity of the extraction methods using the Maxwell 16 system, DNA and RNA was extracted from 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, and 10 mg of muscle, respectively. Calculating the total DNA and RNA content per wet weight (which in a linear extraction system should be equal for all aliquots), allowed us to define the linear range of the Maxwell 16 extraction system. Based on these preliminary studies, aliquots of 4–8 mg human skeletal muscle tissue were used for all subsequent DNA and RNA extractions. Using more starting material drastically reduced the total DNA and RNA content per wet weight (data not shown). For DNA extraction, the Maxwell 16 LEV Blood DNA Kit (Promega) was used with a slightly adapted protocol compared with the manual's instructions. Briefly, 300 µl of Tail Lysis Buffer from the kit ReliaPrep gDNA Tissue Miniprep System (Promega) was added to minced and ground human skeletal muscle tissue in Precellys 24 lysing kit tubes. Tissue was further homogenized using the high-throughput homogenizer Precellys 24, for 10 s. After cooling on ice for 5 minutes, 30 µl of the protein K and 5 µl of the 1-Thiolglycerol solution were added. This mixture was incubated at 56°C for 2 hrs. Afterwards, the lysate was transferred into well 1 of the LEV Blood DNA cartridge, and diluted with 300 µl nuclease-free water. For the elution, 50 µl of elution buffer was added into elution tubes. The Maxwell 16 instrument was started using the DNA Blood program. For RNA extraction, the Maxwell 16 LEV simplyRNA Tissue Kit was used (Promega), following the manual's instructions. Briefly, minced and ground human muscle tissue was incubated in 200 µl of chilled 1-Thioglycerol/Homogenization solution and further homogenized using the Precellys 24 system (see DNA). Afterwards, the samples were heated at 70°C for 2 min, then the lysates were allowed to cool down. 200 µl of lysis buffer was added to the cooled-down homogenate, mixed vigorously, followed by transfer of the total 400 µl into well 1 of the Maxwell 16 LEV cartridge. 5 µl of DNAse was added to well 4 of the cartridge and, 50 µl RNAse-free water was added to 0.5 ml Elution Tubes and the RNA extraction program was started at the Maxwell 16 instrument. Extracted DNA and RNA were measured spectrometrically using a Trinean DropSense Instrument (Trinean, Gentbrugge, Belgium) for quantity and quality.Protein Extractions To extract proteins, 300 µl of PhosphoSafe Extraction Reagent (Millipore) was added to a specific amount (between 8 and 18 mg) of homogenized human skeletal muscle tissue. To further homogenize the samples, the Precellys 24 system was used (see section above). After incubation on ice for 5 min, the lysates were spun at 800×g for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred into new tubes and spun for another 12 min at 1600×g at 4°C. Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) with BSA as a standard. Afterwards, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) was added and the samples were stored at −80°C until further use.Western Blots 20 µg of human skeletal muscle protein extracts (see above) in reducing Laemmli SDS sample buffer were boiled for 5 min at 95°C and then separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad, Cressier, Switzerland), blotted to Nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad), blocked for 1 h in 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline+0.05% Tween-20, incubated overnight with primary antibody, rinsed, and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1∶5000) (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany) at room temperature. Blots were developed using ECL (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) or SuperSignal West Femto substrate (Thermo Scientific, Wohlen, Switzerland) and exposed to Kodak film (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA). Rabbit monoclonal antibodies used were: Beclin-1 (clone D40C5), Atg5 (clone D1G9) , Atg7 (clone D12B11), Atg12 (clone D88H11), SMAD3 (clone C67H9), phospho-NFκB p65 (Ser536) (clone 93H1) and α-tubulin (clone 11H10) (all from Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA, USA), phospho-SMAD3 (Ser423/Ser425, clone EP823Y) (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies used were: Gelsolin (Cell Signaling Technologies). Western blots were analyzed densitometrically using ImageJ software version 1.45 (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij). Band intensity of each sample was normalised to that of α-tubulin.C - Reactive Protein (CRP) Serum CRP concentration was measured with an automated immunoturbidimetric assay by clinical chemistry department, Royal infirmary Edinburgh, using blood collected from patients at the time of recruitment and before any therapeutic intervention.Statistical Analysis Results are expressed as mean (± SEM). Comparisons between groups were performed using unpaired Student's t tests, whereas possible relationships were evaluated using Pearson's correlations. Results were considered significant if p values were less than 0.05. The program SPSS (version 20, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all the statistical tests.ResultsPatient Demographics A total of 41 cancer patients with resectable UGI or pancreatic cancer were recruited. In general, patients were over 65 years of age, predominantly male and had sustained, on average, 5% loss of weight compared with pre-illness levels (Table 1). Patients were grouped based upon the concepts of the International Classification Framework [1] according to weight loss or weight loss in association with low muscularity. The specific phenotypes considered were weight loss >5% (WL>5%), weight loss >10% (WL>10%), low muscularity (LM), and LM with weight loss >2% (LM+>2% WL). Although BMI was reduced in all groups classified as cachectic, only the LM and LM+>2% WL groups had a significantly lower fat free mass index (Table 1).10.1371/journal.pone.0083618.t001Table 1Demographic data of the patients involved in the study.All Patients (n = 41)Weight Stable (n = 23)Weight Loss >5% (n = 18)pWeight Stable (n = 30)Weight Loss >10% (n = 11)pNormal Muscularity (n = 9)Low Muscularity (n = 32)pNot Low Muscularity + >2% W/L (n = 24)Low Muscularity + >2% W/L (n = 17)pAge65±267±263±20.21665±266±20.84961±366±20.12865±266±20.727Sex (M∶F)30∶1119∶411∶723∶77∶44∶526∶619∶511∶6Pre Illness Weight (kg)83±383±481±40.74882±383±50.91286±781±30.48784±481±40.602Weight Loss (%)5±10±112±10.000*2±115±20.000*5±36±10.7522±111±10.000*BMI26±128±124±10.016*27±124±10.048*29±225±10.050*28±124±10.013*Body Fat (kg)17±118±216±10.41617±116±10.60916±317±10.76818±216±10.258Fat Free Mass Index (FFMI) (kg/m2)16±016±115±10.05716±115±10.14317±115±00.026*17±114±00.001*CRP (mg/L)14.5±516±812±50.66713±618±80.67015±914±60.96610±420±100.301 Data (except gender split) are presented as mean (SEM).  = cachexia group significantly different from the non-cachexia group, (p<0.05 by Student's t test). Abbreviations – CRP = C - reactive protein, BMI = Body Mass Index.Muscle Fibre Size, Number, and Type If patients were classified as cachectic by LM or LM + >2%WL, fibre size was reduced significantly (all types of myosin heavy chain fibre) when compared with non-cachectic patients and controls (Figure 1A). The association of cachexia with reduced fibre size was not observed if patients were classified according to WL alone. Representative immunohistological sections demonstrating differences in fibre diameter between a healthy control and an individual in Group II versus Group IV is shown in Figure 1B. Immunohistology for type I and IIa resulted in complementary staining in general, whereas fibre type IIb resulted in very low staining intensity as reported elsewhere [19]; therefore quantitative analysis was done only with type I and IIa but not with type IIb (Table 2). As would be expected from a decrease in fibre size, there was a trend across all groups for fibre density to increase in those with cachexia. However, due to large variability, this was not statistically significant. There was no evidence of selective fibre atrophy across any of the classification groups (Table 2).10.1371/journal.pone.0083618.g001Figure 1Fibre type cross sectional area (FCSA) according to different definitions of cachexia.

When compared with non-cachectic patients, muscle protein content was reduced significantly (approximately 13%) in patients with either >5% WL or LM + >2%WL (Figure 2A and table 3). However if the LM criteria were applied alone no difference in the protein content was observed. In addition, patients with >10% WL showed a 10% reduction in protein content when compared with non-cachectic patients but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Figure 2A and table 3).10.1371/journal.pone.0083618.g002Figure 2Variations in protein and nucleic acid content according to the different definitions of cancer cachexia.

RNA content was not significantly different in cachectic patients when compared with non-cachectic patients according to any of the diagnostic criteria (Figure 2B and table 3). In contrast, DNA content was increased by 50% with >5% WL but decreased by ∼40% in patients with LM (Figure 2C). The ratio of RNA/DNA was decreased (approximately 30%) in patients with >5% WL and LM + >2%WL (Figure 2D).Autophagy Pathways In patients with >10% WL, Beclin and ATG5 protein levels were increased significantly in cachectic patients when compared with non-cachectic patients (Figure 3).

Abbreviations – A.U = arbitrary units.DiscussionFibre Size The diagnostic criterion for cancer cachexia has long been based on weight loss alone [1] and can reflect loss in either fat or lean tissue compartments. Given that the key tissue loss in cancer cachexia is considered to be skeletal muscle, a recent consensus process suggested that the diagnostic criteria for cachexia should also take account of low baseline levels of muscularity [1]. In the present study, when patients were classified as cachectic or not according to ≥5% weight loss there was no significant difference in whole body muscularity (FFMI) or muscle fibre CSA. In contrast, when patients were classified according to low muscularity and ≥2% weight loss, FFMI was decreased and fibre cross sectional area was also significantly reduced (Figure 1). Such findings demonstrate that heterogeneity in relation to low muscularity and fibre atrophy may be reduced according to the clinical definition of cachexia. This finding may be important especially when considering inclusion criteria for clinical trials that aim to test the efficacy of drugs targeted at reversal of muscle wasting in cancer patients. The reduction in fibre size in all MyHC isoforms observed in the present study is consistent with previous animal [20] and human studies of cancer cachexia [4]–[7]. The rectus muscle of patients with oesophago-gastric cancer cachexia has been shown to lose all type MyHC content as well as undergo a reduction in fibre size [4]. Equally, in pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia, both type I and type II MyHC protein levels were decreased by 45% when compared with controls [6].Fibre Type In order to study differences in muscle fibre morphology and composition within the different cachexia categories, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of human muscle samples. For that, we first established and validated the staining methods for the myosin heavy chain antibodies specific for the different fibre types (I, IIa, and IIb). Staining for type I and IIa fibres resulted in strong specific staining specificity, however only weak staining was observed against type IIb MyHC, this finding has also been reported elsewhere [19]. The predominant types of MyHC fibre in rectus abdominis muscle are I and IIa and only <8% of type IIb positive fibres have previously been described [21]. Of the adult skeletal isoforms, each are expressed to varying degrees in both mouse and human skeletal muscle. However, although MyHCIIb is highly expressed at both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level in murine skeletal muscle, evidence to date suggests that this isoform is effectively only expressed at the mRNA level in a very small subset of specialised muscles in the adult human [22]. As mentioned above, MyHCIIb expression is typically associated with high forces of contraction combined with rapid contractile characteristics and it has been suggested that the contractile characteristics of MyHCIIb may be incompatible with the biomechanical constraints of larger muscles [23], which may account for the lack of specificity found in the rectus muscle of our patient population. In cachexia there is conflicting evidence as to whether there is selective loss of fibre type. There was no evidence for selective loss of fibre type in the present study (Table 2). Evidence from animal models suggests that Type II fibres are targeted selectively [24], with relative preservation of type I fibres in fasting [25], exposure to glucocorticoids [26], sepsis [27] and in the gastrocnemius muscle of the C26 model of cancer cachexia [28], [29]. Models of cardiac cachexia, however have suggested a trend to selective loss of type I fibres and an increase in type II fibre [30]. Furthermore, not all groups have demonstrated Type I and II fibre differences even in animals. Indeed in a recent study of the C26 cachectic mouse model, both glycolytic and oxidative fibres of (extensor digitorum longus) EDL muscle underwent wasting [20], whilst in a previous study using the same mouse model there was a significant increase in the amount of MyHCIIb and a significant decrease in the amount of type 1 MyHC in soleus muscle [31]. It is currently not entirely clear which type of fibres are affected in human cancer cachexia, however, in patients with oesophago-gastric cancer cachexia early loss of all MyHC isoforms has been reported [4]. The activity patterns of a muscle are also key in determining phenotype. If muscle cells are recruited infrequently they develop into fast/glycolytic units whereas if they are recruited more often, they form slow/oxidative units. In the C26 mouse model of cancer cachexia, there have been reports of switching of myosin isoforms in the soleus muscle of cachectic mice [31]. In pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia, no difference in the ratio of fast/slow myosin isoform was demonstrated compared with controls [6].Muscle RNA, DNA, and Protein Content In the present study, when compared with non-cachectic patients, muscle protein content was reduced significantly (approximately 13%) if patients were classified as cachectic by either >5% WL (p = 0.015) or LM + >2%WL (p = 0.035), and by 10% in patients with >10% WL. Protein content expressed in relation to wet weight of muscle has been shown to decrease progressively (in excess of 50%) in the gastrocnemius muscle of mice bearing the MAC-16 tumour [32]. This suggests that not only is there loss of fibre diameter, but that the quality of the fibre is altered with loss of either sarcoplasmic or myofibrillar protein. Such changes in fibre composition may contribute to the reduced muscle mechanical quality (force per unit cross-sectional area) observed in human cancer cachexia [33]. A reduction in both RNA content and activity in skeletal muscle has been attributed to a depression of protein synthesis in mice bearing the MAC16 tumour [32] . In the present study, RNA content was unaltered in cachectic patients (classified either with >5% WL or LM + >2% WL) compared with non-cachectic patients. A reduction in the RNA content in the muscle of mice bearing the Ehrlich ascites tumour has also been reported, but this occurred later than the observed depression in the rate of protein synthesis [34]. Whether muscle protein synthesis is depressed in human cancer cachexia remains to be resolved [10]. In a murine model of cancer cachexia DNA content of the gastrocnemius muscle has been shown to remain relatively constant, despite the finding of a decrease in protein and RNA content [32]. The current study demonstrated DNA content was increased by >50% with >5% WL but decreased by 40% in patients with LM (Figure 2C). Because mature myofibre nuclei are thought to be mitotically inactive, increased DNA content in skeletal muscle cells suggests activation of satellite cells [35] or infiltration by other cell types such as inflammatory cells or adipocytes. In the LM group, the decrease in DNA may be due to pre-existing age-related sarcopenia or other causes of muscle atrophy (e.g. immobilisation) and may relate to muscle specific apoptosis and reduction in cell number in keeping with a reduction in muscle mass on CT scanning. The diametrically opposite changes in muscle DNA content dependent on whether patients are classified according to weight-loss or low muscularity again underpin the potential diverse mechanisms whereby older cancer patients may develop a low level of muscularity. The issue of whether nuclear domain size is reduced in cancer cachexia remains to be resolved. In particular, whether apoptosis in skeletal muscle is increased in cancer cachexia and the degree to which DNA content is maintained or not via a compensatory increase in myonuclear number (possibly via satellite cell nuclei incorporation) is not known. Features of cachexia such as hypogonadism (resulting in low testosterone) or systemic inflammation (associated with high IL-6) could influence such regenerative capacity. In the current study RNA/DNA was altered in the cachectic patients (independent of definition) compared with the non- cachectic patients. This may be due to the interplay of the mechanisms described above.Mechanisms Skeletal muscle atrophy may occur as a result of decreased synthesis, increased degradation or both [36]. In mice bearing the MAC-16 adenocarcinoma, muscle loss is due to the combination of reduced synthesis and increased degradation [37]. Similarly Samuels et al demonstrated reduced protein synthesis and increased degradation in skeletal muscle co-incident with the onset of cachexia in mice implanted with the C26 murine model [38].Degradation Pathways The majority of signalling pathways contributing to muscle atrophy in pre-clinical models are mediated through activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway (UPP) [39]. The muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, MuRF-1 and MAFbx/atrogin-1 are up regulated in animal models of acute atrophy [40], [41], and MuRF1 selectively targets the myofibrillar protein myosin heavy chain resulting in muscle wasting [8]. However, the role of the E3 ligases in human cachexia is less well defined. In the current study we chose not to measure directly these pathways as results from our previous investigation on a similar cohort of patients found no up regulation using a transcriptomics approach [42], this has also been validated recently in a separate cohort of patients with gastric cancer [43]. In the present study autophagy proteins (ATG) 5, 7, 12, and beclin 1 were studied. These proteins are necessary for autophagy due to their role in autophagosome elongation [44]. When patients were classified according to >10% WL, Beclin and ATG5 protein levels were significantly increased in cachectic patients when compared with non-cachectic patients. In a previous study in a similar cohort of patients, the autophagy related genes GABRAPL1 and BNIP3 were increased in rectus muscle biopsies from cachectic versus non-cachectic patients [42]. In normal muscle, low-protein diets up-regulate autophagy that leads to the loss of muscle mass at least partially through lysosomal degradation [45]. Intriguingly, under other circumstances decreased autophagy can also lead to muscle atrophy.Systemic Inflammation Systemic inflammation is thought to be a major mediator of cancer cachexia [10]. However, the relationship between inflammation in the systemic compartment versus muscle and the relationship of either to muscle loss in humans is not clear. In the systemic compartment, Il-6 is thought to be a major mediator and may signal within target organs via STAT-3. Alternatively, both IL-1 and TNF alpha may signal via NF-kB. NF-kB regulation of muscle atrophy is predominantly executed by promoting proteasome-mediated degradation [46]. Activation of NF-kB has been detected in both physiological and pathological atrophic conditions such as denervation, unloading, aging, cancer, sepsis, diabetes, and such atrophy can be reversed by pharmacologic or genetic NF-kB inhibition [47]. In the present study although there was evidence for systemic inflammation in a proportion of patients, no significant difference was found in the levels of phospho-NFkB or phospho-STAT3 across any of the definitions of cachexia or in those with or without evidence of systemic inflammation. It is possible that inflammatory mediators have their main effects on muscle atrophy via central mechanisms mediated via the CNS [48].SMAD3 It has been suggested that binding of myostatin to the ActRIIB receptor results in the phosphorylation of two serine residues of SMAD2 or SMAD3. This leads to the assembly of SMAD2/3 with SMAD4 to the heterodimer that is able to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes [49]. One of the known downstream targets of SMAD signalling is MyoD, a transcriptional factor that is involved in skeletal muscle development and takes part in the repair of damaged skeletal muscle [50]. Moreover, SMAD signalling targets other genes such as myf5 and myogenin, known to be important for myogenesis [51]. Myostatin is upregulated in cachexia and in states of muscle paralysis [52]. Myostatin/ActRIIB activates SMAD2/3 signalling and importantly SMAD2/3 inhibition completely desensitises ActRIIB-induced muscle atrophy [13]. Inhibition of myostatin by a dominant negative ActRIIB promotes muscle hypertrophy independent of muscle satellite cell recruitment consistent with a direct signalling effect on muscle catabolism [13]. When patients were classified as cachectic according to >5% WL, SMAD3 protein levels were significantly increased in cachectic patients when compared with non-cachectic patients. Equally there was a similar (but not significant) increase in phospho-SMAD3 associated with >5% weight loss. It is not known whether such increased protein levels indicate increased pathway activity independent of any alteration in the ratio of phospho-SMAD3/SMAD3.Limitations of Study It is important to appreciate that the majority of patients in the present series will have had some degree of age-related sarcopenia, that this will necessarily co-exist with any cancer specific loss of skeletal muscle mass and that the diagnostic criteria used in the present study will not necessarily separate one from the other. The current study was not longitudinal and it was therefore not possible to document active muscle loss. It is also important to recognise that when patients were divided into different diagnostic categories the sample size in individual categories may have limited the ability to detect a statistical difference or not. This was an exploratory study and provides the basis for a larger study with adequate statistical power for definitive analysis.Conclusions In the present study, when the diagnostic criteria for cachexia included both a measure of low muscularity and weight loss, muscle fibre size, protein content and RNA/DNA content were all reduced. Such consistent findings were not observed when cachexia was diagnosed based on weight-loss or low muscularity alone. Whereas fibre type is not targeted selectively, muscle fibre size, biochemical composition and pathway phenotype can vary according to whether the criteria for cachexia include both a measure of low muscularity and weight loss. Such findings suggest that current diagnostic criteria identify groups of patients with different skeletal muscle phenotypes. Identification of a more homogeneous patient cohort for musculo-centric intervention trials may require use of combined criteria.

Samples of general practitioners (GPs) and endocrinologists in the US ( = 204) and the UK ( = 200) completed a discrete-choice experiment in which respondents chose between pairs of hypothetical type 2 diabetes treatments in a series of trade-off questions. The questions described hypothetical injectable treatments with differing levels of attributes, such as glucose control and treatment side effects. Relative importance of attributes was estimated by a multivariate regression model for limited dependent variables. These results were used to calculate how the predicted probability of choosing hypothetical type 2 diabetes treatments varies with changes in given attributes. The most important attributes to physicians were glucose control, risk of a fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and weight change. For US physicians, glucose control was about twice as important as gastrointestinal side effects, 5 times more important than changes in depression symptoms, and 20 times more important than liver monitoring. For UK physicians, reduction in MI risk was about 1.5 times more important than glucose control, 2.5 times more important than gastrointestinal side effects, and 10 times more important than liver-monitoring requirements. Preferences were similar among physicians in the US and the UK and among GPs and endocrinologists. Physicians valued type 2 diabetes treatments that go beyond glycemic control, although mitigating different complications and comorbidities was not equally as important.

Introduction Diabetes causes significant clinical and economic burden in the US and the UK [1–4]. Achieving effective glycemic control in patients with diabetes reduces microvascular complications, as well as long-term risks of macrovascular disease [5]. Even with glycemic control, complications and comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, depression, and obesity, have significant effects on both the clinical and economic burden of type 2 diabetes. In particular, patients with type 2 diabetes have two to four times higher risk of cardiovascular disease than adults without diabetes, which constitutes the largest share of the cost of diabetes [1, 5, 6]. Depression is at least twice as prevalent among individuals with diabetes as it is among non-diabetics, increasing the risk of diabetic complications [7, 8]. Finally, obese adults are much more likely to have diabetes than adults who are not obese [3]. About 13% of the expenditures on metabolic conditions (including the estimated annual costs of $92.6 billion on obesity in the US) are attributable to diabetes [3, 9, 10]. In addition, liver abnormalities are more prevalent among individuals with diabetes; thus, managing diabetes could be complicated by liver-related alterations in drug metabolism, drug interactions, and risk of hepatotoxicity [11]. An additional challenge is that almost one-third of diabetic patients do not adhere to their treatment regimen, leading to poorer glycemic control and increased risk of complications, hospitalizations, and death [12–14]. A recent review identified more frequent or complex dosing, treatment-related weight gain, persistent gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, and depression to be among the factors that impair adherence [15]. Diabetes outcomes are improved when management goes beyond glycemic control to managing comorbidities and complications [5], and such therapies have been a focus of research and clinical practice [16]. However, little is known about how prescribing physicians weigh the relative importance of glucose control, managing comorbidities and complications, and other treatment attributes that could affect adherence. The objective of this study was to quantify US and UK physicians’ preferences for extra-glycemic benefits of type 2 diabetes relative to other attributes of type 2 diabetes treatments. There are no type 2 diabetes treatments with proven depression benefits, and most treatments (with the exception of thiazolidinediones) do not require liver monitoring. Thus, the latter two outcomes are novel with respect to existing treatments, and this study is exploratory in terms of understanding preferences for these outcomes. A discrete-choice-experiment (DCE) survey provided data on physician respondents’ evaluations of pairs of hypothetical diabetes treatments. Treatment profiles described hypothetical injectable treatments with differing levels of treatment attributes. DCE is a valid and reliable survey technique for eliciting trade-offs to quantify the relative importance respondents assign to attributes and outcomes of health interventions [17, 18]. These methods increasingly are used to quantify preferences for treating diabetes and other health conditions [19–22].Materials and Methods A DCE is based on the principle that medical treatments are comprised of multiple characteristics. Physicians’ disposition to prescribe a treatment depends on the characteristics of both the treatment and the patient being treated. In a DCE, respondents make hypothetical prescribing decisions about constructed treatment alternatives. The researcher controls the features of the treatment alternatives and the patient characteristics; physicians’ patterns of choices are analyzed to estimate the implicit relative importance weights physicians use to identify preferred treatment alternatives [17, 23].Survey Development, Pretests, and Administration This study described hypothetical injectable type 2 diabetes treatments using seven treatment features (or attributes) based on published literature, consultation with clinical experts, and one-on-one interviews with physicians. The treatments of interest were non-insulin injectables used to treat patients who had failed to respond to two or three oral medications. The following criteria were used to identify attributes that: (a) were of potential therapeutic interest; (b) were clinically relevant; (c) reflected other, nonclinical features of concern to physicians; and/or (d) incorporated physicians’ assessments of patient concerns. The resulting attributes included: glucose control [treated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels], weight change, frequency of injection, GI side effects, requirement for liver monitoring, reduction in the 5-year risk of a fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and reduction in depression symptoms (Table 1).Table 1 Attributes and levels in type 2 diabetes treatments surveysTreatment attributeLevelGlucose control within 3 monthsReduces HbA1c to 7.0%Reduces HbA1c to 8.0%Reduces HbA1c to 8.3%Frequency of injections2 injections/day1 injection/day1 injection every other day1 injection/week1 injection/monthLiver monitoring testNot requiredEvery month for the first 3 months, then quarterly as long as the patient takes the medicineChange in body weight5% weight gainNo change5% weight loss10% weight loss20% weight lossMild to moderate nausea, diarrhea, and/or vomiting 3–4 times/weekNoneResolves after taking medicine for 2 weeksContinues as long as patient takes medicineChanges in the risk of a fatal MI over 5 yearsNo effectReduces 5-year risk of fatal MI by 5/1,000 (from 25/1,000 to 20/1,000)Reduces 5-year risk of fatal MI by 15/1,000 (from 25/1,000 to 10/1,000)Changes in depression symptomsNo reduction in symptomsFrom moderate to mild depressionFrom moderate to no depression HbA1c hemoglobin A1c, MI myocardial infarction The first section of the survey instrument obtained information on physicians’ characteristics and experience in treating patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as their target level of glucose control for a type 2 diabetes patient with the following characteristics: aged 45–65 years, obese class II (body mass index 35–40 kg/m2), sedentary lifestyle, moderate depression (a score of 15–19 on the Patient Health Questionnaire or a score of 14–18 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), failure to respond to two or three oral agents, and an HbA1c level of 9%. The second section provided physician respondents with definitions of the treatment attributes and levels. Levels are specific values for the treatment attributes. For example, weight change is an attribute, which may take on several possible levels such as 5% weight gain, 5% weight loss, or 10% weight loss. MI risks were presented as frequencies [24]. The third section included the trade-off questions that asked physicians to choose which of two hypothetical injectable treatment profiles they would recommend as the next line of treatment for the patient described (Fig. 1). All hypothetical treatments were injectables, because injectables often are the next line of treatment for patients with the target profile.Fig. 1 Example of a choice question for the patient profiled with a baseline HbA1c level of 9%. HbA1c hemoglobin A1c, MI myocardial infarction The draft survey instrument was pretested and refined based on in-depth, semistructured interviews conducted with 15 physicians in the US and 5 physicians in the UK. The objectives of the pretests were to test the understandability of the survey instrument, the appropriateness of descriptive information, and the cognitive burden of the trade-off questions. The US pretests were completed first. The final survey instrument for the US study was adapted for the UK, and the UK pretests were used to evaluate whether any cultural adaptations were necessary to facilitate comprehension of the survey concepts. As with the final sample, around half of the US pretest respondents were endocrinologists and the other half were primary care physicians, internists, or family practitioners. All UK pretest respondents were general practitioners (GPs). The sample in the UK had more experience, having been in practice at least 16 years, while the US sample had 1 to >25 years of experience. The UK sample treated fewer patients per week, on average, than the US sample. As described below, similar differences in experience and number of patients were observed in the full study sample. As a result of the pretest findings, the survey instrument was adapted to improve the descriptive information, and to reduce the cognitive burden of the trade-off questions. Statements were added regarding what the hypothetical treatments would be in addition to oral treatments, and that the treatment outcomes already accounted for potential interactions between glucose control, weight loss, and MI risk. The question about target HbA1c was added as physicians in the pretests reported various HbA1c targets. In addition, the glucose control attribute was changed from describing changes in HbA1c (e.g., “0.7% reduction”) to describing the level to which HbA1c was reduced. The GI side effects attribute was refined to describe the severity of symptoms, and a number of revisions to the patient profile were made, including adding the baseline level of HbA1c, narrowing the BMI range from 35–45 kg/m2 to 40–45 kg/m2, and dropping a second patient profile in which the patient had no depression. A number of minor editorial changes were also made based on the pretests, and the final survey instrument was programed for online administration. To create the stimuli used to construct the treatment profiles and pairs in the choice questions, we employed a D-efficient experimental design that resulted in 96 hypothetical treatment pairs [25–27]. Because the quality of responses to choice questions declines as the number of choice tasks increases, leading to fatigue or cognitive burden [28, 29], we divided the 96 paired comparisons in the experimental design into eight survey versions, each containing 12 choice questions. Each physician was randomly assigned to one of the eight versions of the experimental design, and the order of the choice questions was also randomized for each respondent.Sample Recruitment Physicians from an online opt-in physician panel were invited to complete the survey by e-mail. Physicians were recruited to the panel by phone, online, or face-to-face interviews with eligibility verified by a third party at their place of work. As an opt-in panel, some potential selection bias might exist, such as panel members being more interested in and/or more available for participation in survey research. Invitations to participate in the survey were sent to a random sample of panel members who met the sample inclusion criteria: (1) board-eligible or board-certified primary care physicians in the US or GPs in the UK or endocrinologists from either country, and (2) treat patients with type 2 diabetes regularly. The panel recruitment and study recruitment procedures were the same in the US and the UK. There are no power calculations for DCEs [30]. Most published conjoint analysis studies have a sample size between 100 and 300 respondents [18]. However, minimum sample size depends on a number of criteria, including the question format, the complexity of the choice task, the desired precision of the results, and the need to conduct subgroup analyses [30]. Given the results of a recent meta-regression [30], the research team’s previous experience, previously published studies [18], and an interest in estimating separate results for the UK and US samples, the study aimed to interview 200 respondents in each country. The Office of Research Protection and Ethics at Research Triangle Institute granted a consent exemption for this study, indicating that this research did not meet the definition of human (or animal) subjects research. US physicians received a $55 cash honorarium for participating in the survey. UK GPs received the equivalent of a $66 cash honorarium, while UK endocrinologists were given the equivalent of $75. The 25-minute online survey was administered in February 2012.Statistical Analysis The pattern of physicians’ responses to the choice questions was analyzed using a random-parameters logit (RPL) model. Results from the RPL model are log-odds estimates relative to the mean effect normalized at zero and represent the weighted effect of each treatment attribute level on respondents choosing a profile containing that attribute level. These estimates also can be interpreted as preference weights indicating the relative strength of preference for each attribute, and differences between preference weights indicate the relative strength of preference for changes among attribute levels in the study. The parameter estimates were combined with the treatment profiles in the experimental design to obtain a conjoint-utility index that indicated the average value score that physicians would assign to prescribing the treatment of interest to the target patient. The conjoint-utility index was used to examine how predicted choice probabilities (the likelihood that one treatment would be chosen over another treatment) would change in response to changes in a single medication attribute, other factors held constant.ResultsPhysician Sample Characteristics E-mail invitations to participate in the survey were sent to 691 physicians in the US and 1,915 physicians in the UK. Of these, 264 US physicians (38.2%) and 306 UK physicians (15.9%) responded. Of the physicians who responded, 204 (77.3%) in the US and 200 (65.4%) in the UK met the inclusion criteria and completed the survey. One respondent in each of the US and UK samples had no variation in their treatment-profile choices (always picked treatment A or treatment B). They were deleted from the sample as this lack of variation in response likely indicated that they did not pay attention to the choice questions. The final sample sizes used for analysis were therefore 203 physicians in the US and 199 in the UK. The characteristics of the respondents the US and UK samples are shown in Table 2. The average UK physician was younger and had not been in practice as long as the average US physician (P < 0.05). UK physicians treated fewer patients than US physicians (P < 0.05), and a larger percentage of the UK physicians selected higher target HbA1c levels for the patient profile (P < 0.01).Table 2 Summary of physicians’ characteristicsCharacteristicStatistic or categoryUS n = 203 n (%) UK n = 199 n (%) Percent of respondents who were women42 (20.7%)47 (23.6%)Mean respondent age in years (SD)*,a 52.5 (9.5)44.5 (8.2)Number of years in practice*,b Less than 1 year0 (0.0%)0 (0.0%)1–3 years3 (1.5%)0 (0.0%)4–6 years13 (6.4%)11 (5.5%)7–9 years11 (5.4%)12 (6.0%)10–15 years42 (20.7%)73 (36.7%)16–20 years40 (19.7%)46 (23.1%)21–25 years52 (25.6%)37 (18.6%)More than 25 years42 (20.7%)20 (10.1%)Type of practicec Office-based private practice (general practice)d 177 (87.2%)96 (48.2%)Hospital-based private practice (NHS hospital)23 (11.3%)108 (54.3%)Academic hospital-based practice (private practice)23 (11.3%)10 (5.0%)Other—not specified (other—not specified)3 (1.5%)0 (0.0%)Respondent’s area of specializationPrimary care (general practice)d 5 (2.5%)93 (46.7%)Family medicine (general medicine)43 (21.2%)11 (5.5%)Internal medicine (N/A)54 (26.6%)N/AEndocrinology (endocrinology/diabetology)100 (49.3%)95 (47.7%)Other (specialty not specified)1 (0.5%)0 (0.0%)Number of patients with type 2 diabetes treated each week*,b 5 patients or less3 (1.5%)4 (2.0%)6–10 patients7 (3.5%)13 (6.5%)11–20 patients20 (9.9%)45 (22.6%)21–30 patients44 (21.7%)41 (20.6%)31–40 patients21 (10.3%)32 (16.1%)41–50 patients38 (18.7%)34 (17.1%)51–75 patients38 (18.7%)19 (9.6%)76–100 patients22 (10.8%)7 (3.5%)More than 100 patients10 (4.9%)4 (2.0%)Target level of HbA1c for patient profile*,e 4.0%0 (0.0%)1 (0.5%)4.5%1 (0.5%)0 (0.0%)5.0%1 (0.5%)4 (2.0%)5.5%2 (1.0%)5 (2.5%)6.0%18 (8.9%)9 (4.5%)6.5%81 (39.9%)32 (16.1%)7.0%90 (44.3%)79 (39.7%)7.5%10 (4.9%)69 (34.7%) N/A not applicable, NHS National Health Service, SD standard deviation, UK United Kingdom, US United States * The difference between the characteristics in the US and UK samples was statistically significant (P < 0.01) aA two-tailed t test was used to test for differences in mean age of the respondents between countries bA Pearson’s Chi-squared test was used to test for differences in the patterns of responses in this categorical variable between countries cResults may sum to more than 100% because multiple responses were permitted dCategories in parentheses are used in the UK version of the instrument.

The estimated preference weights were generally consistent with the natural order of attribute levels (e.g., lower HbA1c levels were preferred to higher HbA1c levels). In three instances, the order of measured preference weights were inconsistent with the expected order of preference for the attribute levels: one injection per day was preferred to one injection every other day in the US sample; one injection per week was preferred to one injection every month in the US sample; and GI side effects that resolved after taking the medication for 2 weeks were preferred to no GI side effects in the UK sample. However, the differences between disordered preference weights were not statistically significant (P > 0.05).Fig. 2 Estimated physicians’ preference weights for attributes of type 2 diabetes treatments (95% CIs). CI confidence interval, GI gastrointestinal, HbA1c hemoglobin A1c, MI myocardial infarction The difference between the most-preferred and least-preferred level of an attribute indicates the overall relative importance of each attribute, conditional on the attributes and levels shown in the survey. The overall relative importance of all medication attributes except glucose control were similar across the US and UK samples (P > 0.05), indicating that physicians in the US and UK samples had similar preferences. However, glucose control was more important to US physicians than to UK physicians (P < 0.01). Although glucose control was the most important attribute for US physicians, the relative importance of this attribute was not significantly different from the importance of reducing the 5-year risk of experiencing a fatal MI, and change in body weight, which were the second and third most important attributes. For UK physicians in the sample, a reduction in the 5-year risk of experiencing a fatal MI was the most important attribute, followed by change in body weight and glucose control. For physicians in both countries, liver monitoring and changes in depression symptoms were the least important attributes of the medication. GPs and endocrinologists in both countries had similar preferences for treatment attributes. In the US, preference weights for treatment attributes were not significantly different between GPs and endocrinologists (P > 0.05). However, in the UK, GPs had significantly lower preference weights for liver monitoring requirements than for no liver monitoring requirements (P < 0.05), whereas endocrinologists did not distinguish between medications requiring liver monitoring and those that did not (P > 0.05). The overall relative importance of the remaining attributes was not significantly different between UK endocrinologists and GPs (P > 0.05). Figure 3 summarizes selected marginal choice probabilities. All marginal choice probabilities for the study are reported in an online Appendix. For example, if a treatment further improves HbA1c to 7.0% compared with 8.3% from a baseline level of 9%, the predicted choice probability for that treatment increases by 46 and 41 percentage points in the US and UK samples, respectively. If depression benefits improve from having no effect on moderate depression symptoms to eliminating moderate depression symptoms, the predicted choice probability increases by 15 and 12 percentage points in the US and UK samples, respectively.Fig. 3 Selected estimates of marginal choice probabilities for given improvements in medication attributesa,b. HbA1c hemoglobin A1c, GI gastrointestinal, MI myocardial infarction. aThe estimates implicitly assume that all attributes other than that being valued remain unchanged. b Brackets indicate 95% CIs. cThe patient profile indicated that the patient had a baseline HbA1c level of 9%. dThe marginal choice probability was not calculated for this change, because the estimated preferences for this sample were not consistent with the natural ordering of the medication feature The largest marginal choice probabilities in both the US and UK samples were associated with the largest changes in glucose control (from 8.3 to 7.0%), body weight (from 5% weight gain to 20% weight loss), and the 5-year risk of fatal MI (from 0 to 1.5%) (Fig. 3). In the US sample, the smallest positive marginal choice probability (4%) was associated with changes in liver monitoring requirements (from monitoring liver enzymes every month for the first 3 months, then quarterly as long as the patient takes the medicine, to no liver monitoring requirements). In the UK sample, the smallest positive marginal choice probability (2%) was associated with changes in depression symptoms. Larger changes in GI side effects (from continuing as long as patient takes medicine, to either resolving after 2 weeks, or no GI side effects) were more important than relatively small changes in efficacy (from an HbA1c of 8.3 to 8.0%). Also, avoiding a 5% weight gain was two to three times as important to physicians as a 5% weight loss (Fig. 3). That is, avoiding a 5% weight gain was predicted to increase the choice probability by 18 or 21 percentage points, depending on the sample, while a 5% weight loss would increase the choice probability by only 5 or 11 percentage points, on average. To assess whether preference differences were due to differences in age and experience between the US and UK physicians, interaction terms were added to the US and UK models. Respondents’ reported age and years of experience were interacted with each treatment-attribute variable. The significance of the all age interactions and all experience interactions were tested separately; neither set of interactions was found to be statistically significant. Given that the estimates for the age interaction terms and experience interaction terms represent adjustments to preference weights based on respondents’ age and years of experience, respectively, these results indicate that there was no statistically significant effect of age or experience on preferences for treatment attributes.Discussion US and UK physicians in our sample valued type 2 diabetes treatments that would go beyond glycemic control (i.e., HbA1c reduction) to help control diabetes complications and comorbidities. Physicians placed about as much overall importance on cardiovascular and weight benefits from diabetes treatments as they placed on glucose control. Physicians did not place much overall importance on depression benefits or on requirements for liver monitoring. We can only speculate about why physicians value some extra-glycemic benefits more than others. Physicians may place greater weight on familiar attributes than on attributes that are not present in currently marketed diabetes medications. Our survey-development activities indicated that the links between diabetes and both weight and cardiovascular outcomes were well documented in the literature and well understood by the physicians who participated in the pretests. However, the links between type 2 diabetes and depression are not as well documented, and pretest physicians varied in the extent to which they considered diabetes and depression to be correlated. Some physicians in the pretest also noted that there are numerous effective and inexpensive depression medications currently available, and one physician was concerned that combining treatments would limit the extent to which depression medications could be titrated. On average, physicians placed a low weight on liver monitoring requirements. Many of the pretest physicians noted that they test diabetes patients’ glucose levels frequently and can conduct a liver monitoring test using the blood drawn for that purpose without changing treatment practices. To our knowledge, there has been only one previously published study of physicians’ preferences for type 2 diabetes treatments. Porzsolt and colleagues [31] examined German physicians’ relative preferences for glucose control, side effects, convenience, and weight change. Our findings are consistent with their results, that weight change was as important to German physicians as glucose control. Larger changes in GI side effects were more important than relatively small (and less clinically meaningful) changes in efficacy, and about as important as changes in fatal MI risk and larger changes in weight loss. Many pretest physicians stated that GI side effects were key factors in treatment adherence and persistence. Physicians had a strong aversion to weight gain. This has been observed in other studies [32] and suggests that avoiding even a relatively small weight gain among patients like the one described in the survey is more important than a similarly small weight loss. The study was conducted in the US and the UK to explore physicians’ relative preferences for extra-glycemic control outcomes in two settings with different health care systems. Preferences for type 2 diabetes treatment outcomes generally were similar in the two samples. The three most important attributes in the US sample were glucose control, MI risk reduction, and weight change, though the importance differences were not statistically significant. The three most important attributes in the UK sample were the same, however, glucose control was less important than MI risk reduction (P < 0.05) while the importance differences for weight change and MI risk reduction were not statistically different. Glucose control was less important in the UK sample than in the US sample (P < 0.01). The reason for this is not clear from the study, though differences in experience and the health care systems could play a part. Physicians in the UK were younger, on average; had been practicing fewer years; and reported higher target HbA1c levels for the patient profiled in the survey than the US sample. However, regression analyses suggested that age and experience did not influence estimated preferences. It is possible that the differences are due to other differences in the study populations, perhaps related to different response rates in the US and the UK. The same processes and criteria were used to recruit physicians to the panel and to invite physicians to participate in the study, but there are potentially many other factors (e.g., holidays, professional conferences, other studies in same topic) that may have influenced enrollment differently between the two countries. However, we are not aware of any information indicating that other factors may have affected the response rates in this study. Finally, at the time of the survey, the American Diabetes Association standards of care [33] indicated that lowering HbA1c to <7% was a reasonable goal for many non-pregnant adults and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence’s (NICE) quality standard [34] defined clinical best practice as an HbA1c target between 6.5 and 7.5%. Further, the NICE quick reference guide for the management of type 2 diabetes suggests that target HbA1c levels be individualized, with less stringent targets (<7.5%) for patients on multiple therapies. The fact that guidelines in the UK permitted higher HbA1c targets could partially account for the fact that more UK physicians than US physicians selected higher HbA1c targets for the profiled patient. Based on the pretests, discussions with clinical experts, and reviews of publicly available information about treatment and referral guidelines, we hypothesized that there would be differences in preferences between endocrinologists on the one hand and all other specialties that treat diabetes on the other. While all of these specialties treat patients with type 2 diabetes, it appears that endocrinologists tend to see more advanced or acute cases (though there may be exceptions). The results indicated that the preferences of GPs and endocrinologists were similar in both the US and the UK, with the exception of differences in preference for liver monitoring among GPs and endocrinologists in the UK. Despite the increasing use of DCE in health applications to elicit preferences, this approach has several limitations. First, physician choices among hypothetical treatment profiles do not have the same clinical consequences as actual choices. We minimized the potential for hypothetical bias by offering treatments that mimic real-world trade-offs as closely as possible. Second, physicians’ actual medication choices may differ from predicted choices because actual choices depend on a number of clinical, institutional, and financial factors that were beyond the scope of this study. This study limited the characterization of hypothetical diabetes treatments to seven treatment attributes and excluded, for example, the risk of pancreatitis. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [35] and recent literature [36, 37] have highlighted controversies about the possible risks of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer associated with some diabetes treatments. Third, we cannot fully judge how representative our physician samples were or whether our results are generalizable to all physicians in the US and the UK. Fourth, the results we present relate to the patient profile that physicians were asked to consider. The sample was insufficient to explore physician preferences for different patient profiles. Finally, this study was not designed to support development of treatment guidelines or to provide clinical advice. The study also has a number of strengths from using best practices [17]. In particular, the survey was carefully designed in collaboration with clinical experts, was pretested using in-depth interviews with physicians in the US and the UK, and employed a state-of-the-art experimental design. The choice data were analyzed using advanced RPL methods that avoid estimation bias from unobserved variation in preferences across the sample and within-sample correlation in the choice sequence for each respondent. We also tested for the effect of systematic preference differences by age, experience, and medical specialty.Conclusion This study provides evidence that physicians place about as much importance on a type 2 diabetes medication’s cardiovascular and weight outcomes as they place on glucose control. We found broad consensus about treatment priorities among physicians with different personal and professional characteristics who treat diabetic patients. These findings are consistent with the challenges in diabetes care, in which cardiovascular disease and obesity continue to be problems. However, physicians place relatively low importance on the attributes describing depression benefits and liver monitoring requirements in this study. As the literature regarding the links between diabetes and depression and liver abnormalities matures, physicians and stakeholders should become better informed about these links and physicians’ relative preferences for type 2 diabetes treatments may change.

INTRODUCTION S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (MTases) transfer the methyl group from SAM to carbon, oxygen or nitrogen atoms of the target. Substrates for SAM-dependent MTases include DNA, RNA, proteins, polysaccharides, lipids or small molecules, implying their key importance in most biological processes (1,2) Methylation of DNA has crucial roles in DNA damage repair, regulation of expression and embryonic development (3). In prokaryotes, DNA MTases are part of restriction–modification systems, which protect the cells from viral invasion (4). Protein methylation is a post-translational process that typically occurs on arginine or lysine residues and is found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic signal transduction pathways, and a role in intracellular signaling has been identified (5). Recently, numerous RNA MTases have been discovered and their function studied (6). RNA plays a central role in the flow of biological information. Ribosomal RNA undergoes modifications by a number of enzymes during the maturation of ribosome. To date, over 100 different types of nucleotide modifications have been identified, out of which about one-third are present in rRNA (7). Of all species, rRNA modifications are the best characterized in Escherichia coli (7). There are three basic types of post-transcriptional modifications found in rRNA, namely base methylation, ribose methylation and pseudouridylation. Base methylation is the simplest and most common type of modification found in rRNA of prokaryotes. It occurs at the final stages of ribosome maturation and the rRNA sequences in which it occurs are highly conserved. Ribose methylation, occurring at the 2′ hydroxyl position on the sugar backbone, is more common in eukaryotes, and is less frequent in bacteria (8). rRNA MTases play a crucial role in the assembly, maturation and regulation of the protein synthetic cellular machinery (9). In spite of the wealth of literature on rRNA methylation, the structural information currently available for RNA MTases is insufficient to elucidate their mechanism of action. The structure of an rRNA MTase in complex with the substrate RNA is available only for the ternary complex of E. coli 23S rRNA m5U MTase RlmD (previously called RumA) with the ribosomal substrate and SAH (S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine) (10). RNA MTases are thus relatively less well-understood compared to DNA MTases, whose structure–function relationships are well established (4). As a continuation of our efforts to understand the structure and function of rRNA modifying enzymes, we have undertaken structure determination and functional analysis of E. coli RsmC that specifically methylates the N2 atom of G1207 in 16S rRNA. The modified residue m2G1207 occurs in a region of the rRNA that is involved in the recognition of peptide chain termination codons. In vivo, transversion mutants of G1207, namely C1207 and U1207, were shown to have dominant lethal phenotypes (11). Here we report the crystal structure of RsmC from E. coli refined at 2.1 Å resolution. RsmC is the first structurally characterized MTase, which exhibits the phenomenon reported earlier for many enzymes, including those involved in RNA modification: presence of duplicated, mutually homologous domains, which preserved the ancestral 3D fold, but accumulated divergent mutations in different regions, leading to the complementary loss of conserved motifs and selective retention of different aspects of function present in the ancestral non-duplicated enzyme. Thus, we combined computational and experimental analyses to identify the key amino acids involved in different functions and to assign the roles to the two domains of RsmC.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant DNA techniques The rsmC gene, cloned into pCA24N vector with a non-cleavable N-terminal His6 tag and corresponding strain with the knocked-out rsmC gene, were obtained as a gift from the ASKA recloned library [NBRP (NIG, Japan): E. coli]. Site-directed mutagenesis of the rsmC gene was performed by a PCR-based technique according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis strategy (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. NTD- and CTD-RsmC variants were constructed by recloning single domains into the pET28 vector by removing single domains in the PCR reaction. The mutant genes were sequenced and found to contain only the desired mutations.Expression and purification For the native protein, plasmid DNA carrying rsmC gene was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and grown in 1 l of LB media at 37°C till the OD600 reached 0.5–0.6. Induction of the culture was then carried out with 100 µM IPTG after cooling it down to room temperature. The cells were continuously grown overnight at 25°C in a shaking flask at 180 rpm. The next day, cells were harvested by centrifugation (9000 g for 30 min, 4°C) and pelleted. The cell pellet was first washed with pre-binding buffer (10 mM Na-Hepes pH 7.9, 0.17 M NaCl), and resuspended in 20 ml of binding buffer (20 mM Na–Hepes pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl), 5 mM imidazole (pH 7.0), 5%(v/v) glycerol, 10 mM BME, 0.5% (v/v) Triton-X-100 and 1 tablet of Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche diagnostics). The buffer conditions were slight modifications to the ones mentioned in an earlier work describing the purification, cloning and characterization of RsmC (33). For the selenomethionine (SelMet) substituted RsmC, the cells were grown in Le-Master medium (36), using the DL41 strain of E. coli (methionine auxotroph). The purification of RsmC was carried out at room temperature. Both native and SelMet RsmC were purified using the same two-step protocol: DEAE sepharose (Amersham biosciences) column followed by Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) purification. After binding the protein to the Ni-NTA resin for 30–40 min, the beads were washed with binding buffer (without Triton-X100). The protein was then eluted with 20 mM Na-Hepes pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM BME, 0.5 M imidazole, 5%(v/v) glycerol. Furthermore, RsmC was passed through a Superdex-200 gel filtration column using an AKTA-FPLC UPC-900 system (Amersham Biosciences). The gel filtration buffer was the same as the final protein storage buffer: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM BME, 10 mM MgCl2 and 5%(v/v) glycerol. The protein eluted as a monomer (∼40 kDa). The peak fractions were pooled together and concentrated to 4.5 mg/ml by ultra filtration, using a Centriprep centrifugal filter device from Millipore, with a molecular weight cut-off of 10 kDa.Purification and refolding of C-RsmC from inclusion bodies Inclusion bodies were collected from the cell extract by centrifugation at 20 000 rpm and resuspended in buffer B (10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) supplemented with 6 M urea. Dissolved pellet was then centrifuged, followed by addition of buffer B and Ni-NTA resin was equilibrated with buffer B. After 1 h incubation, Ni-NTA resin with the bound protein was washed three times with buffer B. The deletion mutant protein RsmC-CTD was eluted with elution buffer (10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) supplemented with 6 M urea. Refolding of the purified RsmC-CTD was achieved by sequential dialysis with reducing urea concentrations from 6 M to 4 M, 2 M, 1 M, 0 M against RF buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.8 400 mM l-arginine, 10% glycerol, 0.5% TritonX-100, 1 mM EDTA,1 mM DTT). The dialysis buffer was exchanged every 24 hours. The composition of the dialysis buffer (suitable for the subsequent ITC analyses) was 20 mM Na-Hepes pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5%(v/v) glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM BME.In vitro methylation assay 30S ribosomal subunits were isolated as described previously (37). Quantitation of subunits was determined by absorbance at 260 nm (1 A260 unit is equivalent to 34.5 pmol of 30S ribosomes). In vitro methylation reactions were carried out using 2 µg pure RsmC protein or its variants, 6 µM [methyl-14C]-SAM (52.8 mCi/mmol, NEN) and 3 µM 30S RNA ribosome subunit isolated from the rsmC_knockout (K.O.) strain in the total volume 60 µl of the buffer (50 mM PIPES [piperazine-N,N’-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)]-Na (pH 7.0), 4 mM MgCl2). After 60 min incubation at 37°C, methylation was stopped by heating the reaction mixture to 70°C for 10 min. The RNA was precipitated with 10% TCA onto Whatman GF/C filter disks. The disks were washed twice with 5% TCA, once with 5 ml ethanol and air-dried. The filter-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting.MALDI-TOF analysis The native and SelMet substituted RsmC was further analyzed for the incorporation of selenium on a Voyager-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) by comparing the experimentally measured molecular weight of the native protein with that of the SelMet protein.Dynamic light scattering (DLS) DLS measurements were performed at room temperature on a DynaPro (Protein Solutions) DLS instrument. The homogeneity of the protein samples was monitored during the various stages of concentration in order to avoid aggregation. The percentage of polydispersity was below 16% and the SOS error was less than 10 for all protein samples at various concentrations.Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) SAM was procured from MP biomedicals. For the titration experiments, the protein (both native and variants), was extensively dialyzed against a 500-fold excess volume of the buffer containing 20 mM Na-Hepes pH 7.0, 5%(v/v) glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM BME, for ∼14 h. SAM solutions were prepared by weight, in the same dialysis buffer. The ITC experiments were carried out using VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal, LLC) at 20°C using 0.02–0.06 mM of the protein in the sample cell and 1–2 mM of SAM in the injector. All samples were thoroughly degassed and then centrifuged to get rid of precipitates. Injection volumes of 4–5 µl per injection were used for the different experiments and for every experiment, the heat of dilution for each ligand was measured and subtracted from the calorimetric titration experimental runs for the protein. Consecutive injections were separated by at least 4 min to allow the peak to return to the baseline. The ITC data was analyzed using a single site fitting model using Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Corp.) software.Crystallization and data collection RsmC was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Initial crystals were obtained from a Jena Biosciences (Jena, Germany) screen and further optimized. The best crystals were obtained when a volume of 1 µl of reservoir solution containing 25% (w/v) PEG MME 5000, 0.1 M Tris–HCl pH 8.5, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate was mixed with 1 µl of protein (Hanging drop). Diffraction quality crystals formed in 3 days, with the smallest dimension measuring ∼0.14 mm. RsmC crystals belonged to the space group C2 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The cell parameters were a = 123.94, b = 51.50, c = 73.33, ß = 121.52. The Matthew's co-efficient was 2.49 Å3/Da and the solvent content 50.7% (38). The crystals were directly taken from the drop, and flash cooled in a N2 cold stream at 100°K. The native crystals diffracted up to 2.5 Å resolution using an R-axis 1V++ image plate detector mounted on a RU-H3RHB rotating anode generator (Rigaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Synchrotron data were collected at beam lines X12C and X29, NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory for the SelMet protein. A complete SAD dataset was collected (Table 1) using Quantum 4-CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp., Poway, CA, USA) to 2.1 Å resolution. Data were processed and scaled using the program HKL2000 (39). Table 1.

The N-terminal, as well as the C-terminal methionine, was disordered. The initial phases were further improved by density modification using Sharp (v 3.0.15) (41) that improved the overall figure of merit (FOM) to 0.73. The ARP/wARP (42) built ∼65% of the molecule. The remaining parts of the model were built manually using the program O (43). Further cycles of model building alternating with refinement using the program CNS (44) resulted in the final model, with an R-factor of 0.21 (Rfree = 0.26) to 2.1 Å resolution with no sigma cutoff used during refinement. The final model comprises 334 residues (Ala3-Met336) and 231 water molecules. The N-terminal His-tag and the linker residues were not visible in the electron density map. PROCHECK (13) analysis shows no residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. A simulated annealing Fo–Fc omit map of the putative SAM-binding site of RsmC is shown (Figure 1c).

The map is contoured at a level of 3.0σ. This figure was prepared using PyMol (www.pymol.org).Bioinformatics analyses Sequence searches were carried out with PSI-BLAST (45), and multiple sequence alignment was constructed with MUSCLE (46). Sequence conservation was calculated from the sequence alignment and mapped onto the protein structure using ConSurf (47). Structure manipulations and modeling was carried out with SwissPDBViewer and PyMol. Structure database searches and superpositions were done with DALI (16).Protein Data Bank accession code Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with RCSB Protein Data Bank with code 2PJD.RESULTSOverall structure The structure of RsmC from E. coli was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) (12) method from synchrotron data using SelMet-labeled protein and was refined to a final R-factor of 0.21 (Rfree = 0.26%) at 2.1 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit contains one RsmC molecule comprising 334 residues from Ala3 to Met336 and a total of 232 water molecules. Neither the N-terminal His-tag nor the C-terminal residues Thr337-Gly343 had interpretable density and were not modeled. The RsmC molecules eluted as a monomer from the gel filtration column. This was consistent with observations in the dynamic light scattering experiments as well as the analysis of intermolecular contacts in the crystal (data not shown). Analysis of the Ramachandran plot using the program PROCHECK (13) showed 88.6% of all residues within the most favored regions and no residues in the disallowed regions. The crystallographic statistics are given in Table 1. The structure of the full-length RsmC with overall dimensions of ∼35 × 40 × 60 Å reveals the presence of two homologous domains of a mixed α/β fold, characteristic for SAM-dependent MTases (Figure 1 ribbon diagram). The existence of intramolecular homology in RsmC has been earlier predicted by bioinformatics analysis (14). The N-terminal domain (NTD) consists of seven β-strands and five α-helices and the C-terminal domain (CTD) has nine β-strands and six α-helices. The NPPF (N269-F271) tetrapeptide motif, which is conserved in m2G MTases (15) is located in a loop between β4 and α5 of the CTD (Figure 2). This motif is absent from the NTD. Figure 2. Structure-based sequence alignment of two domains of RsmC, RlmG, together with their closest homolog MJ0882 (1dus). The superposition of RsmC-NTD, RsmC-CTD and MJ0882 was performed with O program (43). For RsmC and RlmG families three representative members are shown: E. coli (Ec), P. aeruginosa (Pa) and V. cholerae (Vc). For MJ0882, homologs are from B. subtilis (Bs) and T. maritima (Tm). Residues that are conserved within families are highlighted. For EcRsmC, the sequence ruler and the secondary structural elements are shown in the upper panel. Common motifs (conservation at the 3D level) are indicated below the alignment and conserved regions of functional importance (RNA-binding in the NTD and SAM-binding and catalysis in the CTD) are boxed. The DALI search (16) shows that there is no structure in the PDB with global similarity to the entire RsmC. However, the isolated NTD and CTD show expected similarity to SAM-dependant MTases from the RFM superfamily (17) as well as to each other. In particular, the NTD shows higher similarity to the CTD than to any other structure: RMSD 2.4 Å for 135 Cα atoms, DALI Z-score of 13.1. As predicted by bioinformatics analyses (14), among other proteins of known structure, MJ0882, a putative MTase from Methanococcus jannaschii (PDB code 1dus) is the closest homolog of both NTD and CTD: it superimposes onto the NTD with 2.5 Å RMSD over 138 Cα atoms, DALI Z-score of 13.1 and onto the CTD with RMSD 2.0 Å over 173 Cα atoms, DALI Z-score of 23.3. Other MTases from the large RFM superfamily show significant, but lower structural similarity (data not shown). Although the structures of the NTD and CTD of RsmC are highly similar to each other, the structure-based sequence alignment of the two domains indicates that there is only 12% amino acid identity between them (Figure 2). Clearly noticeable is the preservation of a non-polar character of the residues forming the ß-sheet core of both domains and the lack of conservation of residues at the surface. These features suggest that both domains of RsmC originated by intragenic tandem duplication from a primitive single-domain ancestor similar to MJ0882, and that they accumulated divergent mutations that made them dissimilar on the surface, while preserving the structural scaffold. It is important to note that the NTD appears to have accumulated more sequence and structural changes than the CTD with respect to MJ0882: while the CTD exhibits 22.7% amino acid sequence identity to MJ0882, the NTD shows 11.4% identity both to the CTD and to MJ0882 (see also the aforementioned DALI Z-scores, 23.3 versus 13.1).Bioinformatics analyses Although the sequence analysis of RsmC had been reported (14), thus far no high-resolution structure was available to provide a 3D framework for sequence-function considerations. Both domains of RsmC are members of the RFM superfamily of MTases, which is characterized by the presence of a series of motifs conserved at the structural level, and typically also at the sequence level (17). Motifs I, II and III form a SAM-binding pocket, while motifs X and IV usually form the ‘floor’ and the ‘roof’ of the catalytic site and may be important for the methyl group donor SAM and substrate binding, positioning them in optimal orientation for the methyl group transfer to occur. Motif VI often participates in the formation of the active site from the substrate side, motifs V and VII are typically important for the structural stability and motif VIII can participate in substrate binding. On the sequence level, motif I is strongly conserved among nearly all members of the RFM superfamily and typically assumes the pattern similar to (D/E)XGXGXG. Motif IV typically contains the key substrate-binding and/or catalytic residues and assumes very different sequence patterns in MTase families acting on different molecules. In MTases acting on exocyclic amino groups of nucleic acid bases (those yielding m6A, m4C and m2G modifications), the typical pattern of conservation is (N/D/S)PP(Y/F/W/H) (15). To identify the potential functionally important sites in both domains of RsmC, we calculated the sequence conservation in the RsmC family and mapped it onto the protein surface. This analysis reveals two conserved patches: the larger one lining up a deep pocket in the CTD formed by motifs: X, I, II, III, IV and VI, and the smaller one on the exposed protuberance of the NTD formed by motifs VII and VIII. Importantly, the conservation is asymmetric across the domains—neither the NTD pocket nor the CTD protuberance shows any significant conservation (Figure 3A). On the other hand, mapping of the electrostatic potential on the surface of RsmC reveals that the protein is almost uniformly negatively charged with the exception of a small positive patch on the conserved NTD protuberance (Figure 3B). We carried out analogous analyses for a comparative model of RlmG (YgjO), a MTase closely related to RsmC and also exhibiting two domains, but specific for m2G modification at the G1835 another position of 23S rRNA (18). The distribution of conservation in the RlmG family is similar to that in the RsmC family, with high conservation in the CTD pocket and on the NTD protuberance (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1). Interestingly, while the CTD pocket is conserved between RsmC and RlmG, the NTD protuberance is not, i.e. motifs VII and VIII in both families exhibit different conserved amino acids (Figure 2). RlmG is also negatively charged, with positive patches on both NTD and CTD protuberances (Supplementary Figure 2). Conservation of the pocket with motifs I and IV suggest that the CTD of RsmC and RlmG is important for binding of the SAM cofactor and the catalysis of the methyl transfer reaction. On the other hand, a positively charged protuberance that shows differential conservation in MTase families of different specificity is likely to be important for the recognition and binding of their different rRNA substrates. This prediction is further supported by bioinformatics methods for prediction of RNA-binding sites RNABindR (19) and BindN (20) that identify region 130–145 (encompassing motif VIII in the NTD) as a likely RNA-binding site (data not shown). Figure 3. (A) Amino acid sequence conservation in the RsmC family mapped onto the RsmC surface using ConSurf (from red: no conservation, to blue: identity). (B) Electrostatic potential mapped onto the RsmC surface (from red −5 kT to blue, +5 kT): showing the positively charged protuberance in the NTD and the dominantly negatively charged CTD (left and right, respectively) separated by a cleft.

Ligands were docked manually, to visualize the active site, in analogy to other MTase structures. (D) A detailed view of the predicted ligand-binding/active site pocket in RsmC. Atoms of docked ligands and predicted ligand-binding residues are colored using the following scheme: C, gray; O, red; N, blue; S (in SAM) and P (in guanosine), yellow. The figures were produced with SwissPDBViewer.Structure–function relationships in RsmC To characterize the function of each domain of RsmC and to confirm the predicted role of individual residues, we designed and constructed two deletion mutants corresponding to the isolated NTD and CTD (amino acids 1–158 and 159–336, respectively), and a series of point mutants of conserved residues in the full-length RsmC that mapped to the predicted SAM-binding site, guanosine-binding/catalytic site and the RNA-binding site. For the potential RNA-binding site we constructed three double mutants in the neighboring positively charged residues (Figure 3C). The NTD as well as the point mutants expressed and purified easily using procedure optimized for the wild-type protein, while the isolated CTD turned out to be very difficult to purify in these conditions and only the purification and refolding from inclusion bodies enabled us to obtain sufficient amounts of the deletion mutant protein for further experiments. It is known that a maltose-binding protein (MBP) can act as a ‘passive chaperone’ to improve the solubility and promote the proper folding of their fusion partners (21). Thus, we constructed two variants of the RsmC CTD, fused to the MBP either in the N- or C-terminus of the isolated domain (i.e. MBP–CTD or CTD–MBP). We found that the MBP–CTD fusion protein purifies well, similar to the wild-type RsmC (NTD–CTD), while the CTD–MBP fusion protein purifies poorly, similar to the isolated CTD (data not shown). In the MBP–CTD fusion, the MBP domain physically replaces the NTD of the wt RsmC and has the opportunity to fold before the CTD, as it leaves the ribosome earlier. On the other hand, in the CTD–MBP fusion CTD leaves the ribosome first, and it is likely that it starts to fold before it has a chance to interact with the MBP domain. Our results suggest that the RsmC CTD has lost the ability to fold on its own and requires a pre-folded ‘intramolecular chaperone’ localized at its N-terminus, be it the NTD or another well-folded domain such as MBP. In order to characterize the function of individual residues, we carried out the functional, biochemical and biophysical characterization of the point mutants. The biochemical assay involving the in vitro methylation of ribosomes isolated from the rsmC▵ strain (see ‘Materials and methods’ section for details) revealed that all mutant proteins exhibit reduced activities compared to the wild-type RsmC (Figure 4). In particular, alanine substitution of residues predicted to be important for SAM binding showed the most severe loss of activity (D202A in motif I to 4% and D227A in motif II to 13%). The alanine substitution of the Asn residue in the predicted catalytic NPPF motif IV (N268A) has reduced the activity to 20% of the wild-type. On the other hand, substitutions of individual residues in the predicted RNA-binding site had relatively mild effects on the RsmC activity—their activity was typically reduced only to 30–50% of the wt enzyme (Figure 4). Double mutants exhibited further reduction of activity, e.g. K86S/K88S to 16%. These results are very similar to those obtained in the course of mutagenesis of the rRNA:m6A methyltransferase ErmC’ (22), where it was also impossible to obtain a mutant that would be completely inactive in vitro even with multiple substitutions in the predicted RNA-binding site. Figure 4. In vitro MTase activity of the mutant RsmC variants, measured on the 30S RNA ribosome subunits isolated from the rsmC K.O. strain. The activity is shown as the percentage of the wild-type MTase activity. Double and single substitutions in the presumed RNA-binding site are indicated in gray, substitutions in the SAM-binding site are indicated in black, and the substitution in the active site is indicated in white. The interactions between RsmC (and its mutant variants) and the methyl group donor SAM were studied by the Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. The thermodynamics of binding is given in Table 2. The mutants D202A and D227A in the potential SAM-binding site in the CTD showed complete inability to bind the cofactor (Figure 5), while the N268A mutant in the predicted catalytic motif NPPF that coordinates interactions between SAM and the target guanosine showed almost 5-fold reduction in the SAM-binding affinity (Supplementary Figure 1 and Table 2). On the other hand, mutants in the predicted RNA-binding site in the NTD could still bind SAM with wild-type-like affinities (Table 2) indicating that their reduced activity is not due to the compromised cofactor binding. Figure 5. ITC spectra for RsmC wild type and mutants. Baseline subtracted raw ITC data for injections of SAM (ligand) is indicated in the upper panels of each of the ITC profiles shown (for the wild-type as well as the variants of RsmC). The peaks normalized to the ligand/protein molar ratio were integrated as is shown in the bottom panels. The solid dots indicate the experimental data and the best fit to the experimental data were obtained from a non-linear least squares method of fitting using a one-site binding model depicted by a solid line.

ΔH, ΔS, ΔG—change in enthalpy, entropy and Gibb's free energy, respectively. ITC experiments on the NTD of RsmC with SAM indicated that this domain is not capable of binding SAM (Supplementary Figure 1). We failed to obtain a preparation of the isolated CTD (with MBP cleaved off) that would be suitable for ITC measurements. Interestingly, the entire MBP–CTD fusion protein that could be purified, was unable to bind SAM, which indicates one of the three possibilities (i) the CTD is misfolded (despite the presence of MBP) or (ii) some portion of MBP blocks the access to the SAM-binding site on a properly folded CTD or (iii) SAM binding by RsmC requires the presence of both NTD and CTD. Our crystal-structure-based docking model suggests that the NTD does not make direct contacts with SAM. Thus, based on our analysis of the calorimetric studies on the wild type RsmC and point mutants in the CTD that are incapable of SAM binding, we propose that the NTD has evolved to be an essential intramolecular chaperone of the CTD that promotes the formation of the SAM-binding site. The presented data allows us to conclude that the CTD of RsmC is involved in SAM binding and catalysis of the N2-guanosine methylation reaction, while the NTD is important for the folding of CTD and contains residues that are important (but not essential) for the RNA MTase activity, not by direct involvement in cofactor binding, but most likely by RNA binding. We were unable to measure the binding of RsmC and its variants to the ribosome; however the analysis of protein structure and sequence conservation strongly suggests that the NTD is the principal substrate-recognition and binding module of the RsmC. Thus, despite the homology between NTD and CTD they appear to perform completely different and complementary roles.DISCUSSION Domain duplication and functional specialization is a common evolutionary process. The duplication of a gene encoding a primitive multifunctional protein yields two independent proteins or one protein with two similar domains, which may experience relaxation of functional constraints and increased rate of mutations [review: (23)]. A number of primitive homooligomeric enzymes have been reported to possess heterooligomeric counterparts with specialized subunits, the best known example being probably the proteasome [review: (24)]. Among enzymes involved in RNA metabolism, the most frequent specialization in enzymes composed of two or more homologous domains concerns substrate-binding, catalysis or structural stability, accompanied by the degeneration of ancestral activities. Examples include heterodimeric tRNA deaminases (25) and heterotetrameric tRNA:m1A58 MTases (26,27). Similar mechanisms have been postulated for other MTases, including the protein-modifying enzyme PRMT7 comprising two domains in the single polypeptide (28) and eukaryotic DNA MTases Dnmt3a/Dnmt3b/Dnmt3L, where the ‘degenerated’ Dnmt3L is a regulatory subunit in the heterodimeric complex with Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b (29,30). However, thus far no structural information existed to analyze this phenomenon in detail. The structure of RsmC provides the first atomic-level picture of an RNA-modification enzyme as well as of an MTase which comprises two domains apparently derived from a common ancestor, which underwent differential functional specialization. According to ITC measurements, RsmC binds only one SAM molecule, and mutational analyses clearly demonstrate that conserved residues in the CTD are responsible for SAM binding. The direct involvement of the NTD in rRNA binding remains to be established, nonetheless mutational analyses of residues in the conserved charged patch on the NTD surface, predicted to be involved in RNA binding by the RNABindR and BindN methods, give strong support for this prediction. Substitutions of these residues significantly affected the MTase activity, while they had no effect on the SAM-binding ability of the enzyme. Despite the conservation of the structural ‘MTase-like’ scaffold, two RFM domains of RsmC exhibit complementary pattern of sequence loss or conservation in motifs implicated in substrate-binding (NTD) versus cofactor-binding and catalysis (CTD). Not surprisingly, the isolated domains are unable to carry out the methylation reaction. Moreover, even when the two isolated domains of RsmC are mixed together, they fail to form a catalytically active complex, suggesting that cooperation between the domains requires physical linkage or begins already at the stage of protein synthesis. Indeed, we found that the CTD requires a well-folded N-terminal partner to fold correctly. It is also possible that the peptide linker between the NTD and the CTD plays a role in coordinating binding and catalysis. This specialization of complementary functions and resulting mutual dependence of domains (concerning both protein stability and enzymatic activity) are likely to be common to other ‘pseudodimeric’ MTases with partially degenerated motifs, such as the protein-arginine MTase PRMT7 and in RNA modification enzymes composed of several homologous domains. Recently, Dontsova and coworkers characterized experimentally three E. coli rRNA:m2G MTases: RlmL that modifies G2445 in 23S rRNA (31), RlmG that modifies G1835 in 23S rRNA (18) and RsmD that modifies G66 in 16S rRNA (32). They have demonstrated that RsmD is encoded by the YhhF open reading frame (ORF), and that the YgjO ORF encodes not the RsmD enzyme as previously believed (14,33), but RlmG. They have also determined the structure of YhhF/RsmD, which revealed a single catalytic domain (32). Based on these findings, Dontsova and coworkers proposed a hypothesis that E. coli rRNA:m2G MTases can be divided into two categories based on the domain structure and substrate specificity: MTases composed of multiple domains would recognize protein-free ribosomal RNA in vitro and most probably, unfolded early assembly intermediates in vivo, while MTases comprising only the catalytic domain would recognize only late assembly intermediates resembling the completed 30S particle and not the free RNA (34). They predicted that RlmG and RlmL (whose structures remain unknown) are composed of multiple domains, and that RsmC closely resembles RsmD in that it is composed only of a single domain (32). On the other hand, our results clearly show that RsmC is composed of two domains and is closely related to RlmG (YgjO) rather than RsmD (YhhF). Besides, RsmD has been shown to require the presence of proteins S7 and S19 with the 16S rRNA to be recognized by the enzyme (35). Thus, it appears that the relationship between structure and substrate specificity in rRNA:m2G MTases is more complex and cannot be inferred simply from the number of domains in different proteins.SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Supplementary Data are available at NAR online.

Genes of the 14-3-3 family are conserved from plants to humans, and some members are responsive to UV radiation. Despite the high rate of pollution generated by nano-pollutants, up to now their toxic effect on development is totally obscure. Embryos treated with carbon nanoparticles, RNA preparation, retro-transcription and quantitative real-time PCR. In response to carbon nano-particles exposure, the embryos collected 24 h later showed a 3,07-fold at 5x1012 p and a 1,58-fold at 2.5x1013 p and a 1,92-fold at 2.5x1014 p increase in Pl14-3-3ε transcript levels compared with controls. The Pl14-3-3ε mRNA delocalization parallels the failure in archenteron elongation observed morphologically, as well as the lack of specific endoderm markers. Here, we report the isolation of the complete cDNA encoding the 14-3-3 epsilon isoform from Paracentrotus lividus sea urchin embryos, referred to as Pl14-3-3ε. Pl14-3-3ε mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR during development and found to increase from the mesenchyme blastula to the prism stage. Our results confirm the involvement of 14-3-3ε in the stress response elicited by carbon nano-particles.

Our results confirm the involvement of 14-3-3ε in the stress response elicited by carbon nano-particles. The term nano-pollution is generically referring to all waste generated during the fabrication of nanomaterials. These types of waste can be very dangerous because of their size, nanoparticles in the free state can be released into the air during production (or production accidents) or as waste, only to accumulate in the soil, in water or vegetable and thus be assimilated by the animals causing unknown effects. An environmental assessment of this phenomenon is very important because it could lead to define new environmental impacts. Currently one can not accurately predict or control the ecological impacts due to the releaseof these nano-pollutants in the environment. Ecotoxicological impacts of nanoparticles and the potential for bioaccumulation in plants and microorganisms are still under research. In this regard, this work has examined the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, a model organism used in studies on embryonic development, and was exposed to the effects of carbon nanoparticles, synthesized according to the electrochemical method. Members of the 14-3-3 protein family are involved in many important cellular events, including stress response, survival and apoptosis. Genes of the 14-3-3 family are conserved from plants to humans, and some members are responsive to UV radiation. Despite the high rate of their toxic effect on development pollution generated by nano-pollutants, up to now is totally obscure. Russo showed the isolation of the complete cDNA encoding the 14-3-3 epsilon isoform from Paracentrotus lividus sea urchin embryos, referred to as Pl14-3-3ε (1). Proteins of the 14-3-3 family are considered as chaperones/adaptors, playing important roles in cellular homeostasis (2,3). Their involvement in stress response has been claimed as evidenced by the increased protein/mRNA levels following exposure to drugs and pesticides. For example, different subsets of 14-3-3 genes were induced after treatment with the fungal toxin fusicoccin in the tomato plant, demonstrating a correlation with the pathogen-associated defense response (4). In sponges, the 14-3-3 gene is induced by pesticides (PCB 118), in parallel with the increase in the levels of the heat shock protein 70 transcript, suggesting their role in preventing apoptosis (5). Under physiological conditions 14-3-3 homo- and hetero-dimers (6,7) can interact with a wide variety of signalling proteins, including the stress signalling BAD/BAX mitochondrial proteins and the FOXO transcription factor. This interaction is possible only if 14-3-3 proteins are un-phosphorylated and, by sequestering BAD, BAX and FOXO in the cytoplasm, their entrance into the mitochondrion/nucleus is prevented. Following stress, 14-3-3 are phosphorylated by the JNK kinase and cannot bind the pro-apoptotic proteins, which are free to localize to their site of action, promoting apoptosis (8,9). Seven 14-3-3 isoforms (β, γ, ε, ζ, η, σ, τ) are known in mammals (8,10); up to 14 were described in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (11), while two isoforms have been identified in yeast, Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori (ε and ζ) (12,13). At least one isoform has been found in the sponge Geodia cynodium (5), and in the sea urchins Heliocidaris tuberculata, Heliocidaris erythrogramma (14). Three isoforms were annotated in the genome of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, one referred to as ε, and two known as the isoforms 1 and 2 (15,16). The sea urchin embryo is one of the most used marine invertebrates models for studying apoptosis, cellular stress and biochemical markers of pollution (17-22). It offers a suitable model for toxicological and developmental studies as the feeding larva (pluteus) is complete in about 48 h; the specification of the embryonic territories, including ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, begins as early as the 32- cells cleavage stage (23). The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal and spatial expression of the 14-3-3ε gene in P. lividus sea urchin embryos, during development and in response to carbon nanoparticles treatment. The complete cDNA encoding Pl14-3-3ε was isolated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from NPC exposed embryos mRNA. Quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) analysis was used to assess the extent of gene expression.Material and methods Embryo culture and micromanipulation Adult Paracentrotus lividus sea urchins were collected along the coast of Salento. Eggs were fertilized and embryos cultured at a dilution of 4.000/mL in Millipore Filtered Sea Water (MFSW) containing antibiotics, at 16–18°C. Animals were induced to shed gametes by intracoelomic injection of 0.5 M KCl. Eggs were washed several times with filtered, natural seawater (SW), fertilized with a dilute suspension of sperm and cultured in SW in glass bowls. Morphological analysis The morphological analysis of perturbed and control embryos was performed using an inverted microscope Nikon Eclipse 80i, the images were recorded by a digital camera Nikon DMX 1200F. Treatments with carbon nanoparticles To a suspension of eggs fertilized were added in four different glass bowls i) control; ii)5×1012; iii) 2,5×1013; and iv)2,5×1014 carbon nanoparticles. Embryos at different developmental stages (6h, 24h) were collected by low-speed centrifugation. RNA preparation and relative RT-PCR analysis Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions using TRIzol® Plus RNA Purification System (Invitrogen) from 25 collected embryos, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until use. Briefly, total RNA (20μg) isolated from control and embryos treated with carbon nano-particles as described above were run on 1.5% agarose gel, under denaturing conditions (formamide 50%, MOPS 1X, formaldeide 5.5%). Quantitative real-time PCR cDNAs were synthesized according to a single-step ThermoScript™ RT-PCR Systems kit (Invitrogen) protocol. About 0.1–1% of each RT reaction was used to run real-time PCR on a SmartCycler System (Cepheid) with SYBR® Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich) and the primer pairs indicated in Table ​1. Real-time PCR samples were run in triplicate. Quantification measurements of gene expression were performed as described by the manual of Applied Biosystems Step One Plus real time PCR, a Comparative Threshold Cycle Method, using SYBR Green chemistry (24). Pl-S24 mRNA was used as the internal endogenous reference gene (25). The QPCR was run as follow: 1X cycle denaturing 95°C for 10 min for DNA polymerase activation; 38 cycles: melting 95°C for 15 sec, annealing/extension 60°C for 60 sec. Synthesis of Carbon nanoparticles Carbon nanoparticles colloidal solution was obtained in the following. High purity graphite rod (SPI 99.99%) was used as an anode (5 mm diam), and a stainless steel rod (SWAGELOK AISI 1016, 5 mm diam) was used as a cathode. The electrodes were immersed in a becker containing deionized water (MILLIPORE MILLIP-Q 18.2 M) at a reciprocal distance of 10 mm. In the electrolysis process, the electric power applied to the electrodes was a constant voltage of 30 V. Simultaneously, the colloidal solution was forcedly dispersed by an ultrasonicator, which was the flat-type ultrasonic equipment (Flexonic-1200-35/72/ 100G, Mirae Ultrasonic Tech., Korea). To prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles, the ultrasonicator was continuously operated at the power output of 1000 W with the frequency of 100±5 kHz during the production of nanographite. At the end of the reaction the solution of nanoparticles is diluted with distilled water (20ml solution of nanoparticles and 30 ml of water). The average size, size distribution, morphology and internal crystalline structure of the nanoparticles are studied through high resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected-area diffraction pattern and UV–Vis spectroscopic technique. Physical analyses of carbon nanoparticles solution UV-visible spectra were recorded in the range between 200 and 800 nm using a T80 PG Instruments Ltd spectrophotometer. Optical spectra where obtained immediately after the synthesis and after 6-7 days by measuring the absorption of the prepared as in a quartz cuvette with a 1 cm optical path. Raman scattering measurements were obtained by back-scattering geometry with a RENISHAW spectrometer coupled to a LEICA metallographic microscope. An argon-ion laser operated at a wavelength of 514.5 nm and a 10mW incident power to avoid thermal effects provided excitation. Raman shifts were corrected by using silicon (111) reference spectra after each measurement. All spectra were recorded at room temperature. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images and electron diffraction patterns were taken using an Hitachi 7100, at 100 kV representing the suitable acceleration voltage to obtain a good resolution and minimal radiation damage of the material. The specimens were prepared for transmission electron microscope observations by placing small droplets of colloidal solutions onto standard carbon supported 600-mesh copper grid and drying slowly in air naturally.Results UV–Vis absorption measurements A typical UV–Vis spectra set recorded in the range between 200 and 800 nm immediately after the synthesis and after 72 and 144 hours is shown in Fig.1. The presence of a well defined peak at 236 nm is evident and also a shoulder at ~310 nm, that can be attributed to π→π* transitions of aromatic C-C bonds and n→π* transitions of C=O bonds, respectively, according to the experimental data reported for the unreduced nanocarbon dispersion (26,27). It is interesting to note that the position of the peak remains unchanged over time, showing the stability of the nanoparticles dispersed in solution with a negligible aggregation and a sedimentation almost nothing. In the inset of Fig.1 the Raman spectrum is reported. The peaks at about 1350, 1582, 1617 and 2700 cm-1 are assignable to carbon-based materials in low-dimensional configuration sp2 that is nanographite particles having dimensions of a few nanometers (28).Fig 1 UV-vis absorption spectra of carbon nanoparticles immediately after the synthesis, after 72 and 144 hours. Related Raman spectrum (inset) To evaluate the exact size and structure of nanoparticles and to understand the aggregation process and the mechanism involved (29) a morphological analysis has been performed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). A typical TEM image is reported in Fig.2, it is evident that the carbon nanoparticles were almost spherical and were 3 nm great with a statistical standard deviation (ᵟ) of 2 nm as evident in the inset that report the histogram showing the size dispersion of observed carbon nanoparticles. Differential expression of Paracentrotus lividus 14-3-3ε mRNA in control embryos We performed quantitative PCR experiments with cDNA samples obtained by reverse transcription from total RNA extracted at different developmental stages of sea urchin embryos: unfertilized eggs as T0, T6 and T24. Quantitative measurements were performed using a comparative threshold cycle method, in which the Pl-S24 cDNA PCR product was used as an endogenous control gene, which was assumed to be constant during development. The egg cDNA was used as reference sample and was assumed as 1 in arbitrary units. The histogram in Fig.3 shows the Pl14-3-3ε transcript levels during sea urchin development: the relative quantity fold ranged from 0,6 at 6h after fertilization to 4.5 at the late gastrula phase (24h after fertilization).Fig 2 Transmission electron microscope image and histogram of silver nanoparticles size distribution (insetFig 3 Quantitative PCR analysis of the P. lividus 14-3-3ε transcription levels in sea urchin embryos at different developmental stages, showed in the lower panel: eggs, morula, late gastrula, 0, 6, 24 hours post-fertilization. Pl-S24 was used as normalizing endogenous gene; cDNA extracted from eggs was used as reference sample and assumed as 1 in the histogram. Each bar represents the mean of three independent experiments ±SD. Mean values were significantly different according to the one-way ANOVA (P<0.05). We selected the morula stage and late gastrula stage for measure Pl14-3-3ε transcript levels after carbon nanoparticles exposure. Previous study, infact, demonstrated lower levels between eight cell stage and morula, as well as at the pluteus stage. Therefore, it seems that during the period between fertilization and morula, no mRNA synthesis is required, as the transcripts detected in the unfertilized egg are probably used during the first developmental stages. Moreover, the 32 cell stage is a crucial period during development and represents an ideal stage to study stress effects. The histogram summarizes results of three independent QPCR analyses. Morphology in control and carbon nanoparticles exposed embryos The sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus is a classical model for ecotoxicological studies due to the particular sensitivity to environmental events related to fertilization and development. In this experiment the toxicity of a solution of carbon nanoparticles was evaluated by testing three different doses 5×1012 p, 2.5×1013 p and 2.5×1014 p with a period of light/dark and controlled flow of oxygen and under aseptic conditions, while a control was carried out at the same time. The events that characterize the stages of fertilization until the early stagesof development were checked at the inverted optical microscope. The fertilized egg undergoes a first division meridian gives rise to two equal blastomeres. In the control observed that 90% of fertilized eggs follows a normal division, while the remaining 10% produces asymmetrical blastomeres. In NPC treated with low amounts of 70% of the cells are dividing, two blastomeres are observed and remain equal to the membrane around the sperm fertilization. the percentage of dividing cells with normal increases in the treatment medium and high concentration, 77% and 82.25%, respectively. At the same time is observed for each treatment asymmetrical percentage of dividing cells, in particular the 30% treated with low amounts of NPC, 20.5% in the treated medium in quantity and 17.59% treated with high amounts. After 4-6hours in the samples treated with different concentrations of NPC, 5x1012 p, 2.5x1013 p and 2.5x1014 p observed respectively 65%, 60% and 70% of normal morula. Up to 48 hours, the relationship between normal embryos and modified remain unchanged under all conditions set up. The normal embryos proceed in development to the formation of gastrulae, while the altered embryos progressing to the stage of blastula, however, characterized by altered structures (Fig.4). Fig 4 Embryos incubated at 6 and 18 hours in the presence of carbon nanoparticles Expression of Pl14-3-3 ε in control and carbon nanoparticles exposed embryos Quantitative analysis of Pl14-3-3ε specific transcript, normalized to Pl24S rRNA, was performed by reverse transcriptase (RT) real-time PCR. In order to investigate that the carbon nanoparticles had an effect on the Pl14-3-3ε gene, mRNA expression levels were investigated by QPCR in control and carbon nanoparticles exposed embryos at the doses of 5x1012 p, 2.5x1013 p and 2.5x1014 p. The CTRL cDNA was assumed as 1 in arbitrary units. The histogram in Fig.5 shows the Pl14-3-3ε transcript levels at the late gastrula phase (24h after fertilization). It is possible to observe an increment of 3,07 folds in the embryos incubated with 5x1012p, of 1,58 folds in the embryos incubated with 2,5x1013p, of 1,92 folds in the embryos incubated with 2,5x1014p. RT-PCR results are in agreement with the statistics obtained by morphological observation of the embryos. This is observed in the various treaties that embryos grown in the presence of low concentrations of carbon nanoparticles are most damaged, and the gene Pl-14-3-3-epsilon is more expressed, because of its involvement in response to stress factors. Instead of embryos grown with medium and high concentrations of nanoparticles show damage less obvious and less increase of Pl-14-3-3 epsilon gene.Fig 5 RT-PCR of the Pl-14-3-3 epsilon gene in embryos incubated at 24 hours without and with the presence of carbon nanoparticlesDiscussion The Paracentrotus lividus is one of excellence in animal models to study water pollution and, in general, the environment. the rate of toxicity induced by nanoparticles allows to analyze changes in cell behavior from the earliest stages of development until the formation of larva. During this period the orgasnism is particularly delicate because they occur important biochemical and physiological changes. any contact with toxic substances, could result in slowing down or speeding up the development or the development is not correct and/or death of the organism, or a subsequent accumulation of toxic substances during larvale. Our results suggest that the carbon nanoparticles cause changes (asymmetric divisions) and acceleration of development between two and four hours. These irregular behavior, although clearly visible in all three treatments are much more evident in the treatment 5x1012p. These results are in agreement with literature data: In fact, Nel (30) has demonstrated the toxicity of carbon nanotubes in mammalian cells suggesting oxidative stress as the most likely mechanism to explain the toxicity. This study has highlighted the negative effects of carbon nanoparticles in aquatic species and, therefore, we believe that we should pay particular attention to all applications involving the use of carbon nanomaterials. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a direct relationship between carbon nanoparticles exposure of sea urchin embryos and Pl14-3-3ε mRNA levels, suggesting its implication in the regulative cascade activated in the stress response. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a carbon nanoparticles induced 14-3-3ε transcriptional regulative mechanism has been demonstrated. As previously described, upon stress 14-3-3 proteins are phosphorylated by the JNK kinase and are thus unable to bind BAD, BAX and FOXO, which are then able to translocate to mitochondria and nuclei, exerting their pro-apoptotic functions (31,32). The increase in Pl14-3-3ε mRNA detected after NPC stress could result in higher 14-3-3 protein levels (possibly not phosphorylated) which could then bind a large quantity of the above mentioned factors, determining cellular survival. On the basis of studies described by Russo et al. 2010 we confirmed the use of sea urchin embryos for examining the role of 14-3-3 in cell stress response pathways. Finally, 14-3-3ε could be used as a valuable molecular biomarker to identify the dangerous effects of sunlight occurring in marine organisms living in shallow waters. In this study, we observed the transcriptional response of gene 14-3-3 in Paracentrotus lividus, and provide data to demonstrate its response to carbon nanoparticles showing that a clear correlation exists between nanoparticles exposure and the transcriptional regulation of this gene. Previous studies showed a rapid induction of 14-3-3’s in tomato plant roots deprived of iron (33). This is particularly interesting due to the close coupling of copper and iron metabolism (34), demonstrated by their shared cell surface reductases Fre1 and Fre2. Direct evidence for the role of 14-3-3 in stress response has been shown in the macro-alga Fucus vesiculosus (35).

This observation, as well as epidemic clustering of some autoimmune diseases following xenobiotic exposure, reinforces the thesis that autoimmune disease is secondary to both genetic and environmental factors. Because nonliving agents do not have genomes, disease characteristics involving nonliving xenobiotics are primarily secondary to host phenotype and function. In addition, because of individual genetic susceptibilities based not only on major histocompatibility complex differences but also on differences in toxin metabolism, lifestyles, and exposure rates, individuals will react differently to the same chemicals. With these comments in mind it is important to note that there have been associations of a number of xenobiotics with human autoimmune disease, including mercury, iodine, vinyl chloride, canavanine, organic solvents, silica, l-tryptophan, particulates, ultraviolet radiation, and ozone. In addition, there is discussion in the literature that raises the possibility that xenobiotics may also exacerbate an existing autoimmune disease. In this article we discuss these issues and, in particular, the evidence for the role of environmental agents in the initiation or progression of autoimmune conditions.

In addition, the incorporation of gene-gene interactions in the statistical model provides further insight into the genetic factors that underlie body composition traits. We used Bayesian model selection to comprehensively map main, epistatic and sex-specific QTL in an F2 reciprocal intercross between two chicken lines divergently selected for high or low growth rate. We identified 17 QTL with main effects across 13 chromosomes and several sex-specific and sex-antagonistic QTL for breast meat yield, thigh + drumstick yield and abdominal fatness. Different sets of QTL were found for both breast muscles [and ], which suggests that they could be controlled by different regulatory mechanisms. Significant interactions of QTL by sex allowed detection of sex-specific and sex-antagonistic QTL for body composition and abdominal fat. We found several female-specific QTL and sex-antagonistic and abdominal fatness QTL. Also, several QTL on different chromosomes interact with each other to affect body composition and abdominal fatness. The detection of main effects, epistasis and sex-dimorphic QTL suggest complex genetic regulation of somatic growth. An understanding of such regulatory mechanisms is key to mapping specific genes that underlie QTL controlling somatic growth in an avian model.

An understanding of such regulatory mechanisms is key to mapping specific genes that underlie QTL controlling somatic growth in an avian model. Background A clear understanding of the genetic architecture of body composition is important in chicken breeding. Genetic selection over the past 50 years has produced commercial meat-type (broiler) chickens with a higher yield of breast meat, which is also accompanied by increased body fatness [1]. Breast muscle yield is the most important carcass component in meat-type chickens because of the high premium paid by consumers. However, excess accumulation of body fat is undesirable because it reduces the efficiency of feed utilization and it adds the additional expense of trimming unwanted fat during processing [2]. Higher consumption of excess dietary saturated fat contributes to artherosclerosis in humans. Therefore delineating major genes that underlie carcass traits has important implications for both agriculture and human health. Crosses from extreme strains and/or breeds of chickens have been used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for body composition traits including fatness [3-9]. Despite the importance of dissecting the genetic basis of body composition in the chicken, body composition QTL mapping studies to date have been restricted to delineating the main (additive and dominance) genetic effects. Incorporation of epistasis and sex-dimorphism into QTL analyses has the potential to identify novel epistasis QTL, and sex-specific and sex-antagonistic QTL [10,11]. Physiological differences between sexes can influence gene expression [12]. Therefore, sex-specific QTL are to be expected for carcass traits, especially abdominal fatness. Abasht et al. [7] have mapped an abdominal fatness QTL on chicken chromosome 5 (GGA5) that exhibits sexual dimorphism. Furthermore, several sex-specific QTL for body composition have been reported in humans and in rodent models [13,14]. Empirical evidence suggests that fat and body composition traits are influenced by epistasis [11,15]. Earlier studies by Carlborg et al. [16] and Yi et al. [11,17,18] have demonstrated that joint assessment of regions on the genome, on either the same chromosome or different chromosomes have significant effects on traits. Therefore, inclusion of gene-gene interactions in the statistical model is essential in providing comprehensive mapping of the genetic factors that underlie body composition traits. Modeling of these gene interactions has been challenging because of the large number of variables [19] and the decreased power of the statistical analysis [20]. These drawbacks can be ameliorated by utilizing a Bayesian model selection method which models main, epistatic and gene-environmental effects simultaneously [19]. The Bayesian approach has been used successfully to identify several epistatic QTL associated with growth and body composition in mice [11,18]. Herein, we used Yi et al.'s [21] Bayesian model selection method to comprehensively investigate main, sex-specific and gene-gene interaction effects of body composition traits in a chicken population divergently selected for high or low growth rate.ResultsMain effect QTL The trait means and standard deviations for the F2 resource population are presented in Table 1. The main-effect QTL affecting carcass traits are summarized in Table 2. Seventeen QTL with significant linkages were observed on 13 chromosomes (Figure 1). A QTL for the Pectoralis (P) major weight was found on GGA7 at 87 cM and for Pectoralis minor weight on GGA3, 4 and 17. Nevertheless, adjusting P. minor for BW at 9 wk only confirmed the QTL on GGA4 and 17. A thigh + drumstick QTL was located on GGA27 at 0 cM. Seven QTL for ABFW were identified on GGA1, 2, 5, 7, 14, 15 and 18. Adjusting ABFW with BW at 9 wk revealed additional QTL for ABFY on GGA1, 3, 5, 9, 12, and 27. The TDW and TDY QTL co-localized with an ABFY QTL on GGA27. The QTL effect in terms of genotypic mean placements and the proportion of the phenotypic variance explained are also shown in Table 2. The main effect QTL explained from 1 to 14% of the phenotypic variance. The P. major and P. minor yields QTL on GGA7 and GGA17, each explained about 6% of the phenotypic variance. The ABFW QTL on GGA5 and GGA7 contributes ~27% of the phenotypic variance.Table 1 Body composition traits of F2 individuals from F1 crosses of divergent chicken lines selected for high or low growth (mean ± standard deviation)TraitMale(N = 371)Female(N = 324)Breast meat weight, g69.22 ± 9.5458.16 ± 8.96Breast meat yield, %5.57 ± 0.415.82 ± 0.48Abdominal fat weight, g18.86 ± 11.2918.52 ± 11.24Abdominal fat yield, %1.48 ± 0.801.80 ± 0.98Pectoralis major weight, g51.24 ± 7.1642.86 ± 6.77Pectoralis major yield, %4.12 ± 0.324.29 ± 0.37Pectoralis minor weight, g17.94 ± 2.7315.30 ± 2.45Pectoralis minor yield, %1.44 ± 0.141.53 ± 0.15Thigh + drumstick weight, g142.16 ± 18.10109.48 ± 16.05Thigh + drumstick yield, %11.43 ± 0.3910.97 ± 0.46Table 2 Main QTL effects, location and phenotypic variance explained by body composition traits in chicken lines divergently selected for low or high growth for combined sex.ChromosomeQTL Position (cM)2Log BF1Effect2Variance explained by QTL effectBreast meat yield 787.06.7749.173.01Pectoralis major weight 787.06.4846.343.02Pectoralis major yield 783.08.0780.137.00Pectoralis minor weight 378.72.21-23.551.09 414.04.0228.661.08 1721.011.0839.596.63Pectoralis minor yield 412.04.6930.621.64 1721.011.3038.116.17Thigh + drumstick weight 270.010.1732.191.16Thigh + drumstick yield 270.010.7324.551.34Abdominal fat weight 1202.07.25154.386.62 2276.06.66-217.644.03 5101.48.63-28.2313.26 72.111.13128.1313.74 1416.46.1069.837.08 1530.85.39-29.935.09 1814.99.34-42.463.80Abdominal fat yield 1424.54.0447.292.26 376.64.56-21.281.10 510.06.690.664.28 912.03.9527.061.71 1218.73.454.331.05 270.08.2614.041.97 1 Twice the log of the Bayes Factor 2Main effect of the QTLFigure 1 One-dimensional profiles of Bayes factors rescaled as 2loge BF for main (solid lines), epistatic effects (dotted lines) and sex-specific effects (dashed lines).

The horizontal lines represent the significance threshold of 2logeBF = 2.1.QTL × Sex interactions The presence of significant QTL by sex interactions in the model for all parameters presently considered suggested either sex specificity or sex-influenced QTL. We identified several sex-specific and sex-antagonistic QTL which are listed in Supplementary 1. Sexual dimorphism was observed for both P. major and P. minor yield on GGA2 and 5. Whereas, all QTL detected for P. major were female-specific, both male-and female-specific QTL were identified for P. minor QTL. Multiple QTL were detected on the same chromosome in some cases, but for different sexes. For example, a male-specific P. minor yield QTL was detected on GGA5 at 0 cM, whereas, the female- specific QTL was detected at 12 cM. The phenotypic variances explained by these sex-specific QTL ranged from 1 to 27%.Epistatic effects Significant QTL by QTL interactions were found for both muscle yield and abdominal fatness traits. Each epistatic QTL explained ~3 to 25% (Table 3) of the phenotypic variance. A highly significant epistatic QTL (2logBF ~17.49; GGA2/6) for ABFY explained approximately 25% of the phenotypic variance. A region on GGA2 (284-293 cM) interacts with GGA1, 6 and 27 and explains a large (~12 to 25%) proportion of the phenotypic variance for ABFY. The same position on GGA2 interacts with other regions of the genome to influence P. major weight and yield. In addition to inter-chromosomal interactions, an intra-chromosomal interaction affecting P. major yield was found between positions 33.4 and 83.0 cM on GGA7. Significant interactions were found between QTL for ABFY on GGA1 and 2 (Figure 2A). Fat weight on the other hand was strongly influenced by interactions between GGA1 and 1, GGA1 and18, GGA1 and 15, GGA1 and 18, and GGA2 and 18 (Figure 2B).Table 3 Epistatic QTL effects, locations and phenotypic variance explained for body composition traits in a chicken line divergently selected for low or high growthChromosomeInteracting QTL positions2LogBFEpistatic EffectVariance explained by Epistatic QTLBreast meat yield 2/5331.6/86.89.49165.003.92 2/7256.0/101.010.54251.003.34 5/7132.5/89.013.36148.005.57 7/762.3/91.014.12113.1010.01 11/116.2/16.59.31129.504.54Pectoralis major weight 2/3315.0/70.48.34209.703.39 2/5329.0/82.69.30157.204.70 2/7307.0/133.09.95276.203.98 5/7107.7/72.912.78157.006.58 7/739.6/77.013.95100.307.28Pectoralis major yield 2/2284.0/313.06.80205.003.17 2/5292.4/63.68.63143.003.32 5/720.1/68.613.9281.008.29 5/930.4/40.112.2536.002.81 7/739.6/68.612.93103.008.16Pectoralis minor weight 2/5290.3/14.020.16109.207.63 2/11290.3/41.016.8860.268.52 5/1169.9/14.417.4935.804.09 10/1742.0/6.315.8428.403.20 11/1726.8/21.017.7521.054.98Pectoralis minor yield 2/4294.5/14.015.47119.597.60 2/5288.2/2.020.3294.307.70 2/17294.5/21.019.82123.236.69 5/1110.0/18.517.8826.772.85 11/1722.6/21.018.0616.965.69Thigh + drumstick weight 1/140.9/436.713.12264.506.80 1/542.9/65.712.70135.006.69 1/27106.0/0.017.10161.608.11 3/5266.7/48.912.89144.103.55 7/27151.0/0.019.9868.103.94Thigh + drumstick yield 1/147.0/416.413.57264.216.73 1/7128.0/6.415.67127.745.64 1/27104.0/0.017.52101.128.09 2/791.0/6.410.33127.744.68 10/2753.0/0.016.749.524.23Fat weight 1/1196.0/529.214.16522.0010.62 1/11210.2/39.09.48469.007.80 1/15206.0/20.514.1561.5012.26 1/18194.0/10.66.18511.4016.60 2/18286.1/14.96.84492.3010.81Fat yield 1/2229.0/284.016.3798.9717.11 2/2192.0/288.014.8789.4117.43 2/6292.4/73.017.4982.2724.73 2/27292.4/0.020.151.6812.06 5/620.1/75.016.1749.5011.01Figure 2 Two-dimensional profiles of Bayes factors (rescaled as 2logeBF) for fat yield (Figure 2A) and fat weight (Figure 2B) for selected chromosomes. The upper diagonal shows the Bayes factor for the epistatic model, the lower diagonal shows the Bayes factor for the full model with epistasis compared with no QTL.Discussion Most traits of economic and biomedical importance are influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Using techniques that allow for inclusion of epistasis and sex-specificity in a QTL model enables a better understanding of the genetic regulatory mechanisms that underlie body composition. Chicken breast muscle is comprised of two distinct muscle groups: the P. major and the P. minor. A significant main- effect QTL for BMY was detected on GGA7; yet analysis of each breast muscle indicates that P. major was the only trait contributing to BMY on GGA7. The location of the P. major QTL is similar to that reported for BMY [9,22]. The QTL region for P. major yield contains several genes [the interferon induced with helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1), glucagon (GCG), ring finger protein 25 (RNF25) and BAX inhibitor motif containing 1 (TMBIM1)]. We identified three novel QTL for P. minor weight on GGA3, 4 and 17; however after adjustment with BW at 9 wk, the QTL on GGA4 and 17 met the level of significance. The P. minor yield QTL on GGA17 explained approximately 6% of the phenotypic variation. The pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 3 (PBX3), a homeobox gene is located within this QTL region. Most studies evaluate breast meat as a single trait [8,23,24]. The current study suggests that these traits should be treated independently since they are influenced by different QTL. We also identified a QTL for TDW and TDY at the same location (0 cM) on GGA27. The 0 cM region of GGA27 harbors the mitogenic activated protein kinase kinase 14 (MAP3K14), defender against cell death 1 (DAD1) and MYST histone acetyltransferase 2 (MYST2) genes. Intensive genetic selection of meat-type chicken during the the last 50 years has led to rapid somatic (muscle) growth and a concomitant increase in ABFY [25]. Abdominal fatness is a complex trait affected both by genes, environmental factors (nutrition, appetite, behavior, etc), and their interactions. In the present study, we found QTL for ABFW on GGA1, 2, 5, 7, 14, 15 and 18. The QTL for ABFW on GGA1, 5, 15 and 18 were similar to the location reported for these traits in other chicken populations [4,6,22]. When ABFW was corrected for BW at 9 wk, ABFY QTL were confirmed on GGA1 and GGA5, and novel ones were identified on GGA3, 9, 12 and 27. The ABFY QTL on GGA27 co-localized with the TDY QTL, while the position of the ABFY QTL on GGA3 is similar to a suggested fatness QTL (10% chromosome-wide significance) by Lagarrigue et al. [18]. The ABFY QTL on GGA1 harbors thyroid hormone responsive protein (THRSP) which is a nuclear protein expressed in lipogenic tissues (liver, fat and lactating mammary glands), and is involved in the transduction of hormonal and dietary signals for increased lipid metabolism [26]. The THRSP gene is differentially expressed in the high and low lines; and mutants of THRSPα are associated with ABF in chickens [27]. The THRSP gene also modulates tumorigenesis in human breast cancer [28]. Positional candidate genes that underlie the GGA3 ABFY QTL include inhibitor of growth, family member 1 (ING1), Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 7 (ARHGEF7) and ankyrin repeat domain 10 (ANKRD10). The ABFY QTL on GGA5 harbors the insulin gene and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene. A biallelic marker in the chicken IGF2 gene appears to be associated with growth and carcass traits [29].Sex-specific QTL Several studies in other species point to sex-bias, sex specificity or sex antagonism in QTL analysis [30-32]. The approach allows us to test for interactions between QTL and sex. A QTL by sex interaction with a Bayes Factor (2LogBF) ≥ 2.1 was considered as sex specific (QTL influencing a trait in only one sex) or sex antagonistic (QTL with allelic effects going in opposite directions between the sexes). A sex antagonistic fatness QTL has been reported in chickens divergently selected for abdominal fatness [7]. Sex-antagonistic QTL for ABFY were found on GGA2, 4, 6, 12, 14 and 19. Male-specific QTL for ABFY on GGA2 and GGA4 were similar to those reported by Jennen et al. [4] and McElroy et al. [6], respectively. However, the ABFY QTL on GGA6, 12, 14 and 19 (Additional file 1) are unique to the HG × LG cross. There were several female-specific QTL affecting P. major yield, and contrarily several sex-antagonistic QTL affecting P. minor yield. Some fatness QTL were also found to be sex-antagonistic in the current study. The male-specific QTL for ABFW was within the confidence interval of the sex-antagonistic QTL for abdominal fatness reported by Abasht et al. [7]. Sex-specific QTL and their genetic inter-relationships have been reported for human obesity and lipid levels [14]. The mechanisms underlying sex-specific, sex influenced or sex-antagonistic effects are unknown although the influence of sex hormones on the regulation of the genes that underlie these QTL is the first evident hypothesis. Other parameters showing sex-dimorphism (such as food intake, plasma nutrient levels etc.) may exert further additional controls on their own. The fine mapping strategies utilized to identify major genes that underlie QTL would depend on whether QTL effect is additive, epistatic, sex-specific or sex-antagonistic.Epistatic QTL effects By definition, a complex trait is affected by many genes, each with a small effect, the environment and gene by environment interactions. However, in most instances the summation of the additive effects of each single-locus cannot explain all the phenotypic variation of a particular trait. The dependency of one locus upon another, referred to as epistasis, also contributes towards the phenotypic variation. The inclusion of epistatic effects through interactions of different QTL regions (same or different chromosomes) in QTL mapping allows for the detection of novel loci. Epistatic QTL explained between 3 to 25% of the phenotypic variation. Epistasis QTL involving positions on GGA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 17 and 27 were associated with body composition traits in the current study. An earlier study utilizing a White Leghorn × Red Jungle fowl cross identified many epistatic pairs that affected both early and late growth [16]. They argued that, the degree of divergence between their populations could be the reason for the measured epistasis. Gene interactions may be the norm rather than the exception. Limited studies on epistasis QTL are due principally to the lack of statistical methods with sufficient power to detect them, rather than their lack of existence. Other studies have described the effect of epistasis on fatness in mice [11,17,18,33,34]. Genes that underlie interacting QTL may interact biologically or may code for enzymes involved in common pathways [35]. Several positional candidate genes at the GGA2 284-286.1 cM region [Yamaguchi sarcoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (YES1), GATA-6-transcription factor (GATA-6), retinoblastoma binding protein 8 (RBBP8), Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1)] could be interacting with other genes on GGA6 and 27 to affect abdominal fatness in meat-type chickens. It appears that some of the candidate genes that underlie QTL for ABFY are also associated with breast cancer in humans [28]. Therefore candidate genes within the QTL regions identified in this study should be investigated for their biologically significance to body composition in chickens and to obesity and cancers in humans.Conclusions We have studied the main genetic and interactive effects of trait loci that affect body composition in chickens. Our studies have confirmed some known QTL http://www.animalgenome.org/QTLdb/chicken.html and identified some novel QTL in the high and low growth line intercross. The Bayesian statistical strategy has allowed us to concurrently explore epistatic, sex-specific and sex-antagonistic QTL. Identification of genes that underlie QTL regions and their interactions as demonstrated by significant QTL-QTL interactions should provide insight into an elaborate network of genes and will help to elucidate their role in body composition and fatness in chickens and possibly breast cancer in humans.MethodsExperimental population An F2 population was generated by inter-mating two experimental boiler lines that had been divergently selected for high (HG) or low growth (LG) rate [36]. In the F0 generation, five HG males were mated to 16 LG females (HL) and 5 LG males to 9 HG females (LH). From the F1 generation, 3 HL males were mated with 30 HL females and 2 LH males were intercrossed with 20 LH females to generate an F2 resource population of 695 (371 males and 324 females) F2 individuals. The F2 population was produced in four hatches, fed a standard broiler diets ad libitum (3050 kcal ME (Metabolizable energy) from 0-3 wks, 3100 kcal ME from 4-9 wks), and raised under standard management practices for nine weeks. Blood was taken from all birds for genomic DNA extraction. At 9-wk, birds were weighed after an overnight fast and slaughtered. After evisceration, carcasses were stored overnight at 4°C before dissection. The carcass traits measured are breast meat weight (BMW) and yield (BMY), and its two components: P major and P. minor weights, abdominal fat weight (ABFW) and thigh + drumstick weight (TDW). Trait weights were corrected for week 9 body weight to generate P. major yield, P. major yield, ABF yield (ABFY) and thigh + drumstick yield (TDY).Genotyping DNA was extracted from whole blood by a quick preparation method [8]. Microsatellite markers were selected from the poultry genetic consensus map [37] based on chromosomal locations and informativeness in each F0 sire family. The platform used for genotyping was developed at the Centre de Resources, Génotypage, Séquençage (CRGS) of Génopole Toulouse Midi-Pyrenées (INRA, Toulouse, France). Genotyping of the DNA samples employed 109 informative markers representing 20 autosomal linkage groups and was performed at Labogena (INRA Jouy-en-Josas, France). Fluorescent microsatellite analysis was performed on ABI 3700 DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each genotype was interpreted using both the GeneScan Analysis 3.7 and Genotyper Analysis 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The GEMMA database was used to manage the informativeness of the genotyping assays [38].Data reformatting The multi-allelic nature of microsatellite markers required formatting to determine the F0 line of origin of each marker. Using the F2 coding format from the R/qtl software [39], the genotype of each individual at each marker was coded as follows: AA (if the both alleles were inherited from HG grandparents), AB (if the alleles were derived from one HG and one LG grandparent), BB (if both alleles were inherited from two LG grandparents), not BB (if one allele was inherited from an HG parent and the origin of the other allele was indeterminate), not AA (if one allele was inherited from an LG parent and the origin of the other allele was indeterminate) and NA (if the line of origin could not be determined for either allele).Statistical analysis Yi et al.'s [18,21] Bayesian model selection method was used to simultaneously detect main effects and epistatic and gene-sex interactions using the R/qtlbim software [40]. Each chromosome was divided into one cM grids, resulting in 2410 possible loci across the chicken genome. These preset loci were considered as possible QTL positions. We placed an upper bound on the number of QTL included in the model for each trait. The upper bound was chosen based on the number of significant QTL detected in the traditional interval mapping [21]. Based on this, the prior number of main-effect QTL was set at lm and the prior for the expected number of all QTL was lm + 3. We simultaneously modelled main effects, QTL-QTL interactions and QTL-sex interactions. We fitted the models using R/qtlbim [40], which implements a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm [18,21]. The MCMC algorithm generates posterior samples from the joint posterior distribution of all parameters in the model, proceeding to draw each parameter from its conditional posterior distribution using the latest values of all other unknowns and the observed data. Each iteration of the MCMC algorithm cycles through all elements of the unknowns. This process was continued for many iterations in order to obtain random samples from the joint posterior distribution. For each analysis, the MCMC sampler was run for 1.2 × 105 iterations after the first 1000 iterations were discarded as burn-in. To reduce serial correlation in the stored samples, the chain was thinned by one in k = 40, yielding 3 × 103 samples for posterior analysis. Convergence diagnostics and mixing behavior assessed using graphical and numerical methods provided by R/qtlbim showed that the simulation chains converged and mixed well. The posterior inclusion probability for each locus was estimated as its frequency in the posterior samples. Each locus may be included in the model through its main effects and/or interactions with other loci (epistasis). The larger the effect size for a locus, the more frequently the locus was sampled. Taking the prior probability into consideration, we used the Bayes factor (BF) to show evidence for inclusion versus exclusion of a locus. The BF for a locus is defined as the ratio of the posterior odds to the prior odds for inclusion versus exclusion of the locus. A BF threshold of 3, or 2loge (BF) = 2.1, is taken as supporting a claim of significance [41]. The posterior inclusion probability and corresponding BFs of main effects, epistatic interactions and QTL-sex interactions were estimated separately. The proportions of the phenotypic variance explained by the genetic effect were estimated by its heritability.Authors' contributions GB carried out the QTL mapping analyses and drafted the manuscript.

While -amino acids clearly predominate in nature, amino acids are sometimes found in proteins that are not synthesized by ribosomes, and Ala and Glu are routinely found in the peptidoglycan cell wall of bacteria. Here, we review recent findings showing that amino acids have previously unappreciated regulatory roles in the bacterial kingdom. Many diverse bacterial phyla synthesize and release amino acids, including Met and Leu, which were not previously known to be made. These noncanonical amino acids regulate cell wall remodeling in stationary phase and cause biofilm dispersal in aging bacterial communities. Elucidating the mechanisms by which amino acids govern cell wall remodeling and biofilm disassembly will undoubtedly reveal new paradigms for understanding how extracytoplasmic processes are regulated as well as lead to development of novel therapeutics.

Introduction Objects are described as chiral if their reflected image in a mirror cannot be superimposed on the original. The term chiral is derived from the Greek word for hand, χειρ, as human hands provide a prime example of chirality. While very similar in almost all characteristics, the mirror image of a left hand—the right hand—cannot be superimposed on itself and interacts with other objects in a distinct manner [1]. Natural objects, such as vertebrate appendages, that exhibit chirality are readily apparent. Chirality is also widespread at the molecular level. Remarkably, in 1848 at the age of 25, before he carried out his pioneering studies in microbiology, the great French scientist Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) discovered molecular chirality in mirror-image tartaric acid crystals (revisited in [2]). Nine years later, while studying the fermentation of tartaric acid by microorganisms, Pasteur discovered that one mirror image of tartaric acid was consumed with greater preference over the other [2, 3]. In the ensuing 150 years, the great importance of molecular chirality in many biochemical processes has become clear. The two mirror images of a chiral molecule are referred to as optical isomers or enantiomers (from the Greek εχθρóς, “enemy”). Most physical properties of enantiomers are identical; however, they have distinct interactions with plane-polarized light. When plane-polarized light passes through a solution of chiral molecules, one enantiomer rotates the plane of polarization in a counterclockwise (left-hand) direction whereas the other enantiomer rotates the plane of polarization in a clockwise (right-hand) direction. In biological molecules, the most common basis of chirality is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups, which is termed a stereocenter (or chiral center). The three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms bound to a chiral center can be used to describe a molecule’s chirality. Different nomenclature systems have been developed to describe the chirality of molecules, but d- and l- prefixes are generally used for amino acids and sugars as described in [4]. The d/l nomenclature for amino acid configuration does not refer to the optical activity of the amino acid per se, but rather to the optical activity of the glyceraldehyde isomer that the amino acid can be overlayed upon. The structures of the l- and d-enantiomers of alanine are shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1 Chirality of alanine. Ball-and-sticks representation of the enantiomeric forms of the amino acid alanine. Carboxyl group is colored in red, amino group in blue, and R-group in yellow. Chiral carbon is labeled as α. The molecules were designed with ChemDraw Ultra 12.0 and Chem3D Pro 12.0 software While chemical synthesis routinely yields both enantiomers, most enzymes display marked substrate selectivity, and as a consequence many biochemical processes generally utilize and yield particular enantiomers. For example, l-amino acids are the predominant building blocks of proteins; d-amino acids cannot be incorporated into proteins via ribosomal synthesis. Similarly, nearly all naturally occurring monosaccharides exist as d-sugars. The origins of enantiospecificity in biological processes are unclear, but it has been proposed that enantiomerically enriched organic compounds were critical for the generation of proto-life forms [5–7]. Even though l-amino acids are the dominant substrates for ribosome-based protein synthesis, several roles for d-amino acids in other biological processes have been described. For example, d-aspartate is a major regulator of adult neurogenesis [8] and d-serine acts as a co-agonist of the N-methyl d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors in the brain, which are involved in learning, memory, and behavior in mammals [9–11]. d-serine is also the most abundant amino acid in human urine and alters gene expression of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) [12]. It was noted more than 50 years ago that, in addition to free amino acids, some peptides contain d-amino acids [13]. d-configured residues in peptides provide resistance to proteases, which generally exhibit specificity for l-amino acid-containing peptides, and also contribute to their bioactivity (listed in Tables 1, 2). d-amino acids are incorporated into the peptides via two different mechanisms. The first mechanism is posttranslational conversion of l- to d-amino acids within peptides that were originally synthesized in ribosomes. The second mechanism requires the activity of nonribosomal peptide (NRP) synthetases, which, unlike ribosomal peptide synthesis, generates peptides independent of messenger RNA. While posttranslational modification occurs primarily in eukaryotes, NRP synthesis is more frequent in bacteria. For example, dermorphin is an analgesic 1,000 times more potent than morphine [14, 15], achatin-I is an excitatory neurotransmitter [16–18], and gramicidines and tyrocidines have antimicrobial activity [19–23]. Considering that Tables 1 and 2 summarize most of the known examples in the literature, d-amino acid-containing peptides seem relatively unusual. However, peptides containing d-amino acids have probably been overlooked. Furthermore, there have been increasing numbers of reports on this subject in the last few decades suggesting that there are likely to be many more yet-to-be-discovered examples of d-amino acids in nature.Table 1 d-amino acids in eukaryotic peptidesPeptided-amino acid (position)SourceActivityReferenceDermorphind-Ala (2nd)Phyllomedusa sauvagei (skin secretions of Argentinian tree frog)Binds to μ-type opiate receptors and acts as an analgesic 1,000 times more powerful than morphine[14, 15]Deltorphinsd-Met or d-Ala (2nd)Phyllomedusa species (skin secretions)Binds to δ-type opiate receptors[107, 108]Bombinins and bombinins Hd-allo-Ile (2nd)Bombinatoridae (skin secretions of frogs)Antimicrobial and hemolytic activity[109–111]Achatin-Id-Phe (2nd)Achatina fulica (ganglia and atrium of African snail)Excitatory neurotransmitter controlling muscle contraction[16–18]Fucilind-Asn (2nd)A. fulica (ganglia of African snail)Excitatory neurotransmitter controlling penis contraction[112, 113]Contryphansd-Trp (3rd or 4th)Conus purpurascens and C. radiatus (venom of cone snail)Causes tremor and mucous secretions when injected into fish[114–116]d-Leu (5th)FRF amide familyd-Leu (2nd)BivalvesStimulates muscle contraction[117]Crustacean hyperglycemic hormoned-Phe (3rd)Decapod crustaceansNeurohormone controlling hyperglycemia[118, 119]ω-Agatoxin-IVBd-Ser (46th)Agelenopsis aperta (venom of funnel-web spider)Blocks voltage-sensitive calcium channels[120, 121]Paecilodepsipeptide AThree d-amino acid residues including an unusual O-prenyl-d-TyrInsect pathogenic fungus Paecilomyces cinnamomeus BCC 9616Activity against the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum K1; cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines (KB and BC)[122]Table 2 d-amino acids in bacterial peptidesPeptided-amino acid (position)SourceActivityReferenceGramicidine Sd-Phe (4th, 9th)Bacillus brevis (antimicrobial peptides)Membrane disruption of lipid bilayer[19, 20]Gramicidine Dd-Leu (4th, 10th, 12th, 14th)B. brevis (antimicrobial peptides)Permeabilizes lipid membranes by forming ion channels that disrupt ion gradient[20, 21]d-Val (6th, 8th)Tyrocidinesd-Phe (1st)B. brevis (antimicrobial peptides)Permeabilizes lipid membranes[22, 23]d-Phe or d-Tyr (4th)Daptomycin (Cubicin)d-Ala (8th)Streptomycetes (S. roseosporus)Bactericidal activity[123–125]LipopeptidolactonesArthrofactin (7 d-amino acids of the 11) Pseudomonas strainsBiosurfactants[126–132]Syringomycin (2 d-amino acids of the 9) Syringopeptin (about 70% of the sequence is in d-configuration)DD-diketopiperazinesOnly d-amino acidsBacterial strains CF-20 (CECT5719) and C-148 (CECT5718), isolated from cultures of larvae of mollusksStrong antibiotic activity against Vibrio anguillarum[133]Gassericin A1 d-Ala residueLactobacillus gasseri LA39Antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and S. aureus[134–136] Besides being occasionally incorporated in peptides, d-amino acids have been known to be utilized as nutrients to support bacterial growth [24–27], to regulate bacterial spore germination, and to be components of the bacterial cell wall. We briefly summarize the latter two previously recognized roles of d-amino acids below. Then, we discuss recent findings showing that d-amino acids have previously unappreciated regulatory roles in the bacterial kingdom.d-amino acids and bacterial spore germination Bacterial sporulation is an adaptive response to environmental stress, such as starvation, and involves a finely controlled developmental program. Initiation of sporulation leads to asymmetric cell division producing a mother cell and forespore with distinct cell fates. The forespore develops into the spore, whereas the mother cell nurtures the spore but ultimately lyses through programmed cell death [28]. Bacterial spores are metabolically dormant and resistant to a number of harsh environments including heat, radiation, desiccation, pH extremes, and toxic chemicals [29]. This remarkable resistance is provided by a tough multilayered cell wall [30]. In the presence of specific germinants such as l-alanine or other nutrients, spores can reactivate metabolism and grow vegetatively. In 1949, it was discovered that d-alanine was a potent inhibitor of spore germination in many Bacillus species [31]. Subsequent work since this discovery has revealed that Bacillus species utilize d-alanine as an auto-inhibitor of spore germination at high spore density. This activity is mediated through expression of an alanine racemase in the spore exosporium that converts a spore germinant (l-Ala) to an anti-germinant (d-Ala) [32]. A nutrient receptor is responsible for recognition of l-Ala, and it has been suggested that d-Ala antagonizes l-Ala binding to this receptor [33]. Presumably, this mechanism of auto-inhibition is an evolutionary adaptation to prevent premature germination under low nutrient conditions and high population density, an environmental condition that would lead to rapid nutrient depletion and cell death. Recent work has also suggested that d-Ala alters the kinetics of germination in vivo to enhance the efficiency and timing of infection [34]. d-His has also been implicated as a germination inhibitor of Bacillusanthracis infection in murine macrophages [35], however its mechanism of action and whether it is physiologically produced by B.anthracis is unknown.d-amino acids in peptidoglycan Bacteria have a formidable ability to withstand many physical, chemical, and biological insults. In large part, this is due to the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall, which imparts to the cell its shape, strength, and resistance to osmotic pressure [36–38]. PG also serves as a scaffold for anchoring other cell envelope components [39, 40]. PG (also known as murein) is found on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane of almost all bacteria [36, 41, 42]. It is a strong yet flexible net-like polymer composed of linear glycan strands made up of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) cross-linked by short peptides (Fig. 2). PG is essential for cell viability and therefore its synthesis and turnover must be tightly controlled; otherwise, the mechanical stability of the cell wall and cell integrity would be compromised. In gram-negative bacteria, a single layer of PG, which is found in the periplasmic space between the inner and outer cell membranes, is sufficient to maintain the cell’s mechanical stability [43]. In gram-positive bacteria, which lack an outer cell membrane, the cell wall is thicker, consisting of many layers of PG.Fig. 2 Biosynthesis of peptidoglycan (PG). General scheme of PG synthesis in gram negative bacteria. PG synthesis is initiated with the synthesis of the disaccharide pentapeptide precursors in the cytosol (GlcNAc-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu-DAP-d-Ala-d-Ala) [42]. Then, PG precursors are translocated to the periplasmic space facilitated by the formation of lipidic complexes with bactoprenol [43, 44]. Once in the periplasm, PG monomers are incorporated into the murein polymer by transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions carried out by the activity of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) [45–48]. Also PBP activities (murein hydrolases) can affect the length of the stem peptides, depicted as d-Ala between brackets [43]. IM Inner membrane, OM outer membrane The biosynthesis of PG is divided into three stages (Fig. 2). In the first step, the PG precursors nucleotide sugar-linked UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and UDP-GlcNAc are synthesized in the cytoplasm [44]. Second, lipid intermediates of these precursors are formed by transferring the phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide moiety of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide to the membrane acceptor bactoprenyl-P, yielding lipid I. Subsequently, GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc is added to lipid I, yielding lipid II. The lipid II intermediate enables the cell to transport the hydrophilic precursors from the aqueous environment of the cytoplasm through the hydrophobic membrane, where they can act as substrates for incorporation into the PG polymer [45, 46]. PG polymerization, the third stage of PG biosynthesis, occurs outside of the cell membrane in the periplasmic space of gram-negative bacteria and outside the cell entirely in gram-positive organisms. Polymerization is carried out by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). These enzymes catalyze both the transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions required to incorporate new muropeptides into the PG polymer [47–50]. One of the most striking features of PG composition is the presence of d-amino acids in the stem peptides (Fig. 2) [51]. d-amino acids contribute to the architecture of the murein and, more importantly, provide resistance to most known proteases. Thus, the presence of d-amino acids in PG likely constitutes a bacterial adaptation to protect a vital cellular structure. d-Ala and d-Glu are by far the most common d-amino acids present in the bacterial cell wall; however, the PG of some bacteria include other d-amino acids, such as d-Asp in Lactococcus [52] and Enterococcus [53], and d-Ser in vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [54–56]. In some cases, such substitutions enable bacteria to tolerate bactericidal agents from the environment [57].Production of d-amino acids Since l-amino acids are the predominant amino acids found in living organisms, typically they act as the substrate for generation of d-amino acids. l- to d-conversion occurs by the action of racemases that change the stereochemistry of the chiral α-carbon atom in amino acids [58]. Amino acid racemases are classified into two groups, pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent and PLP-independent enzymes, with distinct reaction mechanisms.PLP-dependent amino acid racemasesAlanine racemases Alanine racemases use a PLP-dependent mechanism to deprotonate the α-carbon of alanine. Reprotonation of the α-carbon on the opposite side generates the antipodal amino acid (Fig. 3a). In the racemase molecule, PLP is bound to a Lys residue to form an internal Schiff base. The substrate alanine molecule reacts with PLP by transaldimination to form an external Schiff base. Abstraction of the α-hydrogen of the substrate amino acid moiety of the Schiff base generates an anionic form that is stabilized as a quinoid intermediate with the PLP moiety (Fig. 3c). This intermediate is subsequently protonated and releases the antipodal form of alanine through a second transaldimination reaction with the same Lys residue involved in the initial reaction, thus regenerating the enzyme (Fig. 3c) [59]. One- and two-base reaction mechanisms have been proposed for the abstraction/addition of the α-hydrogen. In the former the α-hydrogen of both isomers is abstracted and added with a single catalytic residue (Lys). In the latter the α-hydrogen of either d-alanine or l-alanine is abstracted and added by a different catalytic residue (Tyr and Lys, respectively). Although the two-base mechanism is more probable, further experimentation is under way to show this conclusively [60].Fig. 3 Mechanism of amino acid racemase reactions. a PLP-dependent alanine racemase (AlaRac) and b PLP-independent glutamate racemase (GluRac) reactions are depicted showing the amino acidic residues of the enzymes that participate in the stereochemical transformation of alanine and glutamic acid, respectively. The achiral anionic quinoid intermediate is shown in brackets. c Schematic of the catalytic mechanism of the PLP-dependent alanine racemase reaction. The molecules were designed with ChemDraw Ultra 12.0 software Most bacteria encode two different alanine racemases, DadB and Alr. While both racemases use the same reaction mechanism, they are components of distinct molecular pathways. DadB participates in l-Ala catabolism, producing d-Ala to be used as a substrate to form pyruvate via a d-Ala dehydrogenase. In contrast, Alr generates the d-Ala that is utilized in formation of muropeptide precursors for PG synthesis [61, 62].Serine racemase Bacterial serine racemases are homologues of alanine racemases and play an important role in resistance to vancomycin [54, 56], a glycopeptide antibiotic that inhibits PG synthesis by binding to the d-Ala-d-Ala moiety in muropeptide precursors. In enterococci, vancomycin resistance arises through modification of the vancomycin target site from d-Ala-d-Ala to either d-Ala-d-lactate or d-Ala-d-Ser [63]. d-Ser is generated from l-Ser by VanT, a serine racemase, which, like alanine racemase, is also PLP-dependent and probably uses a two-base catalyzed reaction. The similarity of VanT to alanine racemase suggests that the two enzymes share a common evolutionary history [64].PLP-independent amino acid racemasesGlutamate racemase Like d-Ala, d-Glu is a component of the PG cell wall in bacteria, but this d-amino acid is produced by a PLP-independent racemase. Similar to alanine racemases, glutamate racemases are thought to follow a two-base mechanism, however, two cysteines have been suggested to be involved in the catalysis of the latter [65–67] (Fig. 3b). In some organisms, such as E. coli, expression of glutamate racemase is activated 100-fold in the presence of UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala. This intermediate is ligated to d-Glu in generating PG precursor units, lipid I and lipid II. Thus, expression of the glutamate racemase is regulated by the factors that require its presence [68, 69]. Bacillus subtilis encodes two glutamate racemases, Glr and YrpC. Though both proteins have similar biochemical properties, Glr is mainly involved in d-glutamate synthesis for poly-γ-d-glutamate, a structural component of the spore capsule, whereas YrpC is the racemase that creates d-Glu for the cell wall PG [70, 71].Aspartate and proline racemases d-Asp occurs in the PG layer of some bacterial cell walls and is produced from l-Asp by an aspartate racemase. The enzyme is present in various gram-positive bacteria, including Lactococcus lactis [52], Enterococcus faecium [53], Lactobacillus fermenti [72], and Streptococcus faecalis [73], as well as some archea [74]. Like glutamate racemase, aspartate racemase requires no cofactors, contains an essential cysteine residue, and has been proposed to act via a two-base mechanism to remove and return the α-proton of the substrate [75]. Proline racemase is also a member of the PLP-independent enzyme family. Proline racemases have been identified in Clostridium difficile and Clostridium sticklandii. Currently, it is not known if d-Pro is a component of PG in these spore-forming organisms, but it has been hypothesized that d-Pro may enable these pathogens to evade the host immune response [76].Newly appreciated regulatory roles for d-amino acids in bacteria As outlined above, the roles of d-amino acids in bacteria were thought to be fairly limited. However, recently it has become clear that d-amino acids are synthesized and released by bacteria from diverse phyla, at up to millimolar concentrations [77]. Furthermore, released d-amino acids function to regulate cell wall chemistry and architecture as well as biofilm development in bacteria [78]. These findings and their implications are discussed below.d-amino acids govern cell wall remodeling in bacteria Although PG functions as an exoskeleton, bacterial growth and survival depends on PG plasticity [41, 42, 79]. When bacteria grow, covalent bonds in the PG polymer must be cleaved by murein hydrolases and new bonds formed to insert new subunits into the sacculus. Furthermore, new PG synthesis is crucial for the formation of the septum during cell division (with subsequent generation of the new poles in the daughter cells) [80] and for sporulation/germination PG remodeling [29, 81, 82]. Finally, in times of stress, PG also can be remodeled. For example, many rod-shaped bacteria reorganize their PG in stationary phase, becoming smaller and more coccoid in shape [83]. Currently, there is relatively little understanding of the factors that govern PG remodeling during exponential growth; however, d-amino acids were recently shown to control changes in PG composition and architecture as cells enter stationary phase (see below). More than six decades ago, high concentrations of exogenous d-amino acids were found to inhibit bacterial growth [84–86]. This effect, which was attributed to alterations in PG metabolism in the treated cells [87–90], required addition of seemingly nonphysiological levels of amino acids, and hence was not thought to be biologically meaningful; however, it did inspire the use of exogenously added components to investigate murein segregation. De Pedro and colleagues demonstrated that low concentrations of d-Cys were relatively innocuous to cells but that several bacterial species incorporated this sulfhydryl-bearing amino acid into murein [89, 90]. Immunodetection of the -SH groups in purified sacculi enabled the distribution of d-Cys in PG to be tracked [91], and such studies have provided valuable insights into cell growth, polarity, and PG synthesis and maintenance [92, 93].Discovery of production and release of d-amino acids by bacteria Our group recently made the unexpected discovery that many diverse phyla of bacteria produce types of d-amino acids that were not previously known to be synthesized and release them into the environment [77]. We made this surprising finding while investigating the genetic basis for the curved rod-shape of Vibrio cholerae, the gram-negative bacterium that causes cholera. A genetic screen for V. cholerae with altered cell shape yielded a mutant that exhibited a growth phase-dependent cell morphology defect. We observed that nearly all mrcA mutant cells in stationary phase cultures were spherical, although their morphology did not differ from that of wild-type cells during exponential growth. The mrcA gene encodes PBP1A, an inner membrane-anchored enzyme that elongates the glycan chains and establishes the cross-links between the peptides of the PG [37]. Thus, PBP1A-mediated PG synthesis appears to be required for the maintenance of V. cholerae rod shape in stationary phase. In contrast, deletion of mrcB, which encodes PBP1B, had no effect on V. cholerae morphology suggesting that these two homologous enzymes have clearly separable functions [77]. We hypothesized that the rod-to-sphere transition of the mrcA cells might be stimulated by an extracellular factor present in stationary phase supernatants, since the morphology of mrcA cells changed as cultures became saturated and entered stationary phase. In fact, exponentially growing rod-shaped mrcA cells rapidly became spherical when incubated in a cell-free supernatant from stationary phase cultures. We purified the sphere-inducing component and identified that the active factors were four amino acids: Met, Leu, Val, and Ile. The d- rather than l-forms of these particular amino acids were the active agents in V. cholerae supernatants that influenced mrcA’s morphology. Remarkably, stationary phase V. cholerae supernatants contained a ~1 mM total concentration of these four d-amino acids, an amount sufficient to account for the sphere-inducing activity in the supernatants. Except for d-Pro and d-Gln, other d-amino acids also had some capacity to stimulate the mrcA mutant’s shape transition from rod to sphere, suggesting that sphere-inducing activity is promoted by the chirality rather than the side chain of the amino acid [77].BsrV racemase Genomic analysis allowed us to identify a novel V. cholerae racemase that proved to be necessary and sufficient for the synthesis of the unusual d-amino acids in V. cholerae supernatants. Besides the two genes that encode the V. cholerae Glu and Ala racemases, the V.cholerae genome contains an additional gene (vc1312) that encodes a putative PLP-dependent amino acid racemase. A strain with a deletion of this gene was highly defective in the production of d-Met, d-Leu, d-Val, and d-Ile, suggesting that it encodes the principal racemase for the generation of these four d-amino acids. This enzyme, which was named broad spectrum racemase in Vibrio (BsrV) also exhibits in vitro racemase activity for these d-amino acids confirming BsrV as a broad spectrum racemase [77]. Since extracellular d-amino acids were not detected in supernatants from exponential phase cultures of wild-type cells, BsrV is likely only active during stationary phase. In addition, unlike nearly all other bacterial amino acid racemases, which are cytoplasmic, the BsrV racemase was found exclusively in the periplasm, suggesting that d-amino acids produced by BsrV primarily act on periplasmic targets [77]. Notably, we found that the release of d-amino acids into the media is not limited to V. cholerae and other vibrios; instead, stationary phase supernatants from many species representing diverse phyla including B. subtilis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Deinococcus radiodurans contained different d-amino acids. Consistent with this observation, most bacterial genomes appear to encode one or more amino acid racemases in addition to the enzymes required to generate d-Ala and d-Glu for PG synthesis [77]. This suggests that production of broad spectrum racemases may be a conserved trait amongst diverse bacteria.d-amino acids regulate peptidoglycan composition, amount, and strength Even though the morphology of wild-type cells was not altered by d-amino acids, we hypothesized that the production of d-amino acids by wild-type V. cholerae has an important physiological role since their generation represents a significant metabolic expenditure. Several observations supported the idea that release of noncanonical d-amino acids could regulate cell wall remodeling. First, d-amino acids (principally d-Ala and d-Glu) are known to be cell wall components, and thus it seemed reasonable that additional d-amino acids could influence PG metabolism. Second, we observed that wild-type V. cholerae cells became spherical if d-amino acids were supplemented with β-lactam antibiotics. Since PG is the principal determinant of bacterial cell shape, these observations suggested that d-amino acids in combination with either genetic (e.g., deletion of mrcA) or chemical inactivation of PBPs lead to weakened PG that is unable to maintain V. cholerae’s rod shape. Finally, as mentioned above, previous work by de Pedro and colleagues revealed that exogenous d-Cys or d-Met could (at high concentrations) be incorporated into PG [89–91, 94]. We compared the chemical composition, structure, and amount of PG isolated from stationary phase wild-type and bsrV V. cholerae to ascertain the effects of the physiologic production of d-amino acids on PG metabolism. Remarkably, the bsrV mutant, which fails to produce and release significant amounts of d-Met, d-Leu, d-Val, and d-Ile, but still produces d-Ala and d-Glu, contained twice the amount of PG found in wild-type cells in stationary phase. Furthermore, exogenous addition of d-amino acids reduced the amount of PG in V. cholerae. Thus, d-amino acids negatively regulate the amount of PG produced by V. cholerae in stationary phase. Moreover, because the accumulation of d-amino acids coincides with the transition into stationary phase and appears to downregulate PG synthesis, d-amino acids may enable coordination of metabolic slowing in cell wall and cytoplasmic compartments when resources become scarce [77]. The noncanonical d-amino acids are incorporated into the PG polymer. HPLC-based analyses of muropeptides from wild-type cells demonstrated that d-Met and d-Leu were present in PG in stationary phase. d-Met and d-Leu replaced d-Ala in the fourth position of the peptide bridge in 3–4% of the stationary phase muropeptides but were not detected in PG from the bsrV mutant. As previously suggested for the incorporation of exogenous d-amino acid into the PG [94], the incorporation of physiologically released d-Met and d-Leu may occur via the action of a periplasmic, β-lactam-insensitive PG-modifying enzyme. BsrV-generated d-amino acids also influenced the structure of stationary phase PG. In comparison to wild-type PG, the glycan chains from the bsrV mutant were ~20% shorter, and there was an approximately 50% reduction in the amount of full-length pentapeptides and an increase in the amount of trimer muropeptides. Importantly, the changes in PG structure and abundance in the bsrV mutant appear to reduce PG strength. Wild-type cells were far more resistant to an osmotic challenge, suggesting that the PG in wild-type cells is stronger than that in the bsrV mutant. The osmotic hypersensitivity of bsrV mutant cells was unexpected since the bsrV mutant cells contain twice as much PG as wild-type cells. The “weakness” of the PG in bsrV cells presumably is a consequence of the alterations in cell wall structure that result from the absence of d-amino acids in these cells. In this regard, variations in the proportions of pentapeptides and tetrapeptides should have little, if any, effect on the physical strength of the sacculus (as these peptides do not participate in bridging). However, the decrease in the length of the glycan strands in the bsrV mutant could weaken the PG because the number of covalent bonds closing the net-like peptidoglycan molecule is reduced. Regardless of the chemical changes that weaken the PG in the bsrV mutant, general weakening of the entire sacculus is not required to bestow osmotic sensitivity, only localized weakening of the PG would be sufficient. Together, these observations suggest that d-amino acid production by BsrV as cells enter stationary phase provides an autocrine-like signal for V. cholerae to remodel its PG and decrease PG synthesis in adaptation to stationary phase conditions [77]. Regulation of PG by d-amino acids is not limited to V. cholerae. We found that B. subtilis produces different d-amino acids than does V. cholerae (mainly d-Phe and d-Tyr) in stationary phase, but these d-amino acids appear to influence PG synthesis and chemistry in similar ways as d-Met and d-Leu in V. cholerae. Thus, evolutionarily distant bacteria have a common strategy to modulate PG synthesis in stationary phase through production and release of d-amino acids. Remarkably, B. subtilis growth was inhibited when cultured in the presence of exogenous physiologic concentrations of d-amino acids produced by B. subtilis in stationary phase. This suggests that d-amino acids may be a mechanism to simultaneously slow down growth and PG synthesis as population density becomes saturating. Finally, we also found that exogenous physiologic concentrations of d-Met that are produced by V. cholerae were incorporated into E. coli PG at the same position in the peptide bridge. Thus, E. coli is capable of incorporating noncanonical d-amino acid into its murein sacculus even though this bacterium does not produce or release noncanonical d-amino acids. Therefore, d-amino acids can also act as paracrine-like effectors to influence PG physiology in species other than those that produce them.Mechanisms of d-amino acid cell wall regulation Exactly how d-amino acid-dependent cell wall remodeling occurs remains to be determined. Incorporation of unusual d-amino acids (such as d-Met or d-Leu) into the PG polymer could modulate the strength and flexibility of this polymer (Fig. 4). Furthermore, PBPs and other enzymes that modify PG may have altered affinity for and activity on d-amino acid-modified muropeptides. However, it is unlikely that all of the differences in PG composition, structure, and amount observed between V. cholerae wild-type and bsrV mutant strains can be solely attributed to the incorporation of d-amino acids into PG. Supporting this idea, we found that 2.0 mM d-Ala stimulated the conversion of rod-shaped mrcA cells to spheres, even though d-Ala is already present at the site where d-Met or d-Leu is incorporated. Thus, d-Ala, and presumably other d-amino acids, have effects that are not merely consequences of their incorporation into PG. In this regard, d-amino acids likely regulate the periplasmic enzymes that synthesize and modify the PG polymer. We found that d- but not l-Met blocks the binding of a fluorescent derivative of penicillin G to several V. cholerae PBPs [77]. This result suggests that free amino acids accumulated in the periplasm might compete with muropeptide moieties for PBP active sites, thereby serving as regulators of PBP activity. While the exact identity of these PBPs remains to be determined, this observation suggests that d-amino acids may be direct modulators of PBP activity under stationary phase conditions. Further genetic and biochemical analyses of d-amino acid targets are necessary to define the mechanism(s) of d-amino acid action on cell wall PG.Fig. 4 Model of PG remodeling governed by d-amino acid release in stationary phase. PG in V.cholerae is composed of linear glycan strands made up of repeating disaccharide units of GlcNAc and MurNAc cross-linked by short peptides that consist of l-Ala, d-Glu, meso-diaminopimelic acid (m-DAP), and d-Ala. In stationary phase, d-Met (bluecircles) and d-Leu (redcircles) are produced by BsrV, a periplasmic racemase. These d-amino acids (1) are incorporated at the 4th position of the PG-peptide bridge where d-Ala is usually found, (2) regulate the activity of periplasmic enzymes including penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which synthesize and modify PG, and (3) are released into the extracellular milieu where d-amino acids regulate the PG of other bacteria. OM Outer membrane, IM inner membrane Consistent with reports in other bacterial species [95, 96], we observed additive effects of exogenous d-amino acids in combination with β-lactam antibiotics on wild-type V. cholerae shape and growth. For example, the combination of d-Met with the cephalosporin cefmetazole or the monobactam aztreonam caused wild-type V. cholerae to become spherical (similar to stationary V. cholerae mrcA), whereas when added independently, only minor morphological changes were induced. These observations support the idea that d-amino acids exert regulatory effects on PG-modifying enzymes.The challenge of regulating PG composition, amount, and structure Regulation of PG amount, chemistry, and architecture constitutes a particularly challenging issue for the bacterial cell. This complex polymer as well as the enzymes that assemble and modify it are located beyond the cytoplasmic membrane and thus outside of the carefully controlled milieu of the cytoplasm. d-amino acid production by BsrV in the periplasmic space enables the cell to produce d-amino acids in the cell compartment (the periplasm) where they will act. d-amino acid incorporation into the pre-existing PG polymer in the periplasm can be thought of as cell wall “editing.” Such post-synthetic regulation of PG is analogous to posttranslational modification of proteins by glycosylation and to methylation of DNA, processes that alter the properties/activities of other biopolymers. It is likely that incorporation of noncanonical d-amino acids into PG alters the polymers’ physical properties as well as influences the ability of d-amino acid-modified PG to serve as a substrate for periplasmic PG-modifying enzymes. Controlling the concentration of d-amino acids in the periplasm could constitute a reversible mechanism for inhibiting PBPs, thereby enabling cells to rapidly transition between states of active and inactive PG metabolism under changing environmental conditions.d-amino acids coordinate cell wall metabolism in bacterial populations Our work has revealed that noncanonical d-amino acids regulate cell wall metabolism. Because the accumulation of d-amino acids coincides with the transition into stationary phase and appears to downregulate PG synthesis, d-amino acids may couple metabolic slowing in cell wall and cytoplasmic compartments under conditions of stress. Additionally, rapid diffusion of small molecule regulators like d-amino acids in aqueous environments enables a quick and synchronized response from the whole bacterial population. In times of scarce nutrients (and potentially additional undefined cellular stresses) the release of extracellular d-amino acids can signal to the whole population to regulate PG amount, composition, and strength. This mechanism may be crucial in nutrient-depleted environments where secretion of secondary metabolites such as organic acids, antibiotics, or small lipids can put the integrity of the cell at risk. Finally, since bacteria are more likely to grow in polymicrobial communities than in monoculture, d-amino acid control may mediate interspecies regulation among bacteria or other organisms that occupy the same niche. It remains to be seen whether d-amino acids mediate both mutualistic and competitive behaviors among different bacteria that share a niche.d-amino acids control biofilm dispersal Many bacteria are able to switch between two different “lifestyles.” They can exist as either single (planktonic) cells or in communities known as biofilms. A biofilm is defined as a sessile microbial community that adheres to a solid surface and is surrounded by a bacterially produced extracellular matrix. This matrix is typically composed of polysaccharides, but it can also include proteins and/or DNA. The transition between planktonic and biofilm growth is regulated by a variety of environmental and physiological cues, including bacterial cell density, nutrient availability, and cellular stress [97, 98]. Biofilms are prevalent both in natural environments and in industrial and hospital settings [99–105]. Bacterial infections associated with biofilms adherent to medical devices, such as intravascular catheters, are extremely difficult to eradicate, as the extracellular matrices protect biofilm-associated bacteria from antimicrobials and the host immune system. Thus, discovery of new agents to prevent biofilm formation and/or disrupt established biofilms is of considerable interest. B. subtilis forms biofilms that can be visualized in the laboratory as pellicles at the liquid-to-surface interface of standing cultures or on semi-solid agar plates. Biofilms on standing cultures begin to disassemble after ~6–8 days, and Losick and colleagues recently reported that dissolution is induced by a mixture of d-amino acids (d-Leu, d-Met, d-Trp, and d-Tyr) produced by B. subtilis in these biofilms [78]. In these experiments, d-amino acid accumulation was found to be restricted to mature biofilms (6–8 days) and to be produced at least in part by the racemases YlmE and RacX. However, exogenous addition of d-amino acids to standing cultures prevented B. subtilis biofilm formation altogether. Individually, d-Tyr showed the highest potency, but the mixture of all four amino acids was more potent and had a minimum inhibitory concentration of ~10 nM. In contrast, a mixture of the corresponding l-amino acids neither inhibited biofilm formation nor disrupted existing biofilms [78]. Koldkin-Gal et al. hypothesized that d-amino acid production signals for biofilm disassembly by B. subtilis under conditions when nutrients have become limiting and metabolic waste products have accumulated, so escape into a planktonic lifestyle is therefore beneficial (Fig. 5).Fig. 5 Model of biofilm life cycle. B. subtilis cells associated in biofilm communities produce d-amino acids (d-Tyr, d-Met, d-Trp, and d-Leu represented with coloredcircles), which accumulate and trigger biofilm dispersal The mechanisms of d-amino acid-regulated biofilm dispersal are being dissected. Koldkin-Gal et al. [78] showed that d-amino acids can induce the disassembly of matrix-associated amyloid fibers that link B. subtilis cells within the biofilm. Maintenance of these fibers seems likely to contribute to biofilm durability, since mutants that could form biofilms in the presence of d-amino acids contained alterations within yqxM, whose gene product is required for attachment of amyloid fibers to the cell. However, it is likely that disruption of amyloid networks is not the only means by which d-amino acids promote biofilm disassembly, since Koldkin-Gal et al. found that d-amino acids led to biofilm dispersal in additional bacterial species, such as S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, that are not known to produce biofilm matrix-associated amyloid fibers. Thus, a universal mechanism of biofilm dispersal is unlikely. Regardless of the mechanism(s) by which d-amino acids promote biofilm dispersal, use of d-amino acids to combat biofilm-associated infections holds considerable promise, especially since d-amino acids are likely to have favorable pharmacokinetic properties and to lack significant toxicity [106].Conclusions and perspectives for future studies Recent studies have revealed two exciting and unexpected findings regarding d-amino acids in the bacterial kingdom. First, highly diverse bacteria release various d-amino acids into the environment. And second, the released d-amino acids have heretofore unappreciated roles in regulating key processes, including controlling stationary phase cell wall remodeling and biofilm disassembly in aging bacterial communities. Thus, d-amino acids are signaling molecules that control processes that occur at high cell densities, probably when nutrients become limited. However, the conditions that stimulate d-amino acid production have not been thoroughly explored; additional research is needed to define the stimuli that promote the expression and activity of the racemases that generate d-amino acids. d-amino acid signaling can be regarded as both autocrine and paracrine in nature since released d-amino acids act on both the cells that release them as well as neighboring cells. In many cases, neighboring cells are of the identical bacterial species as the cells that produced them, but d-amino acids can also act on nearby cells that are of different species. For example, we found that d-Met or d-Leu could be incorporated into the PG of E. coli [77]. In addition, in nature, biofilms are thought to often consist of more than one species [106]. Therefore, released d-amino acids in mixed biofilms may be a paracrine signal, which, along with other chemical regulators, control the architecture of the bacterial community. d-amino acids may be considered as a “chemical language” akin to quorum-sensing molecules, such as acyl homoserine-lactones, that mediate interspecies communication. It remains to be seen whether different d-amino acids mediate distinct types of signals in mixed communities. For example, d-Tyr may primarily function as a signal for biofilm disassembly, whereas d-Met may primarily promote cell wall remodeling. Furthermore, d-amino acids are likely mediators of more traditional types of signaling that regulate gene expression, such as the altered gene expression of UPEC by d-serine in human urine [12]. Many intriguing questions/issues regarding the regulatory roles of d-amino acids in bacterial biology remain to be addressed. Elucidating the mechanisms by which d-amino acids govern cell wall remodeling and biofilm disassembly will undoubtedly reveal new paradigms for understanding how processes outside of the cell membrane are controlled. Finally, application of the regulatory roles of d-amino acids to solve environmental and clinical problems has considerable promise.

Kessler			M110.211110				Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is regulated by dual pathways involving oxygen-dependent prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation of its α-subunits. Prolyl hydroxylation at two sites within a central degradation domain promotes association of HIF-α with the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitin E3 ligase and destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Asparaginyl hydroxylation blocks the recruitment of p300/CBP co-activators to a C-terminal activation domain in HIF-α. These hydroxylations are catalyzed by members of the Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) oxygenase family. Activity of the enzymes is suppressed by hypoxia, increasing both the abundance and activity of the HIF transcriptional complex. We have used hydroxy residue-specific antibodies to compare and contrast the regulation of each site of prolyl hydroxylation (Pro402, Pro564) with that of asparaginyl hydroxylation (Asn803) in human HIF-1α. Our findings reveal striking differences in the sensitivity of these hydroxylations to hypoxia and to different inhibitor types of 2-OG oxygenases. Hydroxylation at the three sites in endogenous human HIF-1α proteins was suppressed by hypoxia in the order Pro402 > Pro564 > Asn803. In contrast to some predictions from studies, prolyl hydroxylation was substantially more sensitive than asparaginyl hydroxylation to inhibition by iron chelators and transition metal ions; studies of a range of different small molecule 2-OG analogues demonstrated the feasibility of selectively inhibiting either prolyl or asparaginyl hydroxylation within cells.

Introduction Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)2 is the major transcriptional regulator of responses to hypoxia in metazoan cells. The HIF transcriptional complex binds DNA as an α/β heterodimer and is centrally involved in many homeostatic responses to hypoxia, including regulation of angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, energy metabolism, and cell growth and survival pathways (reviewed in Refs. 1–3). Regulation by oxygen availability is transduced by the HIF-α subunits through two distinct oxygen-dependent pathways; regulation of HIF-α protein stability and regulation of HIF-α transcriptional activation, mediated by prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation, respectively (for review, see Ref. 4). Human HIF-α exists as three isoforms, the two best characterized of which (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) each contain two sites of prolyl hydroxylation and a single site of asparaginyl hydroxylation. HIF-α prolyl hydroxylation occurs at two sites lying in the N-terminal (NODD) and C-terminal (CODD) regions of a central oxygen-dependent degradation domain; residues Pro402 and Pro564 in human HIF-1α (5–7). HIF-α asparaginyl hydroxylation occurs in the C-terminal activation domain; residue Asn803 occurs in human HIF-1α (8). HIF-α prolyl hydroxylation promotes interaction with the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitin E3 ligase complex and targets HIF-α subunits for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (9, 10). HIF-α asparaginyl hydroxylation interferes with the binding of p300/CBP co-activators to the C-terminal activation domain and thus inhibits transcriptional activation, independently of effects on protein stability (11). HIF prolyl hydroxylation is catalyzed by three closely related enzymes PHD (prolyl hydroxylase domain) 1, 2, and 3, otherwise known as EGLN2, -1, and -3 (12, 13), whereas HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation is catalyzed by FIH (factor inhibiting HIF) (14, 15). Both PHDs and FIH are Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-OG oxygenases) that utilize molecular oxygen as a co-substrate, and couple hydroxylation of HIF-α to the oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) and carbon dioxide (for review, see Refs. 16 and 17). This provides a dual control system whereby in the presence of oxygen HIF-α subunits are both inactivated and destroyed, whereas in hypoxia catalysis of these hydroxylations is suppressed, enabling HIF-α subunits to escape von Hippel-Lindau-mediated proteolysis, recruit co-activators, and form a productive transcriptional complex. This action of hypoxia can be partially mimicked by a number of agents that inhibit 2-OG oxygenases including iron chelators, transition metal ions, and small molecule 2-OG analogues. There is widespread interest in the possibility of developing HIF hydroxylase inhibitors that activate HIF pathways therapeutically in ischemic/hypoxic disease (18–20). In understanding the regulation of the transcriptional response by hypoxia and its potential manipulation by such agents, it is therefore important to understand the extent to which prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation of HIF-α are differentially inhibited by hypoxia and hydroxylase inhibitors. Several studies have characterized the in vitro kinetic properties of the PHDs and FIH using full-length or truncated recombinant proteins and have reported differences in kinetics with respect to oxygen, iron, and small molecule inhibitors. In some studies, a lower apparent Km for oxygen has been reported for FIH than the PHDs (21, 22). However extrapolation from these studies is not straightforward. For instance, it has been shown that the apparent Km for oxygen can depend on the HIF-α polypeptide used as the prime substrate and no studies have used full-length HIF-α polypeptide (23, 24). Furthermore, the existence of many known and postulated alternative substrates for FIH and the PHDs, together with difficulty in measuring concentrations of the enzymes in the relevant cellular compartments make it extremely difficult to predict, from these in vitro measurements, how oxygen availability might restrict catalysis in vivo. We have therefore developed methods employing hydroxy residue-specific antibodies to monitor the regulation of hydroxylation at all three sites in human HIF-1α. Previous studies using hydroxy residue-specific antibodies have described important differences in the regulation of the two sites of prolyl hydroxylation in HIF-1α (25) but to date there have been no studies of the differential regulation of prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation. Here we report the results of utilizing highly specific antibodies recognizing all three sites of hydroxylation in human HIF-1α to analyze patterns of hydroxylation of HIF-1α in cells. Our results reveal major differences in the regulation of HIF prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation by hypoxia and different classes of chemical inhibitors of these hydroxylases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Experimental Conditions Cells were cultured in DMEM (MCF7, HeLa, HT1080, and human skin fibroblasts) or RPMI 1640 (PC3, OVCAR-3, HepG2, and K562), each supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin. Stable RCC4 transfectants expressing vector alone (RCC4/VA, referred to here as RCC4) or functional VHL (RCC4/VHL) have been described (26). U2OS cells expressing doxycyline-inducible HIF-1α genes were derived from U2OS cells bearing the reverse tetracycline responsive transactivator and tetKRAB silencer transgenes (27), by transfection with pUHD10–3MCS expressing full-length C-terminal PK-tagged HIF-1α sequences (HIF-1α/pUHD) or a M561A + M568A mutant produced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) and pSV2-hph, containing the hygromycin resistance gene (ATCC). After selection of transfectants in hygromycin (200 μg/ml) (Roche Applied Science), cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with a 10% Tet system-approved FBS (Clontech), 5 μg/ml of blasticidin S (Invitrogen), and 200 μg/ml of hygromycin, in addition to the supplements detailed above. Hypoxic incubations were performed in In vivo2 400 hypoxic workstations (Ruskin Technologies). Where specified, Lumox dishes (Greiner Bio-one) were used to achieve rapid gas equilibration between the atmosphere and the culture medium. Desferrioxamine (DFO), 2,2′-dipyridyl, and ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (EDHB) were from Sigma. The following compounds were synthesized as reported: 4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,10-phenanthroline-3-carboxylic acid (28), bicyclic isoquinolinyl compounds A and B (29), and N-oxalyl phenylalanine derivatives C-F (30). Chemicals were dissolved in DMSO and added directly to culture medium at final DMSO concentrations of ≤2%. Dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) was from Frontier Scientific and dissolved in PBS. MG132 was from Enzo Life Sciences. Exposure time was 4–5 h.In Vitro Transcription/Translation (IVTT) HIF-α proteins were expressed as GAL4 (residues 1–147) fusions using the IVTT kit (Promega). Plasmids expressing GAL4/HIF-1α residues 28–826 (wild-type or Pro402, Pro564, and Asn803 mutants), or GAL4/HIF-2α residues 19–870 were constructed from pcDNA3 using standard recombinant methods.Suppression of Gene Expression by siRNA Cells were seeded at 40% confluence in antibiotic-free medium for 16 h prior to transfection with siRNAs directed against Drosophila SIMA (dHIF) (31), or human HIF-1α or HIF-2α (32). Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was used for transfection of 20 nm siRNA duplex twice at 24-h intervals. Cells were harvested 24 h after the second transfection.Antibodies Rabbit anti-HIF-1α Hyp402 was developed in collaboration with Millipore Biosciences (catalog number 07-1585). Mouse mAb against HIF-1α hydroxy-Asn803 was as described (33). Other antibodies were as follows: anti-HIF-1α Hyp564 (clone-D43B5, New England Biolabs); anti-GAL4 (clone-RK5C1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pan-anti-HIF-1α (clone-54, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-HIF-2α (clone-190b; Wiesener et al. 51), and HRP-conjugated anti-β-actin (clone AC15, Abcam).Immunoblotting and Densitometric Analyses Cells were lysed in urea/SDS buffer (6.7 m urea, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, and 1% SDS) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). Extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore), and probed with primary antibodies followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrates (Pierce) were used to visualize immunoreactive species. Signal intensities were measured by densitometry using the AutoChemi System with Labworks 4.6 Image Acquisition and Analysis Software (UVP Inc. USA). Statistical significance was determined using a one-way analysis of variance Dunnett's post hoc test using SPSS statistics 17.0; differences were considered significant if p values were <0.05.Mass Spectrometry Doxycycline-inducible PK-tagged wild-type or mutant HIF-1α transfectants were incubated with 1 μg/ml of doxycycline for 24 h, either in the presence of the 2-OG oxygenase inhibitor DMOG (1 mm) for the same duration, or with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (25 μm) for the last 4 h. Following anti-PK immunoprecipitation, separation by SDS-PAGE and in-gel digestion of the isolated bands with trypsin and Glu-C, samples were analyzed on a C18 nano-AcquityTM UPLCTM column coupled to a Waters Q-TOF Tandem mass spectrometer (Milford, MA) in positive ESI mode as described previously (34). Data acquisition was performed in high-low collision energy switching mode (MSE). MS/MS data base searches were carried out using ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS version 2.2.5) and MASCOT (version 2.2) on an in-house server (CBRG, University of Oxford).Protein Extracts from Rat and Human Tissues Studies of animal and human tissues were approved by the Universität Erlangen institutional review board for the care of animal subjects and the United Kingdom Ethical Committee (number C02.216), respectively. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River; 200–300 g) were treated with carbon monoxide (CO, 0.1%) for 6 h to achieve a functional anemia. Animals were sacrificed and kidneys were harvested immediately and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Human tissues were obtained from renal and breast cancer patients at operation and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were mashed into a paste in a dry ice-chilled metal chamber and immediately homogenized in urea/SDS buffer. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min the supernatants were heat-denatured in sample buffer and used in immunoblotting. Protein contents were measured using the Detergent Compatible Assay kit (Bio-Rad).RESULTSValidation of Hydroxy Residue-specific Antibodies Initially we carried out a series of experiments to determine the specificity of antibodies for the detection of different hydroxylated HIF-α species. We first prepared HIF-α polypeptides that were wild-type, or contained mutations at each of the prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation sites, as GAL4-HIF-α fusion proteins using an IVTT system. Reactions were performed in the presence of iron chelator DFO or iron supplement (FeCl2) to inhibit or promote hydroxylation, respectively. Results are shown in Fig. 1. Antibodies directed against epitopes that encompass each of the hydroxyproline residues in HIF-1α (Hyp402 and Hyp564) or the hydroxyasparaginyl residue (HyAsn803) showed strong reactivity to HIF-1α that was produced in the presence of FeCl2, but little or no reactivity to that produced in the presence of DFO, suggesting that each of these antibodies is highly specific for the hydroxylated form (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2). The antibodies were also highly specific for HIF-1α versus HIF-2α (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2 and 3, and supplemental Fig. S1). Substitution at each site of hydroxylation in HIF-1α ablated reactivity of the relevant antibody, indicating that the antibodies were highly specific to each site; anti-Hyp402 did not react against Hyp564 and vice versa.FIGURE 1. Reactivity of hydroxy residue-specific anti-HIF1α antibodies. Immunoblots demonstrating the specificity of anti-hydroxy Pro402 (Hyp402), anti-hydroxy Pro564 (Hyp564), and anti-hydroxy Asn803 (HyAsn803) antibodies for these hydroxylated residues in human HIF-1α. HIF-1α (wild-type and mutants P402A, P564G, or N803A) and HIF-2α polypeptides were produced as GAL4 fusions in IVTT reactions in the presence of DFO (Df) or ferrous chloride (Fe). Anti-GAL4 signals provide an internal control for normalization. Note a low level of cross-activity with HIF-2α observed for anti-hydroxy Pro564 and anti-hydroxy Asn803 in this immunoblot in lane 3. To further verify the specificity for hydroxylated forms of HIF-1α in cells, we expressed HIF-1α polypeptides in cells at levels that enabled direct analysis of hydroxylation by mass spectrometry (MS) and analyzed aliquots of cell extract in parallel by hydroxy residue-specific immunoblotting and MS. Under normoxic conditions, cells were exposed to DMOG to inhibit hydroxylation, or MG132 to inhibit the proteasome and cause accumulation of hydroxylated HIF-1α. To simplify the semi-quantitative analysis of Hyp564 by MS, neighboring methionine residues (Met561 and Met568) were mutated to alanines. The results of a typical set of experiments are shown in Fig. 2. Comparison with MS analysis confirmed that each antibody manifested a high degree of hydroxy residue specificity, demonstrating the complete absence of activity against the unhydroxylated epitope and enabling an estimate of the efficiency of detection of the hydroxylated form.FIGURE 2. Validation of hydroxy residue-specific antibody performance by MS. A–C show data for sites in HIF-1α NODD, CODD, and C-terminal activation domain (CAD) sequences, respectively. Cells expressing doxycycline-inducible PK-tagged wild-type or mutant (M561A + M568A) HIF-1α were induced with doxycycline (1 μg/ml) in the presence of 1 mm DMOG for 24 h, or 25 μm MG132 for the last 4 h. For MS, PK immunoprecipitation was followed by in-gel digestion. The resulting peptides were analyzed by MS. The [M+2H]2+ precursor ions corresponding to the unhydroxylated and hydroxylated peptides are given together with chromatographic output (extracted ion counts) at these masses. Percentage hydroxylation was calculated from peak areas. * indicates confounding ions with a similar mass to the hydroxylated CODD peptide. Aliquots of the immunoprecipitation samples were immunoblotted with the hydroxy residue-specific or pan-HIF-1α antibodies as indicated. Note these hydroxyl residue-specific immunoblots were differentially exposed to allow secure ascertainment of the absence of signal in samples in which hydroxylation was demonstrated by MS to be suppressed.Status of Asparginyl Hydroxylation of HIF-1α in Hypoxic Cells Because asparaginyl hydroxylation regulates the activity of HIF transcription, it is important to understand whether and to what extent HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation persists under conditions that induce HIF-1α protein levels. We therefore examined a series of different cell types exposed to different levels of hypoxia or DMOG; in the first instance cultures were exposed in parallel to 1% oxygen, or DMOG, or maintained under normoxic conditions. As expected, strong up-regulation of the HIF-1α protein levels was observed, reflecting inhibition of the HIF prolyl hydroxylation/degradation pathway. However, in 1% oxygen HIF-1α asparaginyl hydroxylation persisted in all these cell types, although to a variable extent (Fig. 3A). Results obtained following exposure to DMOG were markedly different (Fig. 3B); despite similar levels of up-regulated HIF-1α, exposure of cells to DMOG almost totally suppressed asparaginyl hydroxylation. To provide more quantitative data on the effect of 1% oxygen, different quantities of cell extracts from two cell types showing different responses (PC3 cells and HSF cells) were blotted for total and asparaginyl hydroxylated HIF-1α and signals were compared with a calibration standard provided by extracts from the cells treated with proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and analyzed by MS (Fig. 3C). These experiments revealed that HIF-1α induced by 1% oxygen in HSF cells was >90% hydroxylated, whereas in PC3 cells the region was 50% hydroxylated. To further investigate the regulation of asparaginyl hydroxylation by hypoxia, cultures of cells were exposed either to 1 or 0.2% oxygen (Fig. 3D). These experiments demonstrated that the asparaginyl hydroxylation that persisted at 1% oxygen was strongly suppressed at 0.2% oxygen.FIGURE 3. Levels of HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation in hypoxic cells and in rat and human tissues. A and B illustrate HIF-1α protein levels and Asn803 hydroxylation status in different cell lines under nomoxia (Nx), hypoxia (Hx, 1% oxygen), or exposed to 1 mm DMOG (Dm) for 5 h. HSF, primary human skin fibroblasts. C illustrates densitometric analyses of asparaginyl hydroxylation in two hypoxic cell extracts from A, with calibration against a standard assayed by MS. D illustrates the effect of more severe hypoxia (5 h) on HIF-1α asparaginyl hydroxylation in HT1080 and MCF7 cells. E, immunoblots of rat kidney and human cancer tissues. Lanes 1 and 2, MS standard as in C loaded at different volumes (v). Lanes 3 and 4, kidney extracts of rats breathing air (Nx) or treated with carbon monoxide (CO, 0.1%) for 6 h. Lanes 5 and 6, extracts from normal kidney and papillary kidney tumor from the same patient. Lanes 7–9, tumor extracts from different patients. Finally to determine whether asparaginyl hydroxylation might persist under conditions that induce HIF proteins in intact tissues, we studied HIF-1α from kidneys of rats that had been exposed to 0.1% carbon monoxide to create functional anemia and from a range of human tumor samples (Fig. 3E). These studies demonstrate the existence of substantial levels of HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation under these pathophysiological conditions.Differential Sensitivity of HIF-1α Prolyl and Asparaginyl Hydroxylation to Hypoxia The above experiments indicated that despite strong accumulation of HIF-1α in cells cultured in 1% oxygen, high levels of asparaginyl hydroxylation persisted. Because accumulation of HIF-1α in hypoxia is mediated by suppression of prolyl hydroxylation, these results suggest the existence of differential sensitivity of prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation to hypoxia in vivo. We therefore sought to compare the sensitivity of different prolyl and asparaginyl sites to graded hypoxia directly in their endogenous context. Prolyl-hydroxylated HIF is degraded by the VHL E3 ligase pathway, confounding comparison of prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation in VHL competent cells. We therefore conducted experiments in VHL-deficient RCC4 cells, in which this pathway is inactive. Immunoblotting of RCC4 extracts revealed strong signals with each of the hydroxy residue-specific HIF-1α antibodies, indicating that both HIF prolyl and HIF asparaginyl hydroxylations proceed efficiently in the absence of VHL. To confirm this, we compared hydroxy residue-specific and total HIF-1α signals in these cells with those obtained from MS-quantified samples. Although the accuracy of this comparison was limited by the need to introduce substitutions in the region of Pro564 to simplify MS analysis, which slightly impaired epitope recognition at that site (data not shown), HIF-1α hydroxylation was estimated to be complete or close to complete at each of the three sites in normoxic RCC4 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Preliminary experiments established that the half-life of HIF-1α in RCC4 cells was in the region of 60 min (supplemental Fig. S3); hence exposure to graded hypoxia for 4 h should be sufficient to allow HIF hydroxylation to achieve a new steady-state. In further pilot experiments we observed that suppression of hydroxylation occurred more rapidly in cells cultured in Lumox culture dishes (35) in which the cell monolayer is grown on a gas-permeable base, thereby minimizing gradients between the atmosphere and the monolayer and inaccuracies arising from release of oxygen dissolved in plasticware (supplemental Fig. S4). Thus, Lumox dishes were used for these and all other experiments involving short-term severe hypoxia (≤0.1% oxygen for ≤4 h). Exposure of RCC4 cells to different levels of hypoxia had markedly different effects on each site of hydroxylation (Fig. 4, panels A and B). These experiments revealed that prolyl hydroxylation was more sensitive than asparaginyl hydroxylation to hypoxia and that Hyp402 was more sensitive than Hyp564. Whereas 0.1% oxygen almost completely suppressed prolyl hydroxylation at both sites, asparaginyl hydroxylation remained in the region of 40%; at 0.5% oxygen, levels of hydroxylation were ∼50, 75, and 100% at Pro402, Pro564, and Asn803, respectively.FIGURE 4. Effect of graded hypoxia and chronic hypoxia on HIF-1α hydroxylation. A and B, graded hypoxia. RCC4 cells grown on Lumox dishes were incubated at the indicated oxygen concentrations for 4 h. The experiment was performed in triplicate. A, representative immunoblots; B, semi-quantitative analysis of relative band intensities (mean ± S.E., n = 3). *, significantly different from normoxia (21%), p < 0.05. C and D, chronic hypoxia. RCC4 cells, seeded to achieve similar density at time of analysis, were incubated in normoxia (Nx) or hypoxia (Hx, 1% oxygen) for 8 h to 7 days. Two independent experiments were performed, each in duplicate. C, representative immunoblots. D, semi-quantitative analysis of relative band intensities (mean ± S.E., n = 4). In panels B and D, the relative intensity is the ratio of the hydroxy residue-specific signal to total anti-HIF-1α in that sample. Based on preliminary data indicating that hydroxylation at all sites were essentially 100% in normoxic RCC4 cells, these values were plotted with the ratio in normoxic cells set to one (equivalent to 100% hydroxylation). In B, normoxic S.E. values have been omitted for clarity. In understanding the physiological signaling of hypoxia, an important question is whether the specific activities of HIF hydroxylases alter in adaptation to chronic hypoxia. One possibility that has been considered is that increased specific activity in hypoxia might provide an adaptive response that would reset oxygen sensitivity in long-term hypoxia. Because two of the HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, PHD2 and PHD3, are themselves transcriptional targets of HIF that are strikingly up-regulated in hypoxia (12, 36), assays of the effects of long-term hypoxia on the specific activity of the hydroxylases are complicated by large changes in enzyme abundance. However, in VHL-defective RCC4 cells HIF is constitutively activated, thus limiting changes in PHD abundance, and simplifying the interpretation of changes in HIF hydroxylation. We therefore exposed RCC4 cells for periods of hypoxia up to 7 days and monitored changes in hydroxylation at all three sites. Cells were plated so that levels of confluence were similar at the time of harvest. Results are shown in Fig. 4, C and D. Under these conditions, total HIF-1α levels declined slightly in relationship to the β-actin normalization control during the course of the experiment. As predicted in VHL-deficient RCC4 cells, we did not observe induction of PHD protein levels that occurs normally as a consequence of HIF activation; over the 7-day period, levels of immunoreactive PHD and FIH enzymes were either unchanged or modestly reduced. After 8 h hypoxia (1% oxygen), there were clear reductions in the extent of prolyl hydroxylation but not asparaginyl hydroxylation. After continued exposure to hypoxia over 7 days, there was no evidence that suppression of prolyl hydroxylation was less, as might be expected with increased PHD activation; rather the extent of HIF hydroxylation was either unchanged or modestly reduced at all sites. These experiments therefore do not support the existence of major HIF-independent increases in the specific activity of the hydroxylases in response to chronic hypoxia over this period of time. We next measured the effects of reoxygenation on each hydroxylation site. RCC4 cells were exposed to severe hypoxia (0.1% oxygen for 4 h) and then re-exposed to ambient (21%) oxygen. The results (Fig. 5A) reveal that although hydroxylation at Asn803 and Pro564 was essentially complete within 1 min but this was not the case for Pro402 where a significant delay in hydroxylation was observed. To further analyze these differences, we returned to study the induction of HIF-1α by hypoxia in VHL-competent cells in more detail. In preliminary experiments we observed differences between cell types in the behavior of Pro402 and Pro564 during induction of HIF-1α by hypoxia. In some cell types, but not others, during short periods of hypoxic exposure, substantial hydroxylation at Pro564 was observed in accumulating HIF-1α protein; in contrast hydroxylation of Pro402 remained low in all cell types studied. We therefore performed further experiments at different durations and severities of hypoxic exposure on two cell types (HT1080 and HeLa cells) that manifest contrasting behavior for hydroxylation at Pro564. Consistent and striking differences were observed. Accumulation of HIF-1α that was hydroxylated at Hyp564 was seen in HeLa cells at both 3 and 1% oxygen, whereas in HT1080 cells only minimal increases in hydroxylated Hyp564 were observed at 3% oxygen and none at 1% oxygen. In contrast, increases in hydroxylated Hyp402 were never observed during the accumulation of HIF-1α in hypoxic cells of either type (Fig. 5, B and C). Immunoblotting for HIF prolyl hydroxylases PHD2 and PHD3 revealed that, as expected, both enzymes were strongly induced by hypoxia. Interestingly, however, induction of PHD3 was much more marked in HeLa than HT1080 cells, perhaps contributing to the differences in regulation of hydroxylation at Pro564. Taken together these results confirm that HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylations at residues 402 and 564 are differentially regulated as a function of oxygen availability. Taken together with the other data, they are compatible with a model in which hydroxylation at Pro402 is more readily suppressed in hypoxia than hydroxylation at Pro564 and in which hydroxylation at both sites is necessary for high rates of VHL-mediated degradation (25).FIGURE 5. Differential regulation of HIF-1α hydroxylation sites during hypoxic induction and during re-oxygenation. A, reoxygenation. RCC4 cells, incubated in Lumox dishes in normoxia (Nx) or hypoxia (Hx; 0.1% oxygen) for 4 h, were then exposed to normoxia for the indicated times. Hydroxylation at Hyp564 and HyAsn803 is complete within 1 min, but delayed at Hyp402. B and C, induction of HIF-1α by hypoxia. HeLa or HT1080 cells were incubated in normoxia or hypoxia (1 or 3% oxygen) for the indicated times (h). Immunoblots were probed with the indicated antibodies. During the accumulation of HIF-1α in hypoxic cells, substantial hydroxylation at Hyp564 but not Hyp402 is observed, particularly in HeLa cells.Differential Sensitivity of Prolyl and Asparaginyl Hydroxylation to Chemical Inhibition We next sought to determine the specificity or otherwise of HIF hydroxylase inhibitors for the different sites of hydroxylation in HIF-1α. Several supposedly nonspecific inhibitors of the HIF hydroxylases, including iron chelating agents, cobaltous ions, and the 2-oxogluarate analogue DMOG have been commonly employed as “hypoxia mimetics” in studies of the HIF system. First we tested the effects of these agents on HIF-1α hydroxylations in RCC4 cells. Unexpectedly, these studies revealed considerable specificity in the response. Whereas asparaginyl hydroxylation was substantially more sensitive to DMOG than prolyl hydroxylation, the reverse was true for cobaltous ions, which inhibited prolyl but not asparaginyl hydroxylation. Both hydroxylations were sensitive to the iron chelators, DFO and 2,2′-dipyridyl, although prolyl hydroxylation was more sensitive than asparaginyl hydroxylation (Fig. 6, A and B). For comparison we also tested two bicyclic isoquinolinyl compounds (A and B) developed as HIF hydroxylase inhibitors in similar assays (Fig. 6C); these inhibitors were highly specific for prolyl over asparaginyl hydroxylation. These studies indicate that exposure of cells to these agents is not equivalent and that different agents might be predicted to have strikingly different effects on the asparaginyl hydroxylation status of HIF-1α protein that is induced in VHL-competent cells.FIGURE 6. Differential inhibition of HIF prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation by HIF hydroxylase inhibitors. A–C, VHL-defective (RCC4) cells. D–F, VHL-competent (RCC4/VHL) cells. Cells were treated with inhibitors as indicated (see supplemental Fig. S5 for structures). Immunoblots were probed with the indicated antibodies. Controls were exposed to 0–2% DMSO in accordance with the diluent used for the test substance. To pursue this, we exposed RCC4/VHL (VHL-competent) cells to different types of HIF hydroxylase inhibitor, and compared levels of total and asparaginyl-hydroxylated HIF. Results are shown in Fig. 6, D–F. Cobaltous, nickel, manganous, and zinc ions all induced HIF-1α protein that remained strongly hydroxylated on Asn803 in the 70–100% region (Fig. 6D and data not shown). Interestingly, the iron chelators, DFO and 2,2′-dipyridyl, manifest different dose-dependent effects, with 2,2′-dipyridyl but not DFO restricting asparaginyl hydroxylation at high doses (Fig. 6E). Different small molecule inhibitors (see supplemental Fig. S5 for structures) had strikingly different effects; some inhibited asparaginyl hydroxylation strongly, whereas others had no apparent effect on asparaginyl hydroxylation even at high dosage (Fig. 6, E and F). Thus whereas all these substances induced HIF by inhibition of prolyl hydroxylation, they have highly variable effects on asparaginyl hydroxylation. Finally, we sought to develop and test cell-permeable molecules that might inhibit HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation and not HIF prolyl hydroxylation. Based on the results of in vitro assays, which demonstrated that the N-oxalyl amino acid (R)-2-(carboxyformamido)-3-phenylpropanoic acid (compound F), but not the (S)-enantiomer (compound D) was a powerful inhibitor of FIH, we produced cell-penetrating esterified derivatives of these compounds (E and C, for structures, see supplemental Fig. S5). RCC4 cells were exposed to both the esterified derivatives and the free acids. Results are shown in Fig. 7A. (R)-Methyl-2-(2-methoxy-2-oxoacetamido)-3-phenylpropanoate (compound E) but not (S)-enantiomers (compounds C and D) specifically inhibited HIF asparaginyl but not prolyl hydroxylation. The free acid form of compound E (compound F) also showed the same effect but to a lesser extent.FIGURE 7. Selective chemical inhibition of HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation. A, VHL-defective (RCC4) cells were treated with inhibitors as indicated for 5 h. Immunoblots show inhibition of Asn803 hydroxylation by compounds E and F. B, compound E (5 h) did not up-regulate HIF-1α in RCC4/VHL cells. C, RCC4/VHL cells were exposed to compound E (5 h) in the presence or absence of hypoxia (1% oxygen) for the last 2 h. Compound E inhibited Asn803 hydroxylation in the HIF-1α induced by hypoxia. When RCC4/VHL cells were exposed to compound E, no induction of HIF-1α was observed consistent with the absence of action on HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylation (Fig. 7B). However, when compound E was combined with hypoxia, inhibition of asparaginyl hydroxylation on induced HIF-1α was observed, demonstrating effective and specific inhibition of HIF-1α asparaginyl hydroxylation (Fig. 7C).DISCUSSION This work comprises the first direct analysis of the differential regulation of sites of HIF prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation in cells. Hydroxy residue-specific antibodies, whose performance was validated by MS, were used to analyze hydroxylation levels at each of the three known sites of hydroxylation in human HIF-1α (Pro402, Pro564, and Asn803). The findings reveal major differences in the regulation of these hydroxylations by hypoxia and in their sensitivity to supposedly nonspecific hydroxylase inhibitors. Using VHL-defective RCC4 cells to avoid confounding bias from selective degradation of prolyl-hydroxylated HIF-α polypeptides, we were able to directly compare changes in prolyl versus asparaginyl hydroxylation. These experiments demonstrated that in normoxic RCC4 cells HIF-1α is heavily or even completely hydroxylated at all three sites. They reveal that HIF-1α asparaginyl hydroxylation is substantially more resistant to hypoxia than either site of prolyl hydroxylation. Similar differential sensitivity of prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation was observed over a range of short hypoxic exposures and maintained during chronic hypoxia. Reported apparent Km measurements for oxygen for the HIF hydroxylases (21, 22, 24) are all very much higher than the oxygen concentrations used in the graded hypoxia experiment in the current work and those previously measured in studies of human tissues (37, 38). Therefore, whereas differences in Km values for oxygen have been reported for the PHDs versus FIH (21, 22), they cannot account for our in vivo findings, and the precise kinetic parameters underlying the differential sensitivity to hypoxia that we have observed in vivo are not yet clear. Such analyses are also likely to be complicated by the existence of alternative non-HIF substrates, particularly for FIH. In addition to HIF, FIH catalyzes hydroxylation of specific asparaginyl residues in a wide range of ankyrin repeat domain proteins (34, 39). Some of these, such as the Notch-1 receptor are very effective competitors of HIF hydroxylation in vitro (40–42). Given that many ankyrin repeat domain proteins that are subject to FIH-catalyzed hydroxylation such as cytoskeletal ankyrins (43) are also expressed at relatively high abundance across a wide range of cells, our finding of high levels of hydroxylation of HIF-1α Asn803 except in cells exposed to severe hypoxia or chemical inhibitors was somewhat surprising and suggests that additional factors operate in vivo to direct FIH-mediated catalysis to particular molecular targets. Our studies did not reveal any evidence for a compensatory increase in the specific activity of the HIF hydroxylases in chronic hypoxia. Although an increased specific activity of the PHDs during chronic hypoxia has been reported in VHL-competent cells that manifest intact HIF transcriptional responses, this was potentially attributed to HIF-dependent reductions in mitochrondrial oxygen consumption that could reduce the severity of cellular hypoxia (44). In our studies of chronic hypoxia in VHL-defective cells, such HIF-dependent effects would not be anticipated and our finding of no increase in specific activity of the HIF hydroxylases in this setting is therefore consistent with the authors' interpretation of the previous work. Although the use of VHL-defective cells was necessary to enable direct comparison of interventions on prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation, up-regulation of HIF pathways in these cells leads to constitutive up-regulation of HIF prolyl hydroxylases, PHD2 and PHD3 (12, 36). In contrast, expression of FIH is unaffected by the VHL status. Thus it is likely that VHL-competent cells, which therefore express lower levels of PHD2 and PHD3 relative to FIH, effectively manifest even greater differential sensitivity of prolyl to asparaginyl hydroxylation at least during the acute phase of hypoxic exposure. Operationally, however, the key consideration in defining the response to hypoxia in VHL-competent cells is the extent to which HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation persists on HIF-1α molecules that escape the prolyl hydroxylation/VHL degradation pathway. Our findings reveal that in moderately hypoxic cells, tissues from hypoxic animals, and human tumors, HIF-1α remains substantially strongly hydroxylated on asparagine. The levels of persistent asparaginyl hydroxylation were cell type-specific and strongly dependent on the severity of hypoxic exposure. These findings are consistent with reports that suppression of FIH can increase HIF target gene expression in moderately hypoxic cells (27, 45) and they indicate that monitoring of HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation is likely to be important in future physiological analyses of the HIF transcriptional pathway (46). Analysis of all three sites of HIF hydroxylation also permitted comparison of the two sites of prolyl hydroxylation. Consistent with previous work we observed that hydroxylation at Pro402 apparently occurred after that at Pro564 and was more sensitivity to hypoxia. Whether this is due to intrinsic differences in the sensitivity of each site to hypoxia or competition between the two sites as has been demonstrated in vitro (47) is unclear. However, differences in the behavior of the two sites in vivo were marked. For instance, upon exposure to moderate hypoxia, striking accumulation of HIF-1α that was hydroxylated at Pro564 but not Pro402 was observed, which was again cell type-specific. Interestingly, accumulation of HIF-1α that was hydroxylated on Pro564 correlated with increased expression of PHD3, the enzyme that preferentially hydroxylates this site (12, 25), suggesting that cell-type differences in expression of PHD3 may contribute to these differences. Mutational studies of HIF-1α have indicated that each site of prolyl hydroxylation in HIF-1α can independently mediate VHL-dependent degradation of HIF-α (7). Nevertheless, the current findings would suggest that the preferential hydroxylation of Pro564 that is observed in moderately hypoxic cells might not on its own be sufficient to cause VHL-mediated degradation of HIF-1α at a rate that is adequate to overcome synthesis. It is consistent with the proposal that efficient operation of the prolyl hydroxylation-VHL degradation pathway is dependent on some form of cooperative interaction between the 2 sites of prolyl hydroxylation that promotes more rapid, or more complete VHL-dependent degradation (25). Dependence of rapid HIF-1α degradation on hydroxylation at both sites would be predicted to further enhance the sensitivity of the prolyl hydroxylation-VHL degradation pathway to hypoxia relative to that of asparaginyl hydroxylation. Furthermore, because Pro564, like Asn803 is sited within a HIF-α transactivation domain, the hydroxylation status at Pro564 may have additional regulatory effects on HIF activity (48). The use of hydroxy residue-specific antibodies also permitted comparative analysis of different modes of HIF hydroxylase inhibition on different sites of HIF hydroxylation. Striking differences were observed among agents that are often regarded as being nonspecific hydroxylase inhibitors and which are commonly applied to cells as hypoxia mimetics. In particular, at concentrations that had marked effects on HIF prolyl hydroxylation, iron chelators were much less effective, and transition metals ions such as Co(II) were almost completely ineffective in inhibiting asparaginyl hydroxylation of HIF-1α. In contrast, the generic 2-OG analogue DMOG was found to be even more effective at suppressing HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation than HIF prolyl hydroxylation. Interestingly, findings on the differential sensitivity of prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation to transition metals ions and iron chelators in cells are very different from effects of these inhibitors on purified or partially purified preparations of these enzymes in vitro (49). FIH has been reported to be much more sensitive than PHDs to inhibition by metal ions in vitro (49), whereas we observed the opposite in vivo. Similarly PHDs (particularly PHD2) bind Fe(II) tightly in vitro and are much less sensitive to inhibition by DFO than FIH (49, 50). However, in vivo we observed the opposite; greater sensitivity of prolyl versus asparaginyl hydroxylation to inhibition by iron chelators. The reasons for these differences are not clear and strongly suggest that the mechanism(s) of inhibition are more complex than facile exchange of iron at the catalytic center of the HIF hydroxylases with a chelatable iron pool. Exposure of cells to several different small molecule HIF hydroxylase inhibitors revealed greatly differing levels of specificity for the two types of HIF hydroxylation. Some inhibitors, such as ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate and 4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,10-phenanthroline-3-carboxylic acid, inhibited both types of hydroxylation, in keeping with in vitro data on these compounds (21, 22, 28). In contrast, the bicyclic isoquinolinyl compounds A and B (29) revealed almost complete selectivity for inhibition of prolyl versus asparaginyl hydroxylation, whereas the N-oxalyl phenylalanine derivative, compound E (30), was strongly selective for HIF asparaginyl over HIF prolyl hydroxylation, clearly demonstrating the feasibility of specifically inhibiting each pathway in cells. The HIF pathway plays a central role in directing cellular responses to hypoxia and is currently the focus of attempts at therapeutic manipulation in a range of disease settings that are associated with tissue hypoxia (18–20). Major differences in the regulation of HIF prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation described above are therefore important in understanding biological responses to hypoxia. These insights, together with the existence of validated reagents for further study, should assist in guiding attempts at pharmacological modulation of hypoxia pathways.

Muscle histology examinations revealed that some families suffer from a polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM). It is assumed that a gene expression signature related to PSSM should be observed at the transcriptional level because the glycogen storage disease could also be linked to other dysfunctions in gene regulation. Thus, the functional genomic approach could be conducted in order to provide new knowledge about the metabolic disorders related to PSSM. We propose exploring the PSSM muscle fiber metabolic disorders by measuring gene expression in relationship with the histological phenotype. Genotypying analysis of GYS1 mutation revealed 2 homozygous (AA) and 5 heterozygous (GA) PSSM horses. In the PSSM muscles, histological data revealed PAS positive amylase resistant abnormal polysaccharides, inflammation, necrosis, and lipomatosis and active regeneration of fibers. Ultrastructural evaluation revealed a decrease of mitochondrial number and structural disorders. Extensive accumulation of an abnormal polysaccharide displaced and partially replaced mitochondria and myofibrils. The severity of the disease was higher in the two homozygous PSSM horses. Gene expression analysis revealed 129 genes significantly modulated (p < 0.05). The following genes were up-regulated over 2 fold: IL18, CTSS, LUM, CD44, FN1, GST01. The most down-regulated genes were the following: mitochondrial tRNA, SLC2A2, PRKCα, VEGFα. Data mining analysis showed that protein synthesis, apoptosis, cellular movement, growth and proliferation were the main cellular functions significantly associated with the modulated genes (p < 0.05). Several up-regulated genes, especially IL18, revealed a severe muscular inflammation in PSSM muscles. The up-regulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3β) under its active form could be responsible for glycogen synthase (GYS1) inhibition and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1α) destabilization. The main disorders observed in PSSM muscles could be related to mitochondrial dysfunctions, glycogenesis inhibition and the chronic hypoxia of the PSSM muscles.

Background Several cases of metabolic myopathies have been observed in the Norman Cob horse breed used to pull carriages [1]. Muscle histology examinations revealed that one bloodline suffers from a glycogenosis described as polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM) in Quarter horses [2,3] and classified as non-exertional myopathies with rhadomyolysis in equine muscle disorders [4]. The disease has also been observed in Andalusian horses (Spanish purebred horses) [5], Belgian Draft Horses, Morgan, Arabian, Standardbred, ponies, Warm-blooded horses [6] and a mule [7]. The prevalence of PSSM among overtly healthy Quarter Horses in the United States is likely to be between 6% and 12% [8]. A PSSM phenotype has been characterized in a Norman Cob horse pedigree and in a population of stallions, by histological demonstration in striated muscular fibers of an accumulation of some periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive amylase-resistant polysaccharides appearing ultrastructurally as glycogen-like particles [1,9]. Using this criteria, the affection prevalence was 33% among a sample of French stallions. The prevalence of PSSM in Norman Cob stallions was closer to the 36% PSSM affected horses diagnosed in Belgian Draft Horses [10] than the 8% observed in draft horses in the United Kingdom [11]. The common clinical signs of PSSM in various breeds are abnormal hind limb gait, poor muscling, generalized muscle atrophy, poor performance, back soreness, exercise intolerance, spontaneous decumbency with inability to rise, episodic "colic" and rhabdomyolysis [12]. In Humans, 11 types of glycogenosis (or glycogen storage diseases) have been described, each containing several sub-types [13]. The genes responsible for glycogen storage diseases in humans [13] or involved in the glycogen pathway were identified in the PubMed data basis and could be considered as candidates for equine PSSM: G6PC, SLC37A4, NPT4, GAA, AGL, GBE1, GBE2, PYGM, PYGL, PFKM, PHKA2, PHKB, PHKG2, PHKA1, PHKG1, GYS1, GYS2. However, in equine PSSM, the aetiology and physiopathology are not known. The excessive glycogen storage and formation of abnormal polysaccharide in PSSM horses therefore appears to reflect an increase in glycogen synthesis rather than a decrease in its utilisation [3]. Glucose tolerance tests showed that PSSM horses have enhanced cellular uptake of glucose and an increased sensitivity to insulin [14]. Neither glycogenolytic or glycolytic enzyme deficiencies, nor abnormality in the phosphofructokinase (PFKM) regulation, have been identified in affected horses [2,15]. The enhanced insulin sensitivity in PSSM horses is not due to an increase of the glucose transporter GLUT4 content or insulin receptor quantity [16]. Attempts to measure branching enzyme activities with methods developed for human muscle were unsuccessful [2]. Linkage studies did not demonstrate the relationships between PSSM and the candidate genes AMPK [17,18] or AGL [19]. A specific form of fatal glycogen storage disease was observed in a Quarter horse foal where a nonsense mutation in codon 34 of the glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) was identified [20]. This metabolic myopathy can be compared to human glycogenosis type IV where several mutations and deletions explain the total or partial deficiency of the GBE1 gene. In adult horses, a new G-to-A mutation within the gene encoding glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) has recently been observed in Quarter horses and some warm-blooded horses [21]. It is assumed that the metabolic disorders of PSSM muscles could be observed in detail at the transcription level because the gene(s) responsible for glycogen storage disease would also be linked to other dysfunctions and to some failure in gene regulatory networks. Thus, the functional genomics approach could be conducted in order to provide new knowledge about the metabolic disorders related to PSSM. For a better understanding of the PSSM physiopathology in Norman Cob horses, we propose exploring the PSSM muscle fiber metabolic disorders by measuring gene expression in relationship with the histological phenotype.MethodsHorses, genotyping and muscle biopsies All the horses were genotyped for the GYS1 c.926G>A mutation [21] (wild type GG, heterozygous GA or homozygous AA). A biopsy of the gluteus medius muscle was performed in 13 Norman adult horses: 4 females and 9 males, 4–17 years old. This muscle was chosen because of (i) its important propulsion function in horse locomotion, (ii) its early and major histological involvement in the course of the disease [1] and (iii) the good standardization of biopsy sampling [22]. The horses were sedated and received a local anaesthesia before making a small skin incision according to a standardized protocol used in routine for muscle disease diagnostic. The biopsy of the dorsal compartment of the gluteus medius was performed at the first third distance between the sacral and coxae tuber. A biopsy needle with automatic sampling was vertically inserted until its extremity just under the fascia corresponding to a 3.5 cm depth for the gluteus medius. Each muscle biopsy was divided in two parts, and the first part was frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen for histological analysis and the second part was collected for genomic analysis. The blood was removed by absorbing it with a compress and immediately frozen in the RNA later® at -80°C. Informed consent was obtained from the horse owner, the French National Studs (Les Haras Nationaux), and the study was approved by the animal care committee of the National Research Institute of Agriculture (INRA).Histological analysis Briefly, the muscle samples were serially sectioned (8 mm thick) and each section was stained with either hematoxylin-eosin-safranine (HES), or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) with or without incubation for 20 minutes at 37°C with α-amylase [1]. Intracytoplasmic presence of amylase-resistant material was used as diagnosis criteria for PSSM: seven were PSSM horses and six were control horses [2]. Morphometric analysis was performed additionally for histologic quantitative evaluation using a digital camera (Nikon DXM 1200, Badhoevedo, Netherlands) combined with image-analyzing software (Lucia imaging software, Laboratory Imaging Inc., Prague, Czech Republic). Percentages of aggregate-containing and vacuolated fibers were calculated as described previously [1] from each PAS-amylase-stained and HES-stained sections respectively. Additional biopsies from one PSSM horse (#49) was designated for routine electron microscopy and subsequently fixed in 2.5% buffered glutaraldehyde, postfixed in osmium tetroxide, embedded in epoxy resin, cut into 1-mm-thick sections, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined by transmission electron microscopy.Production of the equine long oligonucleotide microarray Gene expression analysis was performed using a homemade equine long oligonucleotide microarray which included 384 equine transcripts: 50 probes of the mitochondrial genome and 334 probes of the nuclear genome [see Additional file 1 and GEO Platform accession number GPL8349: ]. This equine oligonucleotide microarray was designed according to the derived method used for open access human and mouse long oligonucleotide microarrays [23]. Briefly, the list of human annotated genes (available in the NCBI public data base) involved in muscle structure, contraction, energetic metabolism and inflammation processes was used to identify the equine candidate genes that could be interesting to put on the microarray. Then, this list of candidates was crossed with the orthologous equine sequences available in 2006 on the NCBI data base using a blast method [24]. In addition, 50 other probes of the equine mitochondrial genome were designed to measure the expression of the 13 genes (2 different probes per protein gene) coding for the protein units of the respiratory chain as well as 22 tRNA and 2 rRNA. Finally, 384 probes of 50 nucleotides long were calculated and synthesized with a 5' terminal – NH2 modification in order to attach the probe on the slides. The microarrays were spotted at the microarray service (LEFG, CEA, Evry, France) by printing the equine probes, suspended in a spotting buffer composed of 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and TE on hydrogel slides (Schott Nexterion), with a Microgrid-II-robot. The equine microarray can be spotted alone on a slide or jointly with the 25 K mouse oligonucleotide microarray [23]. This equine microarray has been validated by a reproducibility test, competition test, biological test for equine transcript analysis extracted from different muscles of different equine breeds and health status [unpublished data]. Fourteen microarrays were used for analysis of each PSSM muscle sample against reference control muscles using two fluorochromes in a dye-swap design (duplicate measurements).RNA extraction Total RNA was extracted from tissues by a phenol-chloroform method (TRIZOL® reagent). The quality of total RNA was verified by micro channel electrophoresis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip®, Bioanalyzer®). The total RNA concentration and RNA purity were measured by optical density with a spectrophotometer at 260 nm and the ratio 260/280 (Nanodrop®). RNA was considered as pure when the 260 nm out of 280 nm absorbance ratio was close to 2. The RNA were stored at -80°C.RNA in vitro transcription The synthesis of RNA with a polyA tail was performed using in vitro transcription with aminoallyl UTP. A total RNA (1 μg) was used to start the synthesis using the in vitro transcription kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Aminoallyl MessageAmp® II aRNA). This method equally increased the number of mRNA copies of each transcript without changing the proportion of the initial population of transcripts. The integrity and concentration of aminoallyl RNA (aaRNA) were checked again by micro channel electrophoresis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip®, Bioanalyzer®) and a spectrophotometer (Nonodrop®). The aaRNA were stored at -80°C.Microrray hybridization and signal quantification All the samples of PSSM muscles were hybridized against the reference control muscles. This reference was made by pooling together all the mRNA extracted after in vitro transcription from the 6 control muscles of the sound horses. Briefly, the hybridization protocol [24] included the following steps. After purification of the amino-modified RNA, monofunctional forms of the Cyanine 3 (Cy3) or Cyanine 5 (Cy5) fluorochrome were coupled to 5 μg of the studied sample and control sample by an indirect method: the ester groups linked to the fluorochromes were bound on the amino-allyl groups incorporated on the RNA during the in vitro transcription. The marked targets were then mixed and hybridized on the same chip for immediate comparison of the two nucleic acid populations. For each sample, a dye-swap (duplicate measurement) was performed to avoid asymmetry of marker affinity (Cy3 and Cy5). The two results were averaged before statistical results. The 5 μg of aaRNA were completely vacuum-dried and resuspended in 9 μL of coupling buffer and 11 μL of dye, the tubes were mixed by vortexing and incubated for 30 minutes in the dark. The reaction was quenched by addition of 0.73 M Hydroxylamine and incubation for 15 minutes in the dark. Excess dye was removed from the labeled aaRNA by purification on a column. Purified labeled aaRNA were subsequently mixed with 10 μg poly (A) RNA, 10 μg yeast tRNA, 10 μg Cot 1 mouse RNA, then precipitated with 0.5 volumes of 7.5 M ammonium acetate and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 45 minutes to 1 hour at 4°C, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed once with 700 μL of 70% ethanol. The samples were centrifuged at 16000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The aaRNA pellet was vacuum-dried for 1 minute and then dissolved in 50 μL of the hybridization mix preheated at 50°C: 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1% Salmon sperm DNA. It was mixed by vortexing and incubated in a water bath at 50°C to dissolve the mRNA pellet. Each slide was rehydrated in a humidified chamber for 1 hour at room temperature then dried in a dessicator for 1 hour. The slides were prehybridized in 0.3% Ethanolamine and 0.05 M Na Borate pH9. The slides were plunged 1 minute in water and dried by centrifugation for 7 minutes at 100 × g. The probe was heated for 2 minutes at 100°C and placed between the slide and a cover slip. The arrays were incubated overnight in a water bath at 50°C in a humidified slide chamber and washed in a first solution of 0.1 × SSC with 0.1% SDS for 5 minutes followed by two washing steps in 0.1× SSC for 5 minutes each at room temperature, under agitation and safe from the light. The arrays were dried by centrifugation at 100 × g for 7 minutes. The image of fluorescence intensities of Cy3 (532 nm) and Cy5 (635 nm) were scanned separately with the laser scanner (GenePix® 4000B). The tiff images (10 μm/pixel) were analyzed using a specific software for microarray image analysis (GenePix® Pro 6.0 software) which allowed locating the spots automatically with manual control and quantifying the fluorescence intensity of each spot. For each microarray, the data output were the fluorescence intensities of all the spots corresponding to each gene. These data were imported in a genomic data analysis software (Gene Spring® software) to normalize the data before filtering and statistical analysis. For each sample (horse), a duplicate analysis (dye-swap) was made and the average fluorescence results were used. Then, all the results were normalized per spot and per microarray by the Lowess regression method in order to remove systematic variations. Finally, for each sample and each gene an expression ratio was obtained: Ratio = Expression of each PSSM muscle/expression in the reference control muscle For statistical analysis, a log transformation ratio was used to normalize the distribution. A list of the significant genes were obtained by filtering the genes with a cut-off t-test p-value p < 0.05 with Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing correction method to avoid a false discovery rate [25]. The Student t-test detected the mean expression ratio of replicates which are significantly different from one (expression ratio = 1, means no gene expression change).Real time quantitative RT-PCR In order to validate the equine microarray results, quantitative RT-PCR were conducted in triplicate for the top ten up and down-regulated gene transcripts both in control and PSSM horses. The primers were designed using Primer express software (Applied Biosystem) (Table 1). All the reactions were carried out on the real time PCR system 7500 (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, reverse transcription was performed on 20 ng of aaRNA obtained by aminoallyl amplification (RNA used for microarray hybidization and RT-PCR were issued from the same preparation). Random primers (100 ng) and 10 pmol of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP were added to RNA in a 13 μL final volume. The reaction tubes were incubated at 70°C for 5 min. The random annealing primer was performed by an incubation at room temperature (~25°C) for 10 min. Four microliters of 5× first strand buffer, 200 pmol of DTT and 200 U of Superscript II reverse transcriptase were added in the tube for a 20 μL final volume and incubated at 42°C for 1 hour. The enzyme was inactivated by incubating the mixture at 70°C for 15 min. The cDNA concentration was measured by optical density with a spectrometer that measured absorbance at 260 and 280 nm (Nanodrop®). The equine cDNA solution was diluted in water to obtain a final concentration of 20 ng/μL and stored at -20°C. Complementary DNA (100 ng) obtained from aaRNA was amplified in a 20 μL PCR reaction with 10 μmol of each specific primer and 10 μL SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix. Amplification steps were as follows: 10 min denaturation at 95°C, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s and annealing extension at 60°C for 1 min. The comparative threshold cycle (CT) method was used for the calculation of amplification as specified by the manufacturer. The expression results of the quantitative RT-PCR of the control and PSSM horses were normalized by the mean CT of the reference gene 12S rRNA measured in all the muscle samples and the relative expression ratio of PSSM against the control group was calculated.Table 1 List of the primers used for real time quantitative RT-PCR.GenePrimer namePrimer sequenceLengthSalt TmGC%IL18IL18_1FwdTGCATTAGCTTGGTGGAAATG216142IL18_1RevAGGTTCAAGCCTGCCAAAGT206150CTSSCTSS_1FwdACAACGGCATCGATTCAGAC206150CTSS_1RevGCCAAAGGGAAGTTCGGTAT206050LUMLUM_1FwdCCTGGAGGTCAATGAACTTGAA226145LUM_1RevACGCAAATGCTTGATCTTGG206145CD44CD44_1FwdGATCCACCCCAACTCCATCT206155CD44_1RevTGACCGAGGTGCAGTCTTCT206155FN1FN1_1FwdCCCTGGTGTCACAGAGGCTA206160FN1_1RevAGTTGGGGAGGCTCATCTGT206155GSTO1GSTO1_1FwdTACCTCATCTGGCCCTGGTT206255GSTO1_1RevATGGCTTCCATCCAGAGCTT206155VCAM1VCAM1_1FwdGCACTGCCATTGAGATGTGA206150VCAM1_1RevTGCAATGTTGCTATGGCTCA206145ITGB1ITGB1_1FwdTCTCCAGAAGGTGGCTTTGA206150ITGB1_1RevTCCGTGGAAAATACCAGCAG206150CXCR4CXCR4_1FwdGCAGCAGCAGGTAGCAAAGT206155CXCR4_1RevCCACGTCATCCTCCGTGTAG206160HIF1AHIF1A_1FwdGGACTCGGATCATCTGACCA206155HIF1A_1RevTATCCCCCTCTTTTGGCAAG206150NFKBIBNFKBIB_1FwdCGTCATCCACAAAGATGCAG206050NFKBIB_1RevCTGGGCCTCAACAGCCTAGT206260PLCG2PLCG2_1FwdCATCTTGTACGGCACCCAGT206155PLCG2_1RevTTCAAGCCAGACAGCCACTT206150ND3ND3fwdCCACAACTAAACATCTATGCAGAAAAA276233ND3revGGAGGCGTGCTGACCCTAT196263SLC25a17SLC25a17_1FwdGCAATCTGGGTCAAAGGTCA206150SLC25a17_1RevGCCCCTTGCAGCTTTAGTCT206155SRISRI_1FwdATTGCCGGAGGATACAAACC206150SRI_1RevGCCATTCAGTACAGCCCAGA206155ND5ND5fwdGATGATGATACGGCCGAACAG216152ND5revCCCGATGCGGTTATAAAGGA205850PDE4DPDE4D_1FwdAGCCTGCGAACTGTACGAAA206150PDE4D_1RevATGGATGGTTGGTTGCACAT206145SLC25a15SLC25a15_1FwdTGAACTGAGCCGATCGTTTT206145SLC25a15_1RevCAGAGGCAGATTCCACCAAC206155VEGFVEGF_1FwdTCTACCTCCACCATGCCAAG206155VEGF_1RevGTCTCGATTGGACGGCAGTA206155PRKCAPRKCA_1FwdGACTTCATGGGCTCCCTTTC206155PRKCA_1RevTCTTCGTCCCCTTCTGGAAT206150SLC2A2SLC2A2_1FwdGCCATCGGTACTCTTCACCA206155SLC2A2_1RevTGTGCCACAGCTTCTGATTG206150Data mining A biological interpretation of the data was performed using two types of analysis to identify the main biological functions and the main metabolic pathway disorders revealed by the expression profile of the PSSM muscles. The categorization of the gene functions was generated through the use of Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis . The analysis identified the biological functions that were the most significant to the gene list results. The significant genes associated with biological functions in the knowledge database (gene functions described in published papers) were considered for the analysis. The Fischer exact test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that each biological function assigned to that data set is due to chance alone. The analysis of the main metabolic pathways and their dysfunctions was performed using a Java/Perl software, Predictsearch® (Prediguard, ) which has been previously described in [26]. This software allows the characterization of the pathways as well as the functional networks in which the selected genes were involved. Briefly, gene aliases corresponding to the significant modulated genes were submitted as queries to PubMed in order to collect titles and abstracts of all related publications. The results are presented in a 2D graph that shows the relationships between each gene and cell type, cellular compartment, and biological function.ResultsGenotypes and histological phenotypes The PSSM horse genotypes for the GYS1 c.926G>A mutation were 5 heterozygous (AG) and 2 homozygous (AA) (Table 2). The 6 control horses were wild type (GG). Heterozygosity seemed to be consistent with the dominant mode of inheritance.Table 2 Genotype of GYS1 mutation and histological data of the horses.HorsePSSM disease statusGenotypeHistological gradingAge (years)SexVacuolized fibers (%)InflammationNecrosisCentral nucleiAnisocytosisLipomatosisAggregate containing fibers (%)100GG16MND0290GG15M00350GG8M00400GG8M00560GG6F00340GG10M0038PSSMGA112M14.1mildmildnumerousmildnone2.554PSSMGA14F2.5nonenoneseveralminimalmild2.412PSSMGA217M7.3mildmildnumerousmildmild20.632PSSMGA26M1.4mildnoneseveralmildnone17.042PSSMGA29FNDminimalmildseveralmildmild9.944PSSMAA217F21.9mildsevereseveralseveremild10.549PSSMAA210M34.1severeseverenumerousseveresevere18.9 Genotypes: GG = wild type, GA = heterozygous, AA = homozygous Intracytoplasmic presence of amylase-resistant material, used as diagnosis criteria for PSSM, was observed in biopsies of the 7 out of the 13 horses (Figure 1). Two horses were graded as mildly affected (less than 3% of fibers containing PAS positive amylase resistant material) and five horses as severely affected (10 to 20% of affected fibers) (Table 2) using quantitative evaluation of aggregate-containing fibers as previously published [1]. The two homozygous horses were histologically severely affected. Heterozygous horses could present the mild (n = 2) or the severe (n = 3) phenotype.Figure 1 Histological evaluation of muscular biopsies from Norman Cob horses. (A) Severe form of polysaccharide storage myopathy corresponding to a homozygous horse (# 44) for the GYS1 c.926 A allele. Numerous muscle fibers contained abnormal accumulation of polysaccharidic material (arrowheads). The endomysium was focally infiltrated by mononuclear cells (°), some adipocytes (*) and was diffusely thickened by fibrosis (arrows). (B) Mild form of polysaccharide storage myopathy corresponding to a heterozygous horse (# 54) for the GYS1 c.926 A allele. Compared to the severe form of the disease, the number of polysaccharide containing fibers (arrowheads) was lower and the endomysium was subnormal except for some fatty infiltration (°). (C) Muscle aspect of a control horse (#56). (A-C) Hematoxylin-eosin-safranine staining. Some other myopathic changes were also identified in affected horses with marked individual variations. Numerous fibers underwent segmental necrosis that was associated with mononuclear cell infiltration foci (Figure 1). Some of these foci were centered on fragmented fibers with many macrophages phagocytizing cellular necrotic debris. Strikingly, fiber necrosis was more prominent in homozygous PSSM horses. In this marked inflammatory context, some endomysial fibrosis was also present. Additionally, in all PSSM muscles, we noted an increased number of central nuclei. This change corresponds to muscular regeneration. Some degree of anisocytosis of muscular fibers was always present in affected muscles and was more severe in the two homozygous horses. Fatty infiltration of muscular fascia and replacement of muscle fibers by adipose tissue was also sometimes observed, this change being particularly severe in one homozygous horse. Ultrastructural evaluation of one severely affected horse (#49) was performed (Figure 2). Extensive accumulation of an abnormal polysaccharide appearing as dense particles, displaced and partially replaced mitochondria and myofibrils, a number of which was severely decreased. This accumulation was exclusively cytoplasmic, membrane unbound and particularly abundant around nuclei and in the subsarcolemmal region of the cytoplasm, where numerous mitochondria are normally present in sound animals. Strikingly, we also reported some mitochondrial ultrastructural changes, namely a decrease of the cristae number, formation of myelinic bodies and swelling.Figure 2 Ultrastructural evaluation of muscular biopsy from a PSSM affected Norman Cob horse #49. (A) Transversal section. (B) Longitudinal section. Severe mitochondrial (m) and myofibrillar (f) loss due to abnormal accumulation of granular material (arrowhead) resembling glycogen. Some myelinic bodies (arrow) were present that demonstrated mitochondrial degeneration. A nucleus is indicated (n).Gene transcript expressions Thirty-three percent of the probes of the micorarray were significantly hybridized with a high fluorescence value, especially for mitochondrial genes. All the data of the present study have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE15572 . After filtering the normalized expression ratios with a cut-off at p < 0.05 (normalized ratio significantly different from 1), a total of 129 genes exhibited significant changes of expression levels between PSSM and control muscles (Table 3). This set contained 16 up-regulated genes (normalized ratio > 1.5), 37 down-regulated genes (normalized ratio < 0.66) and 76 moderately modulated genes (0.66 < normalized ratio < 0.9 and 1.07 < normalized ratio < 1.5). This list of significant genes was used for the rest of the study. The maximal up-regulation value was observed for interleukin 18 (IL18) 6.2 fold change, and the following genes were up-regulated up to 2 fold: CTSS, LUM, CD44, FN1, GST01. The maximum down regulation was observed for the mitochondrial tRNA genes (TRNQ, TRNC, TRNN, TRNY, TRNA) from -4.83 to -2.86 fold changes. The three most down-regulated genes coding for proteins were the following: SLC2A2 or GLUT2 (-2.84), PRKCα (-2.72), VEGFα (-2.68).Table 3 List of significant modulated genes (p < 0.05) expressed in the muscles suffering from PSSM.Gene nameEST – SequenceEntrez GeneNormalized ratioP-value < 0.05IL18Y1113136066.201.58E-03CTSSCD46445115203.173.24E-03LUMCX59460740603.158.40E-04CD44CD4648879602.429.56E-04FN1ECU5210823352.175.10E-03GSTO1CX60386794462.032.64E-03VCAM1CX60248474121.982.76E-02ITGB1CX59872736881.872.31E-03CXCR4CD46632478521.812.74E-02HIF1ACX60227030911.731.36E-03ITGB2CD53522836891.704.26E-04HSPA5CX60460733091.691.42E-02GNASBM73497527781.631.45E-03CD69CD5286069691.622.67E-02LTFECA01093040571.581.73E-02GSK3BCX59280829321.502.60E-03APPCX6013503511.401.04E-02CATCD4643328471.396.36E-03ENO1CX60365720231.397.60E-03VAV1BI96175974091.372.70E-03MYLKCX59294146381.355.21E-02EPOAB10003020561.346.91E-03IL15AY68284936001.344.57E-03ITGALCD46425436831.321.32E-02CD40AY5140179581.304.73E-02ACTN2AB178951881.291.76E-02GDF8AB03354126601.294.87E-02DAG1CX60057816051.281.20E-02IGF2U1124134811.282.61E-02HCKBM73469430551.272.45E-02ACAA2CX603916104491.251.67E-02COMTAB17828413121.234.70E-04FLIICX60487623141.212.73E-02ATP5a1DN5091434981.215.18E-02MYL9CX594102103981.181.56E-02CCL13ECA25118863571.171.04E-02GJA5AY00878827021.075.07E-02ATP5C1CX5932635090.904.87E-02PYGLCX59778858360.902.66E-02FGRCD47058422680.884.71E-02MRPL49CD4691267400.875.00E-02GOT2CX60231728060.874.82E-02ALOX5APCD5363222410.861.95E-02IMMTCX597479108890.854.56E-02ECHS1CX60435718920.854.05E-03SLC2A1DQ13987565130.856.96E-03CYTBX7954745190.851.98E-02EDN1AY73062919060.844.03E-02PNMTAB07142254090.842.08E-03IL7CX59262235740.844.32E-02IDH2CX60471334180.831.09E-02PTGER4DN50565657340.831.72E-05IL6STDN50751135720.834.34E-04SCN4AECU2599063290.823.11E-02CEBPBCX60542310510.828.99E-03SHMT2CX60584564720.822.08E-03GLSCX60024427440.817.01E-03CYP19A1ECA01261015880.813.23E-02PLAUCD47128853280.813.89E-03SLC25a5DN5068102920.815.66E-03ATP5oDN5096175390.801.98E-02NQO1DN50825417280.802.44E-04FYNCD52843025340.781.17E-02SLC8A1DQ17864065460.781.98E-03HNRPKCX59840131900.774.69E-05Leu-ARNt_TRNL1X7954745670.771.58E-03MIFCX59969742820.771.05E-02ND2X7954745360.763.34E-03CYTBX7954745190.767.85E-03OPRM1ECA51953549880.761.07E-04CSF1CD46955014350.757.13E-04RELBCD47219759710.755.86E-05Met-ARNt_TRNMX7954745690.743.31E-03SSPNCX60571880820.721.65E-02COX 3X7954745140.725.08E-03CPT2CX59975713760.721.49E-04PDE4BCD47072051420.724.70E-06ATP5eDN5096525140.721.22E-02NR3C1CX59775629080.721.89E-02STAT6CD46727667780.721.91E-02ND2X7954745360.721.09E-04COX 3X7954745140.702.46E-03ND6X7954745410.704.69E-05OXTRBM73487050210.699.30E-04ATP1B1DN5112014810.692.20E-04ATP5jDN5073065220.694.03E-02PLGBM78046153400.693.21E-04COX 2X7954745130.691.03E-02PKM2CX60402753150.691.82E-02ATP5hCX599509104760.691.20E-03ATP5dCX6032875130.694.65E-04CSF3AF50336514400.681.84E-05Phe-ARNt_TRNFX7954745580.674.07E-05Glu-ARNt_TRNEX7954745560.672.98E-06TNFRSF4CD46506372930.666.88E-04IGHEECA30504634970.664.10E-05ATP5lCX603854106320.664.69E-03UCP2CD52853273510.668.40E-03Lys-ARNt_TRNKX7954745660.651.60E-03ND3X7954745370.641.12E-03ND6X7954745410.637.60E-05ATP2A1AF4892784870.625.98E-04TNFSF13BCD470712106730.621.95E-05Gly-ARNt_TRNGX7954745630.624.97E-03NFKBIBCX60129447930.599.31E-06PLCG2CX60345853360.587.89E-08ND5X7954745400.571.01E-05ND3X7954745370.571.65E-05SLC25a17CX598253104780.572.13E-06SRIDN50680267170.574.60E-06Val-ARNt_TRNVX7954745770.561.95E-04Asp-ARNt_TRNDX7954745550.551.76E-05ND5X7954745400.541.39E-05PDE4DCX59324151440.541.26E-06Ser-ARNt_TRNS2X7954745750.506.05E-03Ile-ARNt_TRNIX7954745650.491.21E-03SLC25a15CX598538101660.484.95E-02Leu-ARNt_TRNL2X7954745680.441.13E-05Trp-ARNt_TRNWX7954745780.402.13E-06Thr-ARNt_TRNTX7954745760.405.63E-05Pro-ARNt_TRNPX7954745710.392.59E-06VEGFAB05335074220.371.32E-06PRKCACX60289255780.372.18E-06SLC2A2AJ71598365140.352.18E-06Ala-ARNt_TRNAX7954745530.351.10E-04Tyr-ARNt_TRNYX7954745790.351.04E-03Asn-ARNt_TRNNX7954745700.338.13E-06Cys-ARNt_TRNCX7954745110.284.48E-06Gln-ARNt_TRNQX7954745720.213.81E-07 Significant p-value (p < 0.05) indicated that the expression ratio was significantly different from 1. P-values are expressed in scientific format: 1E-3 means 1.10-3. The relative expression ratio of the top ten genes up- or down-regulated between PSSM and the control group were compared to the results obtained by microarray analysis (Table 4). A significant correlation of r = 0.54 (p < 0.01) between the two methods was calculated. As in microarray results, the mitochondrial genes ND3 and ND5 were found down-regulated using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The hypoxia markers were also in agreement: VEGFα was down-regulated and HIF1α was up-regulated. All inflammation markers (IL18, CTSS, LUM, CD44, GSTO1, VCAM1, ITGB1, CXCR4) were up-regulated as in microarray results except FN1 and ITGB1 which were found down-regulated.

Protein synthesis, apoptosis, cellular movement, growth and proliferation are the main significant cellular functions (p < 0.05) that are associated to the modulated genes (Figure 3). The main significant (p < 0.05) canonical pathways concerned oxidative phosphorylation, ubiquinone biosythesis, aminosugar and purine metabolism. The main significant signaling pathways (p < 0.05) were related to G-protein couple receptor, hypoxia, NF-κB, VEGFα and IL6, IL10, apoptosis and leukocyte extravasation signaling. The main metabolic disorders significantly (p < 3.3 10-4) detected were mitochondrial dysfunction, hypoxia and alteration of NF-κB activity.Figure 3 Categories of cellular gene functions. Our list of modulated genes was classified by categories of cellular functions using a data mining software (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis®). The analysis identified the biological functions that were the most significant to the gene list results. The significant genes associated with biological functions in the knowledge database (gene functions described in published papers) were considered for the analysis. The Fischer exact test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that each biological function assigned to that data set is due to chance alone. In the present figure, protein synthesis, apoptosis, cellular movement, growth and proliferation are the main significant cellular functions (p < 0.05) that are associated to the modulated genes. The main tissue, organ and cellular context and the biological activities that were cited in relationship with the set of genes were further investigated using Predictsearch® analysis. Using the PubMed database, it was found that a part of the significant modulated genes were strongly associated with the following terms: skeletal muscle, mitochondria, myoblast, endoplasmic reticulum. (Figure 4). In addition, the more frequent biological activities cited in relationship with the set of genes were glycolysis, respiratory chain, hypoxia, glycogen synthase, inflammatory myopathy (Figure 5). The main metabolic pathway disorders are described in the figures 6, 7 and 8 using these data (see Additional file 2 for the legends of the pathway drawings). In the mitochondria, all the genes were down regulated (Figure 6). The tRNA were severely down regulated (fold change between -4.83 and -2.27). The other mitochondrial genes ND2, ND3, ND5, ND6, COX2 and COX3 were moderately down regulated but with low expression values (fold changes between -1.31 and -1.85). Other nuclear genes involved in the aerobic metabolism of the mitochondria were down regulated as well: UCP2, GNAS, SLC25a15, SLC2a2 (GLUT2), ATP5L, ATP5J, ATP5D and ATP5H.Figure 4 Relationships between pairs of genes and cellular compartments. The analysis of the main metabolic pathways and their dysfunctions was performed using a data mining software (Predictsearch®). Briefly, gene aliases corresponding to the significant modulated genes were submitted as queries to PubMed in order to collect titles and abstracts of all related publications. The results showed that a part of the significant modulated genes were strongly associated with the following terms: skeletal muscle, mitochondria, myoblast, endoplasmic reticulum.Figure 5 Relationships between metabolic pathways or disorders and genes.

Mitochondria is one of the compartment detected by electronic microscopy and data mining as illustrated in figure 4. In the mitochondria, the tRNA were severely down regulated (fold change between -4.83 and -2.27). The other mitochondrial genes ND2, ND3, ND5, ND6, COX2 and COX3 were moderately down-regulated but with low expression values (fold changes between -1.31 and -1.85). Other nuclear genes involved in the aerobic metabolism of the mitochondria were down regulated as well: UCP2, GNAS, SLC25a15, SLC2a2 (GLUT2), ATP5L, ATP5J, ATP5D and ATP5H. The PubMed ID of the related publications found by the data mining analysis were indicated on the figure (8611159; 7533543; 2988521).Figure 7 Inflammatory process. The chronic inflammation of the PSSM muscle was revealed both by histological observations and the number of up-regulated genes involved in inflammation pathways as illustrated in data mining results figure 5: IL18, CD44, CD69, CTSS, FN1, HSPA5, ITGB1, ITGB2, VCAM, CXCR4, LTF, GSTO1 and LUM. These genes could be expressed in the leukocytes present in the PSSM muscle and/or in muscle fibers. The PubMed ID of the related publications found by the data mining analysis were indicated on the figure (15574430; 15661938; 12742663; 12101280; 15019705; 2988521; 11890723).Figure 8 Relationships between inflammatory process, inhibition of glycogen synthase and hypoxia according to data mining Results of figure 5. The up-regulation of the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3β) under its active form was responsible for the glycogen synthase (GYS1) inhibition. The up-regulation of GSK3β has another effect on hypoxia and low capillarization of the PSSM muscle. Phosphorylation of GSK3β increases the HIF1α destabilization which is degraded in the proteasome. Consequently, the low expression of HIF1α down-regulates VEGFα expression which contributes to a poor capillarization and increases chronic hypoxia of the regenerated muscle fibers. The PubMed ID of the related publications found by the data mining analysis were indicated on the figure (16464907; 15574430; 15227652; 15642371; 12764143; 11890723; 11029398). A chronic inflammation process of the muscle was revealed by many up-regulated genes like interleukin 18 (IL18), CD44, CD69, CTSS, FN1, HSPA5, ITGB1, ITGB2, VCAM, CXCR4 LTF, GSTO1 and LUM (Figure 7). The up-regulation of the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3β) under its active form could be responsible for glycogen synthase inhibition, and for hypoxic transcription factor inhibition (HIF1α) by phosphorylation as indicated by data mining analysis (Figure 8). In addition, VEGFα was down-regulated and avoided capillarization and oxygen distribution of the new regenerated muscle fibers. These gene regulations increased muscle hypoxia. Other interesting genes were slightly up-regulated: ENO1 (1.39) was involved in the end of glycolysis; IGF2 (1.34) was involved in the growth hormone activity in muscle differentiation; EPO (1.28) was involved in hematopoietic function. Some other genes were slightly down-regulated: PYGL (-1.11) was involved in glycogen metabolism; IL6ST (-1.20), IL7 (-1.19) were involved in hematoprotein signaling; MIF (-1.30) was involved in cell inflammatory regulation. GSK3β, PYGL, GLUT2 are the only genes closely related to glycogen metabolism.Discussion The equine genome has been recently sequenced and published. However, there is no equine DNA microarray commercially available to date. Three homemade cDNA microarrays have been designed using transcripts extracted from equine joint cartilage and synoviocytes [27-29]. This first cDNA microarray was tissue specific and poorly annotated. Another approach to analyse gene expression in equine leukocytes and muscles was to use a heterologous 15 K cDNA microarray designed from murine embryonic tissues by the National Institute on Aging [30]. It includes 15,264 unique genes for which about 11,000 are annotated. It has been demonstrated by several tests that mouse cDNA microarrays can adequately hybridize equine genes expressed in muscles [31]. It was assumed that interspecific hybridization between an equine cDNA and a probe of 1,500 nucleotide length is possible between two mammal species because the genes involved in the basic cellular functions are highly conserved during mammal evolution as observed for myosin heavy chains [32]. The same mouse 15 K cDNA microarray has been used to detect inflammation and oxidative stress by the study of leukocyte gene expression in endurance horses performing a race of 140 km [33]. In order to improve specificity of the hybridization and to focus on a few numbers of functions of the genes (inflammation, muscle metabolism), an equine oligonucleotide microarray database was designed and validated according to the same methods as previously described [24,31]. The muscle biopsies mainly collected muscle fiber cells and also some leucocytes that were in the muscular blood vessels and in the muscle connective tissue itself because of chronic inflammation observed in PSSM muscles. Histological data showed mild or severe inflammation with macrophages and lymphocyte infiltration. These leucocytes should have an important signaling activity which was observed in the present results. However, the relative amount of muscle RNA extracted from the muscle was more than 98% of the total RNA according to the relative mass of tissue. In addition, very little blood was collected with the automatic biopsy needle and the blood at the surface of the sample was absorbed before freezing the biopsy into nitrogen. The gene expression analysis of the PSSM muscles mainly revealed the metabolic disorders due to this equine glycogenosis but not directly the genes suspected to be responsible for this pathology. The candidates GBE1, PFKM, AGL and even GYS1 were not significantly modulated. GYS1 with a G-to-A mutation has been identified to be associated with PSSM in different breeds [21]. Most of the PSSM cases (77) diagnosed by histology were heterozygous for the mutation but 22 PSSM cases were of the homozygous wild type and the GYS1 mutation alone could not explain the glycogenosis. It has been suggested that another non-GYS1 glycogenosis could explain these 22 PSSM cases. The glycogen synthase activity measured in vitro was higher in PSSM muscle. In the present study, all the PSSM horses were mutated for GYS1. The homozygous horses exhibited more severe histological disorders with characteristic amylase-resistant aggregates but also tissular damages, namely fiber necrosis, anisocytosis, some endomysial fibrosis and fatty infiltration. The main dysfunctions observed were a chronic inflammatory myopathy and a severe hypoxia associated with a very low activity of the oxidative energetic metabolism. The chronic inflammation of the PSSM muscle was revealed both by histological observations and the number of up-regulated genes involved in inflammation pathways: IL18, CD44, CD69, CTSS, FN1, HSPA5, ITGB1, ITGB2, VCAM, CXCR4, LTF, GSTO1 and LUM. These genes could be expressed in the leukocytes present in the PSSM muscle and/or in muscle fibers. Interleukin 18 (IL18) was the most up-regulated gene and four other genes had the highest expression ratios: CTSS, LUM, CD44 and FN1. The chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been observed more specifically in some idiopathic inflammatory myopathies in humans [34]. This gene encodes a CXC chemokine receptor specific for stromal cell-derived factor-1. This protein has 7 transmembrane regions and is located on the cell surface. According to the histological data, it was postulated that this inflammatory context was stimulated by muscle fiber necrosis and progressed to fiber regeneration and endomysial fibrosis. This mecanism is illustrated by (i) the insulin like growth hormone type II (IGF2) that was also up-regulated and contributed to myoblast differentiation [35] and mitochondrial biogenesis [36]; (ii) the up-regulation of lumican (LUM) gene that encodes for a small keratan sulfate proteoglycan molecule, which is involved in the collagen fibrillogenesis and fibrous tissue formation. IL18 is an interferon gamma-induced protein that is involved in immune cell activation, proliferation, infiltration, apoptosis and cytotoxicity. In humans, the plasmatic concentration of IL18 is an interesting predictor of the risk of myocardial infarction, artherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome observed in obesity [37,38]. A high plasmatic concentration of IL18 is correlated with insulin resistance and body mass index. In PSSM horses, an increased sensitivity to insulin has also been observed [14]. The measure of IL18 concentration could be an interesting blood marker of PSSM. As indicated by the data mining analysis, the chronic inflammation and IL18 up-regulation could be responsible of PI3K/Akt/GSK3β activation [39]. The up-regulation GSK3β under its active form could be responsible for the glycogen synthase (GYS1) inhibition as indicated by data mining analysis. The down-regulation of the glycogen metabolism was also indicated by a low expression value of PYGL. The up-regulation of active GSK3β could be responsible of hypoxia and low capillarization of the PSSM muscle. The GSK3β activity increases the HIF1α destabilization by phosphorylation which is finally degraded in the proteasome [39,40]. Consequently, the low expression of HIF1α should down-regulate VEGFα expression [41] which contributes to a poor capillarization and increased chronic hypoxia of the regenerated muscle fibers. The down-regulated protein kinase Cα (PRKCα) gene is involved in many important signaling pathways like calcium, MAPK and VEGFα. Other genes involved in hematoprotein signaling were down-regulated IL6ST, IL7. It was interesting to observe the up-regulation of the erythropoietin cytokine gene (EPO), which also demonstrated hypoxia in the PSSM muscle. This EPO transcript could be expressed both in blood and muscle cells. This plasmatic cytokine is well known to regulate red cell production by promoting erythroid differentiation and initiating hemoglobin synthesis. This cytokine also has neuroprotective activity and an anti-apoptotic neuronal effect useful for treatment of a variety of potential brain injuries [42,43]. The use of EPO in chronic kidney disease [44], heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases [45] demonstrated the pleiotropic cytokine activity of EPO as anti-apoptotic and with a tissue protective effect against hypoxia. Erythropoietin injection could be useful for the treatment of hypoxia in PSSM cases. Hypoxia could also be related to the severe oxidative metabolism dysfunction observed at the mitochondrial level. Ultrastructural observations showed a decrease in the number of mitochondria and mitochondrial damages with reduction the cristae number, swelling and formation of myelinic bodies. The genomic markers of the mitochondrial dysfunction were the low level of most of the tRNA and the down-regulated genes coding for the respiratory chain sub-units (ND2, ND3, ND5, ND6, COX2 and COX3). The respiratory chain dysfunction in conjunction with a low expression of UCP2 could increase the reactive oxygen species accumulation in the mitochondria and could be responsible for muscle fiber apoptosis and necrosis. In addition, other nuclear genes involved in the mitochondrial oxidative metabolism were down-regulated (GNAS, SLC25A15, SLC2a2 (GLUT2), ATP5L, ATP5J, ATP5D and ATP5H). The down-regulation of the glucose transporter GLUT2 could also be related to the hypoxia. This transporter facilitates bidirectional transport of glucose through the cellular membrane and decreases the glucose available for glycogen synthesis, glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. The mitochondrial carrier ornithine transporter (SLC25A15) down-regulation also indicates a reduction of mitochondrial activity.Conclusion Protein synthesis, apoptosis, cellular movement, growth and proliferation were the main cellular functions associated with the modulated genes. This was in agreement with the histological observations of active muscle fiber regeneration in PSSM muscles. Several up-regulated genes, especially interleukine 18 (IL18), revealed a severe muscular inflammation in PSSM muscles as confirmed by histological findings of leucocyte infiltrations. The up-regulation of active glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3β) could be responsible for both glycogen synthase (GYS1) inhibition and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1α) destabilization. Many genes involved in mitochondrial functions were down-regulated and utltrastructural observations revealed many mitochondrial disorders. Consequently, the main disorders observed in PSSM muscles could be related to mitochondrial dysfunctions, glycogenesis inhibition and the chronic hypoxia.Authors' contributions EB designed and carried out the study and wrote the manuscript.

After administration of aprepitant (125/80 mg group [10 patients]: 125 mg on day 1 and 80 mg on days 2–5; 40/25 mg group [10 patients]: 40 mg on day 1 and 25 mg on days 2–5) and dexamethasone (6 mg on day 1 and 4 mg on days 2 and 3 in the 125/80 mg group, and 8 mg on day 1 and 6 mg on days 2 and 3 in the 40/25 mg group) to Japanese cancer patients receiving at least moderately emetogenic antitumor agents, the plasma concentrations of aprepitant, dexamethasone, and substance P were measured. All of 20 patients were treated with the highly emetogenic agent cisplatin (≥70 mg/m2). The Cmax and AUC0–24 h of aprepitant in Japanese cancer patients were similar with those in non-Japanese patients. The clearance of dexamethasone in the 125/80 mg group was approximately one-half of that previously determined in the absence of aprepitant. The substance P concentration in plasma significantly increased only in patients with delayed nausea/vomiting. This study demonstrated similar plasma pharmacokinetics of aprepitant in Japanese and non-Japanese, the validity of reducing dexamethasone dose, and the existence of increased plasma substance P concentration in patients receiving highly emetogenic cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

Introduction Aprepitant is a neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist developed as a treatment for both acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It has a novel mechanism of action (i.e., by inhibiting the binding of substance P to the NK1 receptor in the vomiting center) [1–3]. In the guidelines for management of CINV, aprepitant is recommended to be used in combination with a serotonin antagonist and dexamethasone to prevent nausea/vomiting induced by highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy [4–6]. Although aprepitant has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of serotonin antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron, palonosetron) [7, 8], aprepitant inhibits CYP3A4 and in turn inhibits the metabolism of dexamethasone, a substrate of CYP3A4 [9]. It has been shown that the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) of dexamethasone is increased approximately two times after administration of aprepitant at a dose of 125 mg on day 1 and at a dose of 80 mg on days 2–5 in healthy adults, and so, to maintain dexamethasone at the prescribed blood level in the presence of aprepitant, the dose of dexamethasone has to be reduced by 50% [9]. Although a previous population pharmacokinetic study of dexamethasone combined with aprepitant supported the validity of this dose reduction of dexamethasone [10], there has been no full pharmacokinetic study of dexamethasone and aprepitant in cancer patients who receive emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. While aprepitant may have an antiemetic effect by inhibiting the binding of substance P to the NK1 receptor in the vomiting center as mentioned above, it is still unclear whether there is any change in the in vivo kinetics of substance P after administration of chemotherapeutic agents, or how the in vivo kinetics of substance P is related to CINV. This study was conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant as well as dexamethasone in Japanese cancer patients and to verify the dose reduction of dexamethasone used in combination with aprepitant, and furthermore, to evaluate the relationship between CINV and in vivo kinetics of substance P after administration of chemotherapeutic agents.Patients and methodsInclusion criteria Japanese cancer patients aged between 20 and 74 years who received cancer chemotherapy were included in this study. Cancer chemotherapy consisted of at least moderately (Hesketh level ≥ 3 [11]) emetogenic chemotherapeutic agents on day 1 only. With a performance status of 0–2 and an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months, patients met the following laboratory criteria: white blood cell count ≥ 3,000/mm3 and neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3; platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3; AST (GOT) and ALT (GPT) ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of the normal range at the facility; ALP ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of the normal range at the facility; total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL; and creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL. The following patients were excluded from the study: patients with a risk of vomiting for other reasons (symptomatic brain metastasis, meningeal infiltration, epilepsy, active peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal obstruction, concomitant abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy, etc.); and pregnant, nursing, or possibly pregnant women. After the protocol and informed consent form were approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at the facility, patients who gave written informed consent were enrolled. All studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the basic principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.Design and treatment This was an open-label study. A total of 20 patients were randomized to receive aprepitant at an oral dose of 125/80 mg (125 mg on day 1 and 80 mg on days 2–5; n = 10) or 40/25 mg (40 mg on day 1 and 25 mg on days 2–5; n = 10). In addition, all patients received standard antiemetic therapy consisting of intravenous granisetron (40 μg/kg on day 1) and intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate (on days 1–3). In this study, the dose of intravenous dexamethasone was 6 mg on day 1 and 4 mg on days 2 and 3 in the 125/80-mg group and 8 mg on day 1 and 6 mg on days 2 and 3 in the 40/25 mg group. Although, in the antiemetic guidelines [4–6], it is recommended that dexamethasone is administered at a dose of 12 mg on day 1 and at a dose of 8 mg on day 2 and thereafter in combination with aprepitant 125/80 mg, the dose of dexamethasone in this study was determined in order to compare the clearance of dexamethasone in this study with that obtained from Japanese cancer patients in the absence of aprepitant at a dose of 12 mg dexamethasone on day 1 [10].Pharmacokinetic evaluation Blood samples for measurement of plasma aprepitant concentration were collected before administration of aprepitant on days 1–5 and 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 11, and 24 h after administration of aprepitant on day 1 and on day 5 only. In addition, a separate set of blood samples for measurement of plasma dexamethasone concentration were collected immediately, 15 min, 30 min, and 1.5, 3.5, 7.5, 9.5, and 22.5 h after administration of dexamethasone on day 1.Methods for measurement of plasma aprepitant and dexamethasone concentrations For each subject, venous blood was collected in an EDTA 2Na-treated tube at each sampling time point and immediately centrifuged at approximately 1,500g (approximately 3,000 rpm) for 10 min at room temperature. Then, the resultant plasma was transferred to a polypropylene tube and stored frozen at −20°C. The plasma concentrations of aprepitant and dexamethasone were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). After methanol was added to plasma, the internal standard and carbonate buffer (for aprepitant) or ammonium acetate buffer (for dexamethasone) were added and mixed. Then, t-butyl methyl ether (for aprepitant) or diethyl ether (for dexamethasone) was added to and mixed with the plasma sample and centrifuged. After the aqueous layer was frozen in a methanol/dry ice bath, the entire organic layer was collected in a tube and placed under nitrogen stream at approximately 40°C to remove the solvent. The residue was suspended in ammonium acetate aqueous solution (containing formic acid)/acetonitrile (for aprepitant) or methanol/water (for dexamethasone) for use in LC/MS/MS. The pharmacokinetic parameters of aprepitant and dexamethasone were calculated by non-compartment analysis using WinNonlin Professional® software Ver.4.0.1 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax), and area under the plasma concentration–time curve from 0 to 24 h post-dose (AUC0–24 h) were calculated for aprepitant, and the Cmax, area under the plasma concentration–time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC0–∞), t1/2, total clearance (CLtot), and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) were calculated for dexamethasone.Assessment of substance P Before administration of aprepitant on days 1–5, venous blood was collected in an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)/aprotinin-treated tube from each subject and inverted to mix. After blood was immediately centrifuged at 1,500g (approximately 3,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4°C, 0.5 mL of plasma was stored frozen at –20°C. The plasma substance P concentration was measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA).Statistical analysis To assess ethnic differences in the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant, the Cmax and AUC0–24 h at a dose of 125 mg in Japanese cancer patients were compared with those in non-Japanese cancer patients [12] by calculating the geometric mean ratio (Japanese/non-Japanese) and its 90% confidence interval for each parameter. To assess the validity of adjusting the dose of dexamethasone in the 125/80 and 40/25 mg groups, the exposure levels of dexamethasone were compared. The Cmax and AUC0–∞ of dexamethasone in each group were used to calculate the geometric mean ratio (125/80 mg group/40/25 mg group) and its 90% confidence interval for each parameter. In addition, the clearance of dexamethasone in each group was compared with that calculated in the absence of aprepitant in Japanese cancer patients [10]. For substance P, the plasma concentration on each measurement day was used to assess the change on day 2 and thereafter, and these changes were evaluated by paired t test. This study was designed and funded by Ono pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Merck & Co., Inc., the manufacturer of aprepitant.ResultsPatients A total of 20 patients (10 in the 125/80 mg group and 10 in the 40/25 mg group) were included. Patients’ characteristics are shown in Table 1. There were 18, 1, and 1 patients with non–small cell lung cancer, small-cell lung cancer, and mesothelioma, respectively. All were treated with at least the highly emetogenic chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin (≥70 mg/m2). The two groups were generally similar in age, sex, height, and body weight.Table 1 Characteristics of patientsCharacteristics125/80 mg regimen n = 1040/25 mg regimen n = 10Male/female (N)6/47/3Age (years) Mean (S.D.)59.7 (6.7)63.6 (5.9) Range47–7155–72Height (cm) Mean (S.D.)161.16 (9.91)161.24 (12.97) Range147.0–179.5139.2–177.3Weight (kg) Mean (S.D.)55.72 (10.28)56.86 (14.17) Range42.2–76.642.4–82.7Primary cancer diagnosis (N) Non–small cell lung cancer99 Small-cell lung cancer10 Mesothelioma01Chemotherapy regimen (N) Cisplatin + gemcitabine35 Cisplatin + tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil22 Cisplatin + vinorelbine22 Cisplatin + etoposide20 Cisplatin + docetaxel11Pharmacokinetics of aprepitant All 20 enrolled patients were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. The pharmacokinetic parameters of aprepitant are shown in Table 2. In the 125/80 mg group, the AUC0–24 h on days 1 and 5 increased out of proportion to the dose, compared with that in the 40/25 mg group.Table 2 Summary of the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant on days 1 and 5DayParameter125/80 mg regimen40/25 mg regimen1Cmax (ng/mL)2,210 ± 870536 ± 105Tmax (h)7.0 (3.0–9.0)3.0 (2.0–9.0)AUC0–24 h (ngh/mL)30,000 ± 8,7006,360 ± 1,3505Cmax (ng/mL)3,070 ± 850453 ± 109Tmax (h)3.0 (2.0–9.0)3.0 (2.0–3.0)AUC0–24 h (ngh/mL)46,000 ± 17,1005,420 ± 1,680 Mean ± SD, Tmax median (range) Cmax, maximum plasma concentration, Tmax, time to maximum plasma concentration, AUC0–24 h area under plasma concentration–time curve from 0 to 24 h post-dose The geometric mean ratio and its 90% confidence interval (CI) of the Cmax and AUC0–24 h of aprepitant in Japanese cancer patients to non-Japanese cancer patients was 1.09 (0.79–1.52) and 1.12 (0.87–1.45), respectively, showing little differences between Japanese and non-Japanese groups in the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant.Pharmacokinetics of dexamethasone For dexamethasone, the pharmacokinetic parameters and time profile of plasma concentration on day 1 in the 125/80 and 40/25 mg groups are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 1, respectively. The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of Cmax and AUC0–∞ of dexamethasone on day 1 in the 125/80 mg group to the 40/25 mg group was 0.83 (0.73–0.94) and 1.15 (0.88–1.50), respectively, showing that although the Cmax tended to be high in the 40/25 mg group, the AUC0–∞was similar between the two treatment groups. To verify the dose reduction of dexamethasone in cancer patients who receive emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in combination with aprepitant, we compared the clearances of dexamethasone in this study with that obtained from Japanese cancer patients in the absence of aprepitant at a dose of 12 mg on day 1 (13.3 L/h) [10]. In the 125/80 and 40/25 mg groups (dexamethasone at a dose of 6 and 8 mg on day 1, respectively), the clearance of dexamethasone was 6.48 and 10.0 L/h, respectively. That is, the clearances of dexamethasone in the 125/80 and 40/25 mg groups decrease by approximately 52 and 25%, respectively. These results demonstrate the validity of reducing the dose of dexamethasone by 50 and 25% in the 125/80 and 40/25 mg groups, compared with the dose of dexamethasone in the absence of aprepitant.Table 3 Pharmacokinetic parameters of dexamethasone in each treatment group (on day 1)Parameter125/80 mg regimen (Dexamethasone 6 mg)40/25 mg regimen (Dexamethasone 8 mg)Cmax (ng/mL)121 ± 17147 ± 27AUC0–t (ngh/mL)823 ± 213838 ± 253AUC0–∞ (ngh/mL)1,020 ± 300899 ± 287t1/2 (h)9.6 ± 2.45.7 ± 1.4CLtot (L/h)6.48 ± 2.5010.0 ± 4.1Vss (L)74.6 ± 14.365.5 ± 11.7 Mean ± SD Cmax maximum plasma concentration, AUC0–t, area under plasma concentration–time curve from 0 to the last measurable concentration, AUC0–∞, area under plasma concentration–time curve from 0 to infinity, t1/2 elimination half-life, CLtot total clearance, Vss volume of distribution at steady stateFig. 1 Time profile of plasma dexamethasone concentration in each treatment group (day 1).

The substance P concentration significantly increased on days 2–4, compared with that on day 1 (baseline) (P < 0.05, paired t test).Fig. 2 Time profile of plasma substance P concentration (n = 20).

The change in substance P concentration in plasma from baseline (the concentration before the start of treatment with aprepitant) in patients with or without delayed nausea/vomiting is shown in Fig. 3. One patient had missing data for the substance P concentration on day 1, and so we analyzed the change in substance P concentration from baseline (day 1) in 19 patients. In patients with delayed nausea/vomiting, substance P concentration increased significantly between days 2 and 5 compared with baseline (day 1) (P < 0.05, paired t test). On the other hand, in patients without delayed nausea/vomiting, the increase in substance P concentration on days 2–5 was not statistically significant.Fig. 3 Change in plasma substance P concentration (n = 19).

There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant between Japanese and non-Japanese cancer patients. In addition, we showed the validity of dose adjustment of dexamethasone used in combination with aprepitant (i.e., reducing the dose of dexamethasone by 50% when combined with 125 mg of aprepitant). We also found that the blood concentration of substance P, which is deeply involved in the pharmacological effects of aprepitant, increased after administration of chemotherapeutic agents. In the present study, the geometric mean ratio of the Cmax and AUC0–24 h in Japanese cancer patients to non-Japanese cancer patients was 1.09 and 1.12, respectively, indicating no ethnic differences in the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant. In the aprepitant 125/80 mg group, more than dose-proportional increase in AUC0–24 h occurred on both days 1 and 5, compared with that in the 40/25 mg group. Aprepitant is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 [13], and this more than proportional increase in the AUC0–24 h of aprepitant may reflect saturated metabolism of aprepitant via CYP3A4 as previously reported in healthy non-Japanese volunteers [14]. In this study, granisetron hydrochloride and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were concomitantly used as standard antiemetic therapy. Aprepitant–dexamethasone interaction causes the increase in plasma dexamethasone concentration [9], and it has been suggested that this drug interaction may also cause a slight increase in the incidence of infection-related serious adverse events [15]. Since the AUC of dexamethasone (p.o.) has been shown to increase approximately two times after administration of aprepitant at a dose of 125 mg on day 1 in healthy adults [9], the dose of dexamethasone has to be reduced by 50% when used in combination with 125 mg of aprepitant. While oral dexamethasone was used in the report by McCrea et al. [9], this was the first full pharmacokinetic study of intravenous administration of dexamethasone when used in combination with aprepitant in cancer patients actually receiving chemotherapeutic agents. In the 125/80 mg group, the clearance of intravenous dexamethasone decreased by approximately 52% from that calculated in the absence of aprepitant, justifying a 50% dose reduction of intravenous dexamethasone used in combination with 125 mg of aprepitant in cancer patients as McCrea et al. demonstrated in healthy adults [9]. And the results from this full pharmacokinetic study also supported a report using a population pharmacokinetics model by Nakade et al. [10] that the clearance of intravenous dexamethasone used in combination with aprepitant at a dose of 125 mg decreased by 47.5% of that in the absence of aprepitant. While aprepitant may exert its antiemetic effect during chemotherapy, by inhibiting the binding of substance P to the NK1 receptor in the vomiting center [1], few studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between the blood pharmacokinetics of substance P and nausea/vomiting during treatment with chemotherapeutic agents in humans. Substance P has been shown to be co-localized with serotonin in enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract [16] and cross the blood–brain barrier in animals [17]. These reports raise the possibility that substance P of peripheral origin may act centrally to induce emesis. However, it is still not shown whether exocytotic release of substance P from enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract occurs after administration of emetogenic agents. This study showed that the plasma substance P concentration significantly increased on days 2–4 after administration of chemotherapeutic agents. It was also shown that the plasma substance P concentration significantly increased only in patients with delayed nausea/vomiting. These results, as well as the report from Higa [18], support the possibility that the elevation of the plasma substance P concentration by emetogenic chemotherapeutic agents may be involved in the pathogenesis of CINV, especially in the delayed phase. The plasma substance P concentration ranged from 0 to 1,608 pg/mL in a report by Higa et al. [18] and from 2–55 pg/mL in the present study. The cause of this difference is unknown, but may be attributed to different assay kits used to measure the substance P concentration (Higa et al. used R&D systems, and we used Cayman Chemical). In conclusion, this study demonstrated similar plasma pharmacokinetics of aprepitant in Japanese and non-Japanese, the validity of reducing dexamethasone dose, and the existence of increased substance P concentration in patients receiving highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Further studies are required to clarify whether measurement of the plasma pharmacokinetics of substance P may be a clinically meaningful marker for CINV in patients receiving emetogenic agents.

In the present study, we sought to examine the effectiveness of honokiol in inhibiting migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Clonogenicity and three-dimensional colony-formation assays were used to examine breast cancer cell growth with honokiol treatment. The effect of honokiol on invasion and migration of breast cancer cells was evaluated by using Matrigel invasion, scratch-migration, spheroid-migration, and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)-based migration assays. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis were used to examine activation of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) axis. Isogenic LKB1-knockdown breast cancer cell line pairs were developed. Functional importance of AMPK activation and LKB1 overexpression in the biologic effects of honokiol was examined by using AMPK-null and AMPK-wild type (WT) immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and isogenic LKB1-knockdown cell line pairs. Finally, mouse xenografts, immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of tumors were used. Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that honokiol treatment increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activity, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of the downstream target of AMPK, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and inhibition of phosphorylation of p70S6kinase (pS6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1). By using AMPK-null and AMPK-WT (MEFs), we found that AMPK is required for honokiol-mediated modulation of pACC-pS6K. Intriguingly, we discovered that honokiol treatment increased the expression and cytoplasmic translocation of tumor-suppressor LKB1 in breast cancer cells. LKB1 knockdown inhibited honokiol-mediated activation of AMPK and, more important, inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition of breast tumorigenesis . Analysis of tumors showed significant increases in the levels of cytoplasmic LKB1 and phospho-AMPK in honokiol-treated tumors. Taken together, these data provide the first and evidence of the integral role of the LKB1-AMPK axis in honokiol-mediated inhibition of the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. In conclusion, honokiol treatment could potentially be a rational therapeutic strategy for breast carcinoma.

Introduction Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women. About 226,870 new cases of invasive breast cancer and about 63,300 new cases of carcinoma in situ will be diagnosed in 2012, according to the latest estimates for breast cancer in the United States by American Cancer Society. Despite major advances in screening programs and development of various targeted therapeutic approaches, mortality related to breast cancer still remains at a staggering high level, with approximately 1 in 35 women dying of breast cancer. Available therapies, including radiation, endocrine, and conventional chemotherapy, are often limited by high toxicity, lower efficacy, therapeutic resistance, and therapy-related morbidity. Therefore, more-effective therapeutic strategies are clearly needed to combat breast cancer and to reduce morbidity and mortality. The importance of active constitutive agents in natural products has become increasingly apparent, owing to their potential cancer preventive as well as therapeutic properties [1,2]. In traditional Asian medicine, root and stem bark of Magnolia species have been used for centuries to treat anxiety, nervous disorders, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and stroke [3]. Therapeutic benefits of Magnolia species have been attributed to honokiol, a natural phenolic compound isolated from an extract of seed cones from Magnolia grandiflora [3,4]. Honokiol has shown antithrombocytic, antibacterial, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and anxiolytic effects, and it may prove beneficial against hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, thrombosis, and angiopathy [3]. Two pioneering studies showing the remarkable inhibitory effects of honokiol on mouse skin-tumor promotion and demonstrating efficacy of honokiol against established tumors in mice [5,6] ascertained the anticancer potential of honokiol. Subsequent studies showed the anticancer activities of honokiol in many cancer cell lines and tumor models [7-11]. Honokiol has been found to alter many cellular processes and to modulate molecular targets that are known to affect apoptosis, growth, and survival of tumor cells. A review of previous studies suggests that the mechanism by which honokiol causes growth arrest and cell death may be cell-line/tumor-type specific and involve many signaling pathways. For instance, Bax upregulation has been observed in some but not in other cellular systems [7,12]. Honokiol decreases phosphorylation of ERK, Akt, and c-Src to induce apoptosis effectively in SVR angiosarcoma cells [3], inhibits the ERK signaling pathway to exert antiangiogenesis activity [13], but activates ERK in cortical neurons to induce neurite outgrowth [14,15]. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), honokiol causes apoptosis through activation of caspase 8, followed by caspase 9 and 3 activation [7]. Honokiol-mediated increased cleavage of Mcl-1 and downregulation of XIAP as well as BAD upregulation is observed in multiple myeloma, whereas Bid, p-Bad, Bak, Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL remain unchanged [12]. Honokiol also inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway, thus affecting expression of many downstream genes in endothelial cells, human monocytes, lymphoma, embryonic kidney cells, promyelocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, cervical cancer, and head and neck cancer [16-19]. Thus, honokiol elicits several cellular responses and modulates multiple facets of signal transduction. In the present study, we specifically investigated the effect of honokiol on the malignant properties of breast cancer cells, including migration and invasion, and also examined the underlying molecular mechanisms. Intriguingly, we discovered that honokiol increases the expression of tumor-suppressor LKB1 to modulate the signaling pathway involving the AMPK-pS6K axis. We directly tested the requirement of AMPK and LKB1 in honokiol-mediated inhibition of malignant properties of breast cancer cells. Our results showed that LKB1 and AMPK are integral molecules required for honokiol-mediated modulation of 4EBP1-pS6K and inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.Materials and methodsCell culture and reagents The human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini Bioproducts, Woodland, CA, USA) and 2 μM L-glutamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cell-line authentication was done by analysis of known genetic markers or response (for example, expression of estrogen receptor and p53 and estrogen responsiveness) [20]. AMPK-null and AMPK-WT immortalized MEFs were kindly provided by Dr. Keith R. Laderoute (SRI International, Menlo Park, CA, USA) [21]. Honokiol is a natural product extracted from seed cone of Magnolia grandiflora, as previously described [6]. Antibodies for p-AMPK (phospho-AMPK), AMPK, ACC, p-ACC (phospho-ACC), pS6K, p-pS6K (phospho-S6K), 4EBP1, p-4EBP1 (phospho-4EBP1), p-Akt (phospho-Akt), Akt, and LKB1 (3047) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA).LKB1 stable knockdown using lentiviral short-hairpin RNA Five pre-made lentiviral LKB1 short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs and a negative control construct created in the same vector system (pLKO.1) were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL, USA). Paired LKB1 stable knockdown cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) were generated by following our previously published protocol [22].Cell-viability assay Cell-viability assay was performed by estimating the reduction of XTT (2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide), by using a commercially available kit (Roche) [23]. Breast cancer cells were treated with honokiol as indicated.Clonogenicity assay For colony-formation assay [24], MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with honokiol as indicated for 10 days; colonies containing > 50 normal-appearing cells were counted.Anchorage-independent soft-agar growth assay Anchorage-independent growth of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of honokiol treatment was determined by colony formation on soft agar [25]. Colonies were counted in five randomly selected fields at ×10 magnification by using Olympus IX50 inverted microscope.Scratch-migration assay Migration assay was performed according to our published protocol [26]. Cells were treated with honokiol as indicated. Plates were photographed after 24 and 48 hours at the identical location of the initial image.Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) wound-healing assay Wound-healing assay was performed by using the ECIS (Applied BioPhysics, Troy, NY, USA) technology and following our previously established protocol [27].Spheroid migration assay MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells (1.5 × 104) were seeded in 0.5% agar-coated plates and cultured on an orbital shaker (100 rpm) for 48 hours in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. Intact tumor spheroids were selected and transferred to six-well plates. The spheroids were treated with honokiol, as indicated. After 48 hours of incubation, spheroids were fixed with 10% buffered formalin in PBS and stained with crystal violet. The migration of cells from spheroids was observed under a light microscope.Invasion assay For an in vitro model system of metastasis, Matrigel invasion assay [28] was performed by using a Matrigel invasion chamber from BD Biocoat Cellware (San Jose, CA, USA). The slides were coded to prevent counting bias, and the number of invaded cells on representative sections of each membrane were counted under light microscope. The number of invaded cells for each experimental sample represents the average of triplicate wells.Western blotting Whole cell lysate [23] was prepared by scraping MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in 250 μl of ice-cold modified RIPA buffer. An equal amount of protein was resolved on sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blot analysis was performed. Immunodetection was performed by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions.Immunoprecipitation assay Immunoprecipitation of LKB1 was performed by following the previously published protocol [23] by using anti-LKB1 antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-STRAD antibody.Immunofluorescence and confocal imaging Breast cancer cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated in four-well chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA) followed by treatment with honokiol and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis as described [22]. Fixed and immunofluorescently stained cells were imaged by using a Zeiss LSM510 Meta (Zeiss) laser scanning confocal system configured to a Zeiss Axioplan 2 upright microscope with a 63XO (NA 1.4) plan-apochromat objective. All experiments were performed multiple times by using independent biologic replicates.Breast tumorigenesis assay MDA-MB-231 (5 × 106) cells in 0.1 ml of HBSS were injected subcutaneously into the right gluteal region of 4- to 6-week-old female athymic nude mice. Two weeks after initial implantation, the animals were placed into two experimental groups. Mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of (a) control (saline and Intralipidor (b) honokiol, at 3 mg/mouse/day in 20% Intralipid (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, USA), 3 times per week for the duration of the experiment. Tumors were measured by using vernier calipers, with tumor volume calculated by using the formula (V = a/2 × b2), where V is the tumor volume in cubic millimeters, and a and b are the largest and smallest diameters in millimeters, respectively. All animals were killed after 4 weeks of treatment. Tumors were collected; weighed, fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin; and subjected to further analysis with immunohistochemistry.Immunohistochemical analysis We used tumor sections to determine the effect of honokiol on expression of p-AMPK, LKB1, and Ki-67 by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed essentially as described by us previously for other proteins [25,26]. At least four nonoverlapping representative images from each tumor section from five mice of each group were captured by using ImagePro software for quantitation of p-AMPK, LKB1, and Ki-67 expression. Total cell lysates were prepared from tumor samples and subjected to immunoblot analysis. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of University ACUC.Statistical analysis All experiments were performed thrice in triplicates. Statistical analysis was performed by using Microsoft Excel software. Significant differences were analyzed by using the Student t test and two-tailed distribution. Data were considered to be statistically significant if P < 0.05. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM between triplicate experiments performed thrice.ResultsHonokiol treatment inhibits clonogenicity, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells Growth-inhibition and apoptosis-induction properties of honokiol have been reported in several cancer cell lines [3,9-12,18]. In the current study, two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, were treated with various concentrations ranging from 1 μM to 25 μM honokiol and subjected to clonogenicity (Figure 1a) and anchorage-independent growth assay (Figure 1b). Dose-dependent and statistically significant inhibition of clonogenicity and soft-agar colony formation was observed in the presence of honokiol. Treatment with 5 μM honokiol resulted in ~50% to 60% inhibition in clonogenicity and soft-agar colony formation, whereas higher concentrations (10 and 25 μM) were more inhibitory (Figure 1a, b). We further examined the effect of honokiol on the growth of HCC1806 breast cancer cells, which harbor an LKB1 homozygous mutation, by using clonogenicity and soft-agar colony formation assay. Our studies show that honokiol does not inhibit the growth of HCC-1806 cells (Additional file 1). These results indicate that LKB1 might be an integral molecule for honokiol-mediated growth inhibition.Figure 1 Honokiol inhibits clonogenicity and anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells. (a) MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with various concentrations of honokiol (HNK) (as indicated) and subjected to clonogenicity assay. U, untreated cells. Colonies containing > 50 normal-appearing cells were counted. *P < 0.005, compared with untreated controls. (b) Breast cancer cells were subjected to soft-agar colony-formation assay in the presence of various concentrations of honokiol for 3 weeks. Results are expressed as average number of colonies counted (in six microfields). *P < 0.001, compared with untreated controls. Cancer progression is a multistep process that involves invasion of basement membrane by tumor cells and migration to points far from a given primary tumor mass, leading to metastasis [29]. We examined the effect of honokiol on breast cancer cell migration and invasion by using scratch migration, electric-cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)-based migration, spheroid migration, and Matrigel invasion assays. Honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition of migration of breast cancer cells (Figure 2a) in comparison with untreated cells. For quantitative determination of alteration in the migration potential of breast cancer cells on treatment with honokiol, we performed a quantitative real-time impedance assay by using an ECIS-based technique. As expected, confluent cells showed high resistance values. Confluent cells were subjected to a high-voltage pulse that resulted in decrease in resistance, indicating death and detachment of cells present on the small active electrode. Cells were left untreated or treated with honokiol, and changes in resistance were recorded for 24 hours. Control untreated cells showed an increase in resistance, showing increased migration of cells surrounding the small active electrode that were not submitted to the elevated voltage pulse to reach the resistance values of the nonwounded cells at the start of the experiment. Honokiol-treated cells showed a decrease in resistance, indicating decreased migration. Notably, honokiol-treated cells never reached the values of nonwounded cells, showing significant inhibition of migration potential (Additional file 2). We examined the effect of honokiol treatment on the migratory capacity of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells spheroids. Significant migration of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells from the spheroids was seen under untreated conditions. Honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition of migration of cells from spheroids (Figure 2b). Next, we performed Matrigel invasion assay to examine the effect of honokiol on the invasion potential of breast carcinoma cells. As evident from Figure 2c, honokiol treatment decreased invasion of breast cancer cells through Matrigel in comparison with untreated cells. Activation of FAK has been shown to regulate cancer cell migration and invasion through distinct pathways by promoting the dynamic regulation of focal adhesion and peripheral actin structures [30-32] and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-mediated matrix degradation [33]. We examined whether honokiol treatment affects FAK activation to inhibit migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Honokiol treatment inhibited FAK phosphorylation in breast cancer cells, indicating the involvement of FAK activation in honokiol-mediated inhibition of migration and invasion potential of breast cancer cells (Figure 2d). Collectively, these results show that honokiol treatment can effectively inhibit clonogenicity, anchorage-independent colony formation, migration, and invasion of breast carcinoma cells.Figure 2 Honokiol inhibits migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. (a) MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were subjected to scratch-migration assay. Culture media were replaced with media containing honokiol (2.5 μM) or untreated media (U). The 100-ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment was used as positive control. The plates were photographed at the identical location of the initial image (0 hours) at 24 hours. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. The histogram shows the fold change in migration. *P < 0.01, compared with untreated controls. (b) MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were subjected to spheroid-migration assay. Culture media were replaced with media containing honokiol (2.5 μM) or untreated media (U). The spheroids were photographed 48 hours after treatment. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. The histograms show percentage migration. *P < 0.01, compared with untreated controls. (c) MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Matrigel invasion chambers followed by treatment with honokiol (HNK, 1.0, 2.5 μM) for 24 hours, as indicated. U, untreated controls. The number of cells that invaded through the Matrigel was counted in five different regions. The slides were blinded to remove counting bias. The histograms show the mean of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. *P < 0.005, compared with untreated controls. (d) Breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were treated with honokiol (HNK, 2.5 μM) for indicated time intervals. U, untreated cells. Total protein was isolated, and equal amounts of proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis by using specific antibodies for phosphorylated FAK. The membranes were reblotted by using total FAK antibodies as controls. The blots are representative of multiple independent experiments.Honokiol-induced AMPK activation plays an integral role in honokiol-mediated inhibition of mTOR activity and migration potential of cells Honokiol modulates multiple pathways (nuclear factor (NF)-κB, ERK, Akt, and JNK) in a cellular process and target-tissue-dependent manner [7,9-11,19]. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a master sensor of cellular energy balance in mammalian cells by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism [34]. Recent studies have implicated AMPK as an important factor in cancer cell growth and migration [35,36]. Thus, we sought to determine the effect of honokiol on AMPK phosphorylation and activation. Honokiol treatment stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172 in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Honokiol had no effect on total AMPK protein expression levels (Figure 3a). AMPK phosphorylation at Thr-172 has been widely associated with its activation [37]. Once activated, AMPK directly phosphorylates and inactivates a number of ATP-consuming metabolic enzymes including acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) [38]. We examined the phosphorylation of ACC to evaluate AMPK activity with honokiol treatment. Increased phosphorylation of ACC in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was observed in response to honokiol treatment as compared with untreated cells, whereas total ACC protein levels remain unchanged (Figure 3a). Activation of AMPK leads to suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and the molecular mechanisms involve phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex protein TSC2 at Thr-1227 and Ser-1345 that increases the activity of the TSC1-TSC2 complex to inhibit mTOR [37,39]. Two very well characterized and widely studied downstream effectors of mTOR are the p70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1 or pS6K) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (elF4E)-binding protein (4EBP1) [40]. Phosphorylation of pS6K and 4EBP1 has been widely used to assess changes in mTOR activity in response to various growth-factor pathways. We next examined the effect of honokiol on mTOR activity in breast cancer cells. Honokiol decreased phosphorylation of pS6K and 4EBP1 in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells while not affecting the total protein levels of pS6K and 4EBP1 (Figure 3b). Recent studies have shown that pS6K regulates the actin cytoskeleton by acting as an actin filament cross-linking protein and as a Rho family GTPase-activating protein [41]. It has been shown that reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is critical for cell migration, as motile cancer cells must assemble and disassemble the actin filaments at their leading edges [42]. Depletion or inhibition of the activity of pS6K results in inhibition of actin cytoskeleton reorganization and inhibition of migration [41]. Owing to the integral role of pS6K in cancer cell migration, it is possible that honokiol-mediated inhibition of migration is mediated through pS6K inhibition.Figure 3 Honokiol activates AMPK and inhibits pS6K and 4EBP1 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells. (a) MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with honokiol (HNK, 2.5 μM) for indicated time intervals. U, untreated cells. Total protein was isolated, and equal amounts of proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis by using specific antibodies for phosphorylated AMPK (pAMPK-Thr 172) and phosphorylated ACC (pACC). The membranes were reblotted by using total AMPK and ACC antibodies as controls. The blots are representative of multiple independent experiments. The histogram is the mean of densitometric analysis showing relative density units (RDUs) of the Western blot signal for pAMPK and pACC normalized to total AMPK or ACC in three separate experiments. *P < 0.005, compared with untreated controls. (b) Breast cancer cells were treated with honokiol as in (a) and subjected to immunoblot analysis by using specific antibodies for phosphorylated pS6K (p-pS6K) and phosphorylated 4EBP1 (p-4EBP1). The membranes were reblotted by using total pS6K and p-4EBP1 antibodies as controls. The blots are representative of multiple independent experiments. The histogram is the mean of densitometric analysis showing relative density units (RDUs) of the Western blot signal for p-pS6K and p-4EBP1 normalized to total pS6K or 4EBP1 in three separate experiments. *P < 0.001, compared with untreated controls. mTOR, a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation, exists in two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is known to activate protein synthesis and cell growth through regulating pS6K and 4E-BP1 activity, whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt on Ser-473, activating cell growth, proliferation, and survival [43,44]. We found that honokiol increases AMPK activation and inhibits mTORC1 function, as evidenced by inhibition of pS6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. We next determined whether honokiol treatment modulates mTORC2 function. mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt on Ser-473. Therefore, to determine whether mTORC2 is also inhibited by honokiol under similar conditions, breast cancer cells were treated with honokiol, and the phosphorylation of Akt was determined. Honokiol did not alter Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473 in breast cancer cells (Additional file 3). These results provide evidence that honokiol only inhibits mTORC1 in breast cancer cells. Contrasting findings have been reported previously, showing reduction in Akt phosphorylation in response to honokiol treatment. Of note, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with much higher concentrations of honokiol (60, 80, and 100 μM) in this study [45]. Hence, the observed decrease in Akt phosphorylation may be due to the treatment with higher concentrations of honokiol. Honokiol inhibits breast cancer growth in a concentration-dependent manner, with higher concentrations much more inhibitory than lower concentrations (Figure 1). Although our findings clearly showed the involvement of AMPK activation in the honokiol signaling network, we raised the question whether honokiol-induced inhibition of mTOR and cell migration requires AMPK protein. We used MEFs derived from AMPK-WT (WT) and AMPK knockout (AMPK-null) mice to test the potential requirement of this protein in honokiol-mediated inhibition of migration. Immunoblotting confirmed the absence of the AMPK protein in AMPK-null MEFs (Figure 4a). In agreement with the absence of AMPK protein, the AMPK-null MEFs did not show any phosphorylation of ACC, even in the presence of honokiol. AMPK-WT MEFs, conversely, exhibited honokiol-stimulated phosphorylation of ACC, indicating activation of AMPK (Figure 4b). Exposure of MEFs derived from AMPK-WT mice to honokiol resulted in inhibition of phosphorylation of pS6K, whereas the MEFs derived from the AMPK-null mice were significantly resistant to the honokiol-mediated inhibition of pS6K phosphorylation (Figure 4d).Figure 4 AMPK knockdown abrogates honokiol-mediated increased phosphorylation of ACC, inhibition of phosphorylation of S6K, and inhibition of migration. (a) Immunoblotting for AMPK protein by using lysates from untreated MEFs derived from AMPK-WT (WT) and AMPK-knockout mice (AMPK-null). The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-actin antibody. (b) WT and AMPK-null MEFs were treated with honokiol (HNK, 2.5 μM) for indicated time intervals. U, untreated cell. Total protein was isolated, and equal amounts of proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis by using specific antibodies for phosphorylated ACC (p-ACC). Anti-actin antibody was used as control. (c) WT and AMPK-null MEFs were subjected to scratch-migration assay in the presence (HNK, 2.5 μM) or absence (U) of honokiol. The plates were photographed at the identical location of the initial image (0 hours) at 24 hours. The histogram shows the fold change in migration. *P < 0.001, compared with untreated controls. All the experiments were performed thrice in triplicate. (d) WT and AMPK-null MEFs were treated with honokiol (HNK, 2.5 μM) for indicated time intervals. U, untreated cell. Total protein was isolated, and equal amounts of proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis by using specific antibodies for phosphorylated pS6K (p-pS6K). The membranes were reblotted by using total pS6K and actin antibody as control. (e) WT and AMPK-null MEFs were subjected to XTT assay in the presence (HNK) or absence (U) of honokiol, as indicated. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. *P < 0.001, compared with untreated controls. We next asked whether AMPK is directly involved in honokiol-mediated inhibition of migration. AMPK-WT MEFs exhibited inhibition of migration in response to honokiol treatment in scratch migration as well as ECIS-based migration assay. Interestingly, honokiol treatment could not inhibit migration of AMPK-null MEFs (Figure 4c; Additional file 4). AMPK knockdown also inhibited the antiproliferative effect of honokiol (Figure 4e). These results showed that AMPK is an integral molecule in mediating the negative effects of honokiol on the mTOR axis and migration potential of cells.Inhibition of LKB1 abrogates honokiol-mediated modulation of AMPK and inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells The tumor suppressor LKB1 (also known as Stk11) is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that has a broad range of cellular functions, including tumor suppression, cell polarity, cell-cycle regulation, and promotion of apoptosis [46,47]. LKB1 has recently been identified as a critical upstream kinase for AMPK, regulating its activity. Intriguingly, we found that honokiol increases expression of tumor suppressor LKB1 in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, with a significant increase at 1 hour of treatment with maximal expression at 24 hours in MCF7 cells and at 4 hours in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5a). Variable expression of LKB1 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells has been reported [48,49]. We recently procured MDA-MB-231 cells from various established breast cancer research laboratories and analyzed the expression and functional status of LKB1. Our data unequivocally showed the presence of functional LKB1 in MDA-MB-231 cells [22]. Human LKB1 is both nuclear and cytoplasmic, but a mutant of LKB1 lacking the nuclear localization signal still retains the ability to suppress cell growth, suggesting that the cytosolic pool of LKB1 plays an important role in mediating its tumor-suppressor properties [50,51]. STRAD (Ste20-related adaptor) protein has been shown to form a complex in which STRAD activates LKB1, resulting in cytoplasmic translocation of LKB1 [47]. We investigated the effect of honokiol on the formation of the LKB1-STRAD complex in breast cancer cells. To address this question, breast cancer cells were treated with honokiol followed by immunoprecipitation with LKB1 antibodies. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were analyzed for the presence of STRAD by using Western blot analysis. Higher levels of STRAD immunoprecipitated with LKB1 in the presence of honokiol indicated increased formation of the LKB1-STRAD complex (Figure 5b). Immunostaining of honokiol-treated MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells revealed that honokiol treatment increases cytoplasmic accumulation of LKB1. LKB1 was localized predominantly in the nucleus in untreated breast cancer cells, although cytoplasmic LKB1 expression was also detected (Figure 5c). Control experiments with secondary antibody (results not shown) gave an extremely faint background staining that was distributed uniformly throughout the cells, irrespective of the treatment. Studies on the subcellular localization of LKB1 have indicated a wide variety of localization patterns. Mouse LKB1 was found to be predominantly nuclear, whereas Caenorhabditis elegans PAR-4 and Xenopus XEEK1 were detected exclusively in the cytoplasm [52-54]. Human LKB1 has been detected to be both nuclear and cytoplasmic in several cell types [55,56]. Although LKB1 expression is exclusively cytoplasmic in lung and pancreatic cancer [57,58], gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps from Peutz-Jeghers syndrome patients, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, invasive lobular breast carcinoma, and solid papillary ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer show both cytoplasmic and nuclear LKB1 expression [59-61]. Studies in adult rat primary cardiomyocytes and C2C12 myoblasts showed that LKB1 was located predominantly in nucleus and undergoes cytoplasmic localization in various stimulations [62-64]. In vitro studies suggest that nuclear LKB1 regulates cell-cycle progression and acts as a transcription factor [65,66], whereas cytoplasmic LKB1 participates in controlling energy metabolism and cell polarity [67]. It is not completely understood how subcellular localization of LKB1 affects its tumor-suppressor function and activation of other signaling pathways in vivo.Figure 5 Honokiol increases LKB1 expression, LKB1:STRAD interaction, cytosolic translocation, and depletion of LKB1 abrogates honokiol-mediated modulation of AMPK, inhibition of migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells. (a) MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 2.5 μM honokiol for indicated time intervals. U, untreated cell. Total protein was isolated, and equal amounts of proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis by using specific antibodies for LKB1. The membranes were reblotted by using actin antibody as control. The blots are representative of multiple independent experiments. The histogram is the mean of densitometric analysis showing relative density units (RDUs) of the Western blot signals for LKB1 normalized to actin in three independent experiments. *P < 0.005, compared with untreated controls. (b) MCF7 cells were treated with 2.5 μM honokiol or untreated and subjected to immunoprecipitation assay by using IgG or LKB1 antibodies, as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by using anti-STRAD antibodies. The histogram is the mean of densitometric analysis showing relative density units (RDUs) of the Western blot signals for STRAD in three independent experiments. *P < 0.005, compared with untreated controls. (c) MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with honokiol (HNK), and LKB1 protein was analyzed with immunofluorescence by using LKB1 antibody; 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining was used to determine the nuclear localization. These results are representative of multiple independent experiments. (d) LKB1 was depleted in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by using two different lentiviral LKB1 short-hairpin RNA (shRNA1 and shRNA2) constructs and a negative control construct that was created in the same vector system (pLKO.1). Stable pools of LKB1-depleted (LKB1shRNA) and vector control (pLKO.1) cells were used for total protein isolation, and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis by using specific antibodies for LKB1. Actin was used as control. (e) MDA-MB-231-LKB1shRNA (LKB1-sh1 and LKB1-sh2) and MDA-MB-231-pLKO.1 (pLKO.1) cells were treated with honokiol (HNK, 2.5 μM), and phosphorylation of AMPK was analyzed with Western blot analysis. Total AMPK antibody was used as control. (f) MDA-MB-231-LKB1shRNA (LKB1-sh1 and LKB1-sh2) and MDA-MB-231-pLKO.1 (pLKO.1) cells were grown to confluence, scratched with a pipette tip, and photographed immediately after scratching (0 hours). Culture media were replaced with media containing honokiol (HNK, 2.5 μM) or untreated media (U). The plates were photographed at the identical location of the initial image (0 hours) at 24 hours. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. (g) MDA-MB-231-LKB1shRNA (LKB1-sh1 and LKB1-sh2) and MDA-MB-231-pLKO.1 (pLKO.1) cells were cultured in Matrigel invasion chambers followed by treatment with honokiol (HNK, 2.5 μM) for 24 hours. The number of cells that invaded through the Matrigel was counted in five different regions. The slides were blinded to remove counting bias. The result shows the mean of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. *P < 0.005, compared with untreated controls. We raised the question whether LKB1 plays an important regulatory role in honokiol- mediated modulation of AMPK and inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. To address these questions, we used LKB1shRNA lentivirus and puromycin to select for stable pools of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with LKB1 depletion. We analyzed pLKO.1 and LKB1shRNA stable MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell pools for LKB1 protein expression with immunoblot analysis and found that LKB1 protein expression was significantly reduced in LKB1shRNA cells (shRNA1 and shRNA2) as compared with pLKO.1 control cells (Figure 5d). pLKO.1 and LKB1shRNA cells were treated with honokiol, and phosphorylation of AMPK was determined by using Western blot analysis. We found that honokiol increased phosphorylation of AMPK in pLKO.1 cells. Intriguingly, displaying a crucial role of LKB1, honokiol treatment did not change the phosphorylation levels of AMPK in LKB1shRNA cells (Figure 5e). Invasion and migration are the key biologic features of malignant behavior of carcinoma cells [29]. In addition to examining the effect of LKB1 depletion on honokiol-induced modulation of AMPK, we also examined the requirement of LKB1 in honokiol-mediated inhibition of metastatic properties of breast cancer cells. As evident from Figure 5f, honokiol treatment efficiently inhibited migration of pLKO.1 cells, whereas untreated pLKO.1 cells showed increased migration. Our results showed that LKB1shRNA cells exhibited increased migration in the absence of honokiol treatment. Interestingly, honokiol treatment did not inhibit the migration of LKB1shRNA cells (Figure 5f). We next examined the effect of honokiol on invasion potential of pLKO.1 and LKB1shRNA cells and found that honokiol inhibited invasion of pLKO.1 cells, whereas LKB1shRNA cells were not affected by honokiol treatment (Figure 5g). These results collectively show that honokiol-induced LKB1 overexpression is indeed a crucial component of the signaling machinery used by honokiol in modulating the AMPK-S6K axis and inhibiting the metastatic properties of breast cancer cells.Honokiol treatment inhibits breast-tumor progression in athymic nude mice We investigated the physiological relevance of our in vitro findings by evaluating whether honokiol has any suppressive effects on the development of breast carcinoma in nude mouse models and the involvement of the LKB1-AMPK axis. In the experimental group treated with honokiol, the rate of tumor growth was significantly inhibited, and the tumor size and weight were significantly reduced compared with control group (Figure 6a, b). The immunohistochemical assessment of tumor proliferation showed higher Ki-67 in the control group as compared with the honokiol-treated group (Figure 6c). In our in vitro analyses, we discovered the involvement and requirement of the LKB1-AMPK axis in biologic functions of honokiol. We examined the expression of LKB1 and p-AMPK in tumors treated with honokiol. Tumors treated with honokiol displayed higher levels of phosphorylated AMPK and LKB1 (Figure 6c). In addition, we examined the expression levels of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated AMPK, ACC as well as S6K, in honokiol-treated and vehicle-treated mice. We found higher levels of phosphorylated AMPK and ACC in honokiol-treated tumors as compared with vehicle-treated controls. Honokiol-treated tumors showed lower levels of phosphorylated S6K, whereas vehicle-treated controls exhibited high levels of phosphorylated S6K (Figure 6d). These data presented direct in vivo evidence of the involvement of LKB1-AMPK activation and the subsequent inhibition of pS6K in honokiol function (Figure 6e).Figure 6 Honokiol treatment inhibited breast tumor growth in nude mice. MDA-MB-231 cells-derived tumors were developed in nude mice and treated with vehicle or honokiol (HNK). (a) Tumor growth was monitored by measuring the tumor volume for 4 weeks (eight mice per group). (b) At the end of 6 weeks, tumors were collected, measured, weighed, and photographed. Honokiol treatment inhibited tumor size as compare with vehicle treatment. Average tumor weight and representative tumor images are shown here. (c) Tumor samples were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis by using LKB1, p-AMPK, and Ki67 antibodies. Honokiol (HNK) treatment decreased the expression of Ki-67, increased expression of LKB1 and pAMPK, as compared with vehicle treatment. Bar diagrams show quantitation of protein expression in tumors from vehicle- and honokiol-treated mice. Columns, mean (n = 8); bar, SD. *Significantly different (P < 0.005) compared with control. (d) Tumor lysates (from two different tumors from each set) were subjected to immunoblot analysis by using phospho-AMPK (p-AMPK), AMPK, phospho-ACC (p-ACC), ACC, phospho-pS6K, pS6K antibodies. Actin antibody was used as control. (e) A model of honokiol (HNK)-stimulated AMPK activation in breast cancer cells. Honokiol stimulation induces LKB1 translocation from the nucleus into cytosol and phosphorylates AMPK, leading to increased phosphorylation of ACC and decreased phosphorylation of pS6K and 4EBP1.Discussion The antitumor activity of honokiol, a natural product derived from magnolia plant and used in traditional Asian medicine, has been reported in various preclinical models [3]. In the current study, we investigated the potential of honokiol in the inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The following novel findings are reported in this study: (i) honokiol treatment inhibits malignant properties such as invasion and migration of breast cancer cells; (ii) honokiol stimulates AMPK phosphorylation and activity while reducing mTOR activity, as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of pS6K and 4EBP1; (iii) AMPK protein is required for honokiol-mediated inhibition of pS6K and 4EBP1; (iv) honokiol increases the expression and cytosolic localization of tumor suppressor LKB1, which is an essential effector molecule to mediate the honokiol effect on the AMPK-pS6K axis and inhibition of invasion and migration of breast cancer cells; and (v) honokiol inhibits breast tumor growth and modulates the LKB1-AMPK-pS6K axis in vivo. Our results show that honokiol treatment significantly inhibits malignant properties of breast cancer cells through modulation of the LKB1-AMPK-pS6K axis; thus using honokiol may be a suitable therapeutic strategy for metastatic breast cancer. Many bioactive molecules and their synthetic analogues have been reported to demonstrate activity against breast cancer [68-71]. Although the lower toxicity associated with bioactive molecules is a much desired quality, their limited bioavailability hinders further development. Honokiol exhibits a desirable spectrum of bioavailability, in contrast with many other natural products [3]. The development of other polyphenolic agents has been obstructed by poor absorption and rapid excretion [72]. Honokiol does not have this disability, as significant systemic levels of honokiol can be obtained in preclinical models, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier [73]. These qualities of honokiol make it a promising small-molecular-weight natural anticancer agent. Indeed, honokiol has been found to alter many molecular targets in various cancer models to inhibit tumor cell growth and survival [3,6,9,10,12,19]. One of the major findings of this study is that the LKB1-AMPK pathway plays a major role in mediating the effect of honokiol effect on migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. AMPK, a master sensor of cellular energy balance in mammalian cells, regulates glucose and lipid metabolism [34]. Biochemical regulation of serine/threonine protein kinase AMPK activation occurs through multiple mechanisms [37]. AMPK undergoes a conformational change in response to direct binding of AMP to its nucleotide-binding domain, exposing the activation loop of the catalytic kinase subunit. LKB1 phosphorylates a critical threonine in this activation loop to activate AMPK. Dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases also plays an important role in regulating AMPK activity [47]. Genetic depletion of LKB1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) results in a loss of AMPK activation after energy stresses that increase AMP [37], showing the requirement of LKB1 in AMPK activation. We found that honokiol increases AMPK activation, which can be efficiently inhibited by the silencing of LKB1. AMPK represents a pivotal point in the mTOR pathway regulating a vast range of cellular activities, including transcription, translation, cell size, mRNA turnover, protein stability, ribosomal biogenesis, and cytoskeletal organization [37]. Besides being directly activated by tumor-suppressor LKB1, AMPK itself regulates the activation of two other tumor suppressors, TSC1 and TSC2, which are critical regulators of Rheb and mTOR [37]. We found that AMPK knockdown inhibits honokiol-mediated mTOR inhibition. Honokiol-mediated inhibition of mTOR also suggests that honokiol and its derivatives may prove excellent candidates as targeted therapies for carcinomas characterized by hyperactive mTOR signaling. LKB1 kinase is a tumor suppressor and a key determinant in the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an inherited susceptibility to gastrointestinal, lung, pancreatic, and breast cancer [47,74]. Inactivation of the LKB1 gene has been shown in a subset of sporadic lung and pancreatic cancer. Although the loss of LKB1 expression is not commonly observed in human breast carcinoma, it certainly correlates with high-grade DCIS and high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma [61]. It is important to note that LKB1 expression was not abrogated in pure DCIS cases but only in the DCIS associated with invasion, indicating that loss of LKB1 could potentially promote invasion. Supporting this notion, low LKB1 protein levels have been reported to correlate with poor prognosis in breast carcinoma [48]. Our studies show that honokiol treatment increases the expression and cytosolic localization of LKB1 in breast xenograft tumors and inhibits tumor growth. LKB1 is localized predominantly in the nucleus, translocating to the cytosol, either by forming a heterotrimeric complex with STRAD (ste20-related adaptor protein) and MO25 (mouse protein 25) or by associating with LIP1 (LKB1-interacting protein), to exert its biologic functions [50,52,55,75,76]. The cytoplasmic pool of LKB1 plays an important role in mediating its tumor-suppressor properties. Wild-type LKB1, when co-expressed with STRAD and MO25, exhibits increased cytoplasmic localization, whereas mutant LKB1, unable to interact with STRAD and MO25, remains in the nucleus [75,77]. Promotion of cytosolic translocation of LKB1 is a common mechanism to activate downstream LKB1 functions, as AMPK activation by metformin, peroxynitrile, or adiponectin also involves LKB1 cytosolic translocation [22,64,78-80]. Honokiol treatment increases LKB1-STRAD complex formation in addition to overexpression of LKB1, thus increasing the functional pool of LKB1. Our study shows for the first time that honokiol stimulates the cytosolic translocation of LKB1 in breast cancer cells.Conclusions We uncovered a novel mechanism by which honokiol inhibits invasion and migration of breast cancer cells, which involves enhanced expression and cytosolic localization of LKB1 and AMPK activation. We also demonstrated the requirement of LKB1 and AMPK in honokiol-mediated inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Our results thus provide new insight into the mechanisms by which honokiol, a promising anticancer agent, inhibits breast carcinogenesis.Abbreviations 4EBP1: 4E binding protein 1; ACC: acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ECIS: electric cell-substrate impedance sensing; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; LKB1: liver kinase B1; MEFs: mouse embryonic fibroblasts; pS6K: p70S6kinase; WT: wild type.Conflicting interests AN, MYB, NKS, and DS declare no conflict of interest.

Introduction Phthalate ester derivatives have been used as plasticizers in a wide variety of plastic products, such as children’s toys, medical devices and various types of packaging [1]. However, in some illegal food industry applications, phthalates have been used as a low-cost substitute to replace palm oil as a clouding agent added to juices, yogurt and beverages. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP; Figure 1) is one of the most popular phthalates used as clouding agent in beverages, which has been detected by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration in 2011 [2]. Previous research has demonstrated that DBP is a developmental and reproductive toxicant that can reduce the binding of estrogen to estrogen receptors and inhibit estrogen’s transcriptional activity [3]. Toxicity studies have investigated the developmental toxicity of DBP in rodents. Dobrzynska et al., (2011) indicated that paternal DBP exposure may disturb offspring, including delay of female sexual maturation, deterioration of the quality of sperm [4] and malformation of the anorectum in males [5]. In addition, oral DBP administration appears to affect the second generation more than the first generation in rats [6]. Concerning potential testicular toxicity of DBP in rodents, previous reports have indicated that exposure to DBP results in significantly lower testicular weight [7], reduced anogenital distance [8], spermatogenesis dysfunction [9] and cryptorchidism [10] in male rats. Although considerable research attention has been given to male reproductive toxicity of DBP in rodents, most other studies focus on the pharmacokinetics of DBP in pregnant rats and their offspring [11–13]. Recently, phthalates have been found to be prevalent in various environments, including food, air, soil and even in pharmaceutical products and medical devices [14]. From all these sources, the chemical is taken up into humans and animals primarily via chronic absorption by ingestion, inhalation or dermal absorption and by acute intake via injection of pharmaceutical products or medical devices. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of plasticizer absorbed by acute and chronic methods must be assessed. To measure the phthalates, several quantitative methods have been developed, including high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) [15], gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) [16], gas chromatography employing an electron capture detector (GC-ECD) [17] and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [18]. High-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) has been used for the quantitative analysis of 13C4-labeled phthalates and their metabolites in bio-samples [1,19]. However, this method may be time-consuming and complicated in the pre-treatment for analysis of 13C4-labeled phthalates and their metabolites. Nowadays, LC-MS/MS is the main trend for bioanalysis. To compromise the advantages of the isotope-labeled analysis, the detailed and completed method validation should be performed according to US FDA guidelines [20]. The novelty of this article is to develop a freely moving rat model coupled to LC-MS/MS to investigate the pharmacokinetics of DBP with oral and intravenous administration in rats. To investigate the oral absorption and fecal excretion of DBP, the aim of this study is to optimize a sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to measure DBP in rat plasma and feces in free moving male rats. This method is then applied to the pharmacokinetics of DBP and its unabsorbed fecal elimination.2. Results and Discussion2.1. LC–MS/MS and Method Validation In order to improve the detection of DBP, the UPLC–MS/MS condition has been optimized and validated by the following steps. First, an intellstarte (Waters Acquity UPLC™ system built-in software) was used to optimize the mass condition for DBP and the internal standard. Two types of mobile phase, 0.1% formic acid-methanol and ammonium acetate (5 mM)-methanol, were used to adjust the analytes’ signal strength to an acceptable mass spectrometer condition. Secondly, since the mass condition was performed in positive ionization mode, the aqueous phase with ammonium acetate (5 mM) was selected. For the organic phase, acetonitrile and methanol have both been tested. A gradient elution consisted with a mobile phase from ammonium acetate (5 mM)-methanol (10:90, v/v) to ammonium acetate (5 mM)-methanol (30:70, v/v) was adjusted at a flow-rate of 0.25 mL/min. Based on the results from the above tests, the optimized mobile phase decided for the optimal LC condition consisted of ammonium acetate (5 mM)-methanol (27:73, v/v) at a flow-rate of 0.25 mL/min. Thirdly, several methods for sample preparation, such as protein precipitation and liquid–liquid extraction, have been examined. However, background interference was presented in the blank plasma extract by liquid-liquid extraction, but did not appear in the process of protein precipitation. In the universal background presence of various plasticizers in the general environment, however, the contamination level can be reduced by careful selection of analytical tools, glassware, solvents and frequent verification of the chromatographic system [21]. The process of liquid-liquid extraction was more complicated than protein precipitation, and we also found that the blank plasma extract was present from the background interference by liquid-liquid extraction. Therefore, we simplified the sample preparation procedure by using protein precipitation with methanol to avoid any possibility of DBP contamination. The potential hydrolyze enzymes were also removed by protein precipitation. The ex vivo study of the hydrolytic activity was dependent on the protein concentration in the supernatant, optimum temperature and pH of the hydrolysis, which was 50 °C and 8.2, respectively [22], and the enzymatic kinetics were allowed to establish a reaction time of 30 min [23]. Also, the protein precipitation didn’t take a long time, and the mixture was centrifuged and kept at 4 °C. Figures 2A and 3A show chromatograms of blank samples (plasma, feces) after protein precipatation, illustrating the baseline without any disturbing peaks in the chromatograms of real samples. No interference or other metabolites were co-eluted with DBP. Figure 2B shows a chromatogram of a plasma sample spike with DBP (1 μg/mL) and chrysin (1 μg/mL), and Figure 2C shows the real blood samples after DBP administration (30 mg/kg, i.v.) with chrysin (1 μg/mL). For fecal analysis, Figure 3B shows the chromatogram of fecal sample spiked with DBP (1 μg/g) and chrysin (1 μg/mL), and Figure 3C shows the actual fecal sample collected from rat feces (0–12 h) after DBP administration (100 mg/kg, p.o.) with chrysin (1 μg/mL). To assess the analytical range of the developed method, various concentrations of DBP in blank samples (plasma, feces) ranging from 0.05 to 2.5 μg/mL and 0.125 to 2.5 μg/g were tested. The results showed a good correlation coefficient (r2 ≥ 0.995) for DBP over the concentration range from separately prepared analytical runs on different days. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, five replications of each freshly prepared calibration standards were used for the determination of intra-day and inter-day accuracy (Bias%) and precision (R.S.D.%). The inter- and intra-day precision and accuracy values for blood and feces are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. For DBP in rat plasma, the inter-day precisions (R.S.D.%) ranged from 0.02% to 15.97%, while accuracy (Bias%) was between (–7.27%) and 6.07%. Intra-day precision (R.S.D.%) ranged from 0.07% to 15.27%, and accuracy (Bias%) was between (−7.16%) and 10.15%. Likewise, the inter-day precisions (R.S.D.%) ranged from 1.05% to 11.86%, and accuracy (Bias%) were (−3.71%) to 11.93% for DBP in rat feces. On the other hand, intra-day precision (R.S.D.%) ranged from 0.82% to 17.50%, and accuracy (Bias%) was (−6.43%) to 14.23%. The inter- and intra-day accuracy and precision showed repeatability and reliability. The calibration curves of DBP in plasma and feces samples were acceptable for quantification, and the analytical method could be applied to pharmacokinetic studies. The data demonstrated that the LOQ of DBP in plasma samples and fecal samples was 0.05 μg/mL and 0.125 μg/g, respectively. Analyte matrix effect and recovery were used to evaluate different sample preparations, while the post-column infusion method and the post-extraction spike method were used to evaluate matrix effects. In this study, the post-extraction spike method was selected to evaluate the matrix effect of DBP in biosamples (plasma, feces). This method quantitatively evaluates matrix effects by contrasting the response of an analyte in standard solution to the response of the analyte spiked into a blank matrix sample that has been passed through the sample preparation process [24]. The data demonstrated that the matrix effect of DBP in rat plasma and feces were 98.50 ± 0.54 and 100.63% ± 0.08%, respectively (Table 3). The extraction recovery of DBP in rat plasma and feces were 99.02 ± 2.22 and 99.4% ± 0.77%, respectively (Table 3). In addition, chrysin had a high matrix effect and recovery in rat plasma and feces after protein precipitation, though it was observed that chrysin did not interfere with the matrix effect and recovery of DBP in rat plasma and feces (Table 3). As a result, it was accepted as the internal standard for this study. The results showed that this analytical method was acceptable for use in the pharmacokinetic study of DBP in freely moving adult male rats.2.2. Pharmacokinetics Study of DBP The pharmacokinetic models (one- versus two-compartment) were compared according to the AIC [25], with minimum AIC values being regarded as the best representation of the blood concentration-time course data. A compartmental model with individual animal data after dose was proposed by the computer program WinNonlin. This AIC value on average decreases from (−23.57) ± 3.66 for one-compartment model to (−37.09) for the two-compartment model, indicating that the two-compartment model is more suitable than the one-compartment model for the DBP administration (30 mg/kg, i.v.; Figure 4; Table 4). The following equation applies to a two-compartmental pharmacokinetic model: C = Ae−αt + Be−βt. In the equation, A and B are the concentration (C) intercepts for fast and slow disposition phases, respectively; α and β are the disposition rate constants for fast and disposition phases, respectively. Analysis of the data after DBP administration (30 mg/kg, i.v.) yields the pharmacokinetic equation of C = 6.04e−0.15t + 0.18e−0.02t. The present study first uses a freely moving rat model to investigate the pharmacokinetics of DBP with oral and intravenous administration to rats. The pharmacokinetic curve showed that the mean plasma concentration was rapidly distributed during the first 60 min and then trends toward slow excretion after DBP administration (30 mg/kg, i.v.; Figure 4). The pharmacokinetic data indicated that DBP achieved an AUC of 57.8 ± 5.93 min μg/mL, a clearance of 551 ± 64 mL/min/kg and a mean residence time of 123 ± 78 min. The distribution and elimination half-life were 5.77 ± 1.14 and 217 ± 131 min, respectively, showing DBP rapid distribution and slow elimination after DBP administration (30 mg/kg, i.v.; Table 4). However, we could not detect DBP in plasma up to six hours after a single oral dose was administered (100 mg/kg, p.o.), indicating that DBP was metabolized rapidly through the gastrointestinal tract in rats, and only 0.18% of the administered dose was recovered from the feces within 48 h (Figure 5). The hypothesis for the disposition of phthalates in the body may proceed through the following three major steps. In the first step, the phthalate diesters will be cleaved into the individual hydrolytic monoesters. In the second step, the alkyl chain of the resulting hydrolytic monoester can be modified by various oxidation reactions. In the final step, both the hydrolytic monoester and the oxidized secondary metabolites can be conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in urine [2,14]. Our result is consistent with the above hypothesis that DBP was rapidly distributed with a distribution half-life of 5.77 ± 1.14 min after DBP administration (30 mg/kg, i.v.) and undetectable in the plasma and low cumulative fecal excretion after oral administration (100 mg/kg, p.o.). Due to the illegal use of DBP (one of the plasticizers) in the food industry, detailed toxicokinetic information may not be sufficient. We have surveyed from the previous literature focusing on the dose selection of oral and IV administration [12,26]. However, the correlation between drug concentrations and enzymes were still insufficient. The DBP exposure levels of the pharmacokinetic parameters, with the rate limited by the enzyme detoxification systems, were limited. For the low level of cumulative fecal excretion, the potential explanation is that the DBP may well be absorbed and quickly metabolized. Our results agree with a previous report that the fecal excretion is low and that more than 90% of the dose is excreted via metabolites in the urine within 48 h following either intravenous or oral administration [27]. For metabolism and elimination of DBP, previous studies have found that DBP is metabolized to its metabolite-monobutyl phthalate (MBP) through phase I biotransformation in the stomach and small intestine, and almost all enters the bloodstream as MBP [28]. Then, the phase II biotransformation of MBP is rapidly conjugated to its glucuronide conjugate (monobutyl phthalate glucuronide, MBP-G) within 5 min in maternal plasma [26].3. Experimental Section3.1. Chemicals DBP was purchased from Accu Standard (Unitech, New Haven, CT, USA). Sodium chloride (NaCl), heparin sodium and olive oil were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) was purchased from Fluka (St. Louis, MO, USA). Water for all preparations was prepared by the Milli-Q system (Millipore, Milford, MA, USA). Ammonium acetate and methanol of MS grade were purchased from E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).3.2. Animal Experiment Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 ± 20 g were obtained from the National Yang-Ming University Animal Center, Taipei, Taiwan. The rats were specifically pathogen-free and had free access to food (Laboratory Rodent Diet 5001, PMI Nutrition International LLC, St. Louis, MO, USA) and water. The rats were housed with a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. All experimental protocols involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC number: 1000902) of National Yang-Ming University. The rats were anesthetized by pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.), and polyethylene tubes were implanted in the right jugular and right femoral veins. The catheter was exteriorized, fixed in the dorsal neck region and capped with a stopper. For the oral administration group, only the right jugular was catheterized for blood sampling. The patency of the tubing was maintained by flushing with heparinized normal saline (0.9% NaCl, w/v, solution containing 20 IU/mL heparin sodium salt). While remaining anesthetized during a series of surgeries, each rat had its body temperature maintained at 37 °C with a heating pad. After surgery, the rat was placed in an experimental cage and allowed to recover for one day. During the recovery period, the rat was kept warm under a light.3.3. LC–MS/MS and Method Validation A Waters Acquity UPLC™ system coupled to a WatersXevo™ tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer fitted with electrospray ionization probe (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) was used in this study. The analytes were separated by an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) column (Waters Corporation), and the column temperature was maintained at 40 °C. The mobile phase was optimized as ammonium acetate (5 mM)-methanol (27:73, v/v) at a flow-rate of 0.25 mL/min. The positive ion mode with multiple reactions monitor (MRM) was used for UPLC-MS/MS analysis. The following precursor to product ion transitions were used: m/z 279.25→148.93 for DBP and m/z 255.09→102.96 for the chrysin (internal standard, IS) (Figure 1). The following parameters were optimized for DBP and chrysin analysis: capillary voltage of 3.11 kV, desolvation gas (nitrogen) heated to 400 °C and a desolvation gas flow rate of 800 L/h. The cone voltages were set to 22 V and 66 V, while the collision energy voltages were set to 14 eV and 32 eV for DBP and chrysin, respectively (Table 5). The MassLynx 4.1 software (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) was used for data processing. Pharmacokinetic studies for bioanalytical assays were based on the method validation according to the FDA guidelines [20], including tests of calibration curve, precision and accuracy. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was defined as the lowest concentration of the linear range, and the limit of detection (LOD) was defined as the concentration of analyte giving a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3. Quantitation of DBP in plasma and fecal fluid was based on calibration curves, ranging from 0.05 to 2.5 μg/mL and 0.125 to 2.5 μg/g with the correlation coefficient (r2) greater than 0.995, respectively. The matrix effect and recovery of DBP in rat plasma and fecal fluid were assessed at the concentrations of 0.125, 1.25 and 2.5 μg/mL (μg/g). The chrysin (IS) concentrations were 1 μg/mL in rat plasma and fecal fluid. Matrix effect (%) and recovery (%) were calculated using the formulas:(1)Matrix effect=(the peak areas for standards spiked after extraction/the peak areasobtained in neat solution standards)×100(2)Recovery=(the peak areas for standards spiked before  extraction/the peak areas forstandards spiked after extraction)×1003.4. Blood Sampling Collection DBP was dissolved in PEG 400 and olive oil for intravenous and oral administration, respectively. According to a study done by Brunner et al., dietary oils (corn oil, olive oil, sesame oil and soybean oil) intake may affect hepatic cytochrome P450 isoforms activity in rat [29]. However, there are no direct toxicity data between the corn oil and olive oil. Therefore, the olive oil was used as a vehicle for DBP oral administration [30]. For the intravenous group, DBP (30 mg/kg, n = 5) was given via the femoral vein catheter, whereas DBP (100 mg/kg, n = 6) was given via gastric gavage for the oral groups. An aliquot of 150 μL blood collected from the jugular vein catheter was withdrawn into a heparin-rinsed vial, and the lost blood was replaced with an equal volume (150 μL) of heparinized saline after each sampling. In the group with intravenous administration, blood samples were collected at 5, 15, 30 and 45 min and 1, 1.5 and 2 h after dosing. After the oral dose of 100 mg/kg, blood samples were collected at 15, 30 and 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 4 and 6 h after administration. Each blood sample was centrifuged at 6000× g for 10 min to acquire the plasma. The resulting plasma sample was stored at −20 °C before analysis.3.5. Fecal Excretion of DBP after a Single Oral Administration The fecal samples were collected separately at 12 h intervals for two consecutive days by a metabolic cage (Mini Mitter, Bend, OR, USA) after oral administration of DBP (100 mg/kg, n = 6). During this experiment, the rats also had free access to food and water in the animal facilities. The fecal sample was extracted with acetonitrile (1 g:4 mL, w/v) by homogenization for 1 min.3.6. Blood and Fecal Sample Preparation The protein precipitation method was used to remove macromolecules from plasma and fecal samples. An aliquot of 45 μL plasma and fecal sample or blank plasma and feces, 5 μL chrysin (IS) and 150 μL methanol were added and vortexed for 30 s. The mixture was centrifuged at 16,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C. Then, the supernatant was transferred to autosampler vials and 5 μL was injected into the UPLC system.3.7. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis and Statistics All pharmacokinetic analysis was processed by the WinNonlin Standard Edition Version 1.0 (Scientific Consulting Inc.: Apex, NC, USA). Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value was used to select the compartment model used for data analysis.4. Conclusions This study developed a sensitive and reliable analytical method to detect DBP in a freely moving rat model using a simple protein preparation detected by UPLC-MS/MS. The pharmacokinetic results revealed that DBP was best fitted by the two-compartment model in the rats. DBP was eliminated rapidly after intravenous and oral administration. The feces were a minor route of excretion of DBP in rats. These results provide very important information on the pharmacokinetics for further risk assessment for DBP.

The derangement of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions detected in chronic cholangiopathies is most probably the pro-fibrogenic mechanism in liver cirrhosis of fallow deer () infected with the giant liver fluke (). Myofibroblasts, especially hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), play an important role in the synthesis of extracellular matrix components in the development of parasitic fibrosis and cirrhosis in the liver of fallow deer. Background The giant liver fluke (Fascioloides magna) is a parasite which, contrary to other liver flukes of ruminants, exists as parasite in the hepatic parenchyma of domestic and wild ruminants, where it inflicts damage to all liver structures with the consequent development of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The giant liver fluke originates from North America, from where it spread to other regions through imports of deer game. It occurs sporadically in Central Europe, and its spreading to Serbia is probably connected with the course of the Danube River, as its flooding spreads the intermediate host, the dwarf pond snail Galba truncatula[1-5]. Through its penetration and spreading through the liver in the early stage of the disease, the giant liver fluke causes changes in the liver parenchyma that are characterized by findings of cystic spaces. These cystoid formations are filled with brown mucous fluid which contains parasites of oval leaf-like shape, around 50–70 × 30-40 mm in diameter and dark red in colour, without a cephalic cone, and with a clearly expressed mouth sucker. The thin-walled cystoid formations partly communicate with the bile pathways through which the liver fluke releases eggs which are disseminated into the outer environment by faeces. In addition to the presence of the liver fluke, there is also visible pigmentation in the form of black spots in the liver parenchyma, the portal lymph node, the peritoneum, diaphragm, and omentum [1]. The microscopic finding in the liver of infected deer includes the presence of large quantities of connective tissue that forms wider or narrower stripes that are wound around groups of degenerated and regenerated liver lobuli which are irregular in shape and of unequal size. Connective tissue septa are often seen to contain lymphocytes, macrophages which often contain brown pigment – parasite hematin, which is also present in the parenchyma. The bile duct walls are thickened, and desquamated cells, parasite eggs and brown pigment are present in their lumen [1,6-9]. These changes are somewhat similar to those described in the liver of domestic ruminants in connection with infection with the big liver fluke Fasciola hepatica. In chronic form, changes in infections with F. hepatica include stenosis of portal blood vessels, hyperplasia of blood vessels tunica media and a large number of newly-created blood vessels in the connective tissue stripes. Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis develop as the ultimate result of chronic liver damage caused by F. hepatica [10-13]. As it is known, hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis develop following chronic damage to parenchymatous cells caused by infective agents, toxins, drugs, chemicals, malnutrition, metabolites, and hypoxia [14-17]. During the process of fibrosis and cirrhosis development, the loss of hepatocytes leads to fibroblast proliferation and transdifferentiation [18-27]. Accordingly, myofibroblast-dependent progressive fibrogenesis is sustained by at least three main pro-fibrogenic mechanisms: 1) chronic activation of the wound healing response, 2) radical oxygen system and other oxidative stress-related reactive mediators, 3) dearangement of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction and epithelial-mesenchymal transition detected in chronic cholangiopathies [28,29]. Based on location and immunohistochemical profile three myofibroblasts (MF) subpopulations were described. These comprise 1) portal or septal MFs, present in the portal areas or in newly formed fibrous septa, 2) interface MFs, present at the interface between parenchyma and stroma of the portal areas or newly formed fibrous septa, and 3) the perisinusoidally located hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) [22,28]. All types have fibrogenic potential, but many investigators regard HSCs as the principal fibrocompetent cell in the liver. Depending on the primary site of injury the resulting fibrosis may be restricted to the portal areas, as in most biliary diseases, or may be present in the hepatic parenchyma as seen in chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Although incompletely understood, the activation or transdifferentiation of MFs is a key event in liver tissue repair. Activated HSC express α-SMA and desmin and in humans and rats are without doubt the most important cells that are involved in the creation of extracellular matrix which occurs within liver fibrosis [30-40]. The behaviour of hepatic MFs during the process of development of parasitic liver cirrhosis in connection with natural infection of fallow deer (Dama dama) with the giant liver fluke (Fascioloides magna) is not known. This fact was the reason why the distribution and localization of hepatic MFs have been described and their role discussed in this paper, in addition to the descriptions of histological characteristics of parasitic liver cirrhosis in fallow deer.Material and methodsAnimals Livers of 67 fallow deer of different sex and age have been analyzed in this paper. All the samples in this research were collected from animals that had been shot as part of a program to control the deer population. The material originated from deer shot within sanitary regulations and under veterinarian and biologist supervision in area of Northern Serbia closed to river Danube. The criteria for the selected deer were: poor condition of the animal, sluggish movement, poorly developed musculature, low representation of fatty tissue, poor hair cover and diarrhoea.Histopathology and immunohistochemistry analysis Liver samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and, after standard processing in an automated tissue processor, cast in paraffin blocks. Paraffin sections 3–5 μm thick were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with Masson’s trichrome for connective tissue for light microscopic examination. Primary antibodies α-SMA and desmin were chosen for the study of expression of activated HSC in three-step indirect immunohistochemical technique. After antigen retrieval and inactivation of endogenous peroxidase, sections were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies diluted in PBS. Primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry were Desmin D33 (DAKO, M0760) diluted 1/100 and α-SMA 1A4 (DAKO, M0851) diluted 1/50. All rinsing procedures and serum dilutions were done in PBS (pH 7.2). The detection kit was labeled streptavidin biotin (LSAB2) System-HRP, Rabbit/mouse (DAKO, K0675). Reactions were visualized by using 3,3-Diaminobenzidine (DAB+) (DAKO, K3468) and counterstaining with hematoxylin. Smooth muscle cells within the blood vessel wall were used as internal positive controls for α-SMA and desmin. Liver sections not treated with the primary antibody were used as negative controls.ResultsMacroscopic findings In 35 (52.24%) animals, macroscopic changes were observed in the liver. The livers were enlarged, dirty-grey in colour partialy with black pigment deposits, and with accumulated fibrin on the surface and cystoid formations on the cross-section. Texture was mostly rubbery and tough, except in places where cystoid expansions were observed (Figure 1). These cystoid formations were filled with a brown mucous liquid which contained parasites of oval, leaf-like shape, around 50-70 mm × 30-40 mm in diameter, dark red in colour, without a cephalic cone, and with a clearly expressed cephalic sucker. The identification of the giant liver fluke (Fascioloides magna) was confirmed also by parasitological analysis.Figure 1 Section of the deer liver, dirty-grey in colour, with accumulated fibrin on the surface and thick-wall cystoid formations on the cross-section and circumscribed deposits of black pigment.Histopathology The histopathological examination of the deer liver showed that the liver architecture was partly or completely disrupted with numerous pseudolobuli (Figure 2). Connective tissue fibres were present in the form of wide or narrow stripes and they divide the liver parenchyma into pseudolobuli of unequal size and irregular shape. In the multiplied connective tissue stripes, there were numerous blood vessels with thickened walls which contain smooth muscle cells, partly vacuolized, and partly with homogenized cytoplasm.Figure 2 Disrupted architecture of the liver with cirrhosis. Connective tissue fibres present in the form of wide or narrow stripes divide the liver parenchyma into pseudolobuli of unequal size and irregural shape (asterisk). Deposits of hematin pigment (arrow), HE. Endothelial cells of the blood vessels were also vacuolized, and sometimes necrotized and they were found free in the lumen. In close proximity to the altered blood vessels there was cellular infiltrate comprised of macrophages and eosinophil granulocytes. Groups or individual smooth muscle cells were sometimes observed in the connective tissue stripes, extravascularly (Figure 3).Figure 3 Vacuolized endothelial cells of the blood vessel (asterisk). Cellular infiltrate in the vessel wall comprised of macrophages and eosinophil granulocytes (arrow), HE. The connective tissue stripes contained numerous bile ducts of different diameter and individual epithelial cells similar to the epithelium of bile ducts. Bile duct epithelium-like epithelial cells were also seen between hepatocytes. Regenerated hepatocytes were organized into pseudolobuli of different size and of irregular, most often oval shape, without a central vein. The presence of macrophages filled with brown pigment was observed between hepatocytes and in the connective tissue stripes, and the brown pigment was sometimes also seen free in the connective tissue. The wall of certain bile ducts was thickened, and the epithelium proliferated to the form of edematous swelling and mucous metaplasia with a large number of cup-shaped cells. In addition to the described changes, a number of the samples were also seen to contain well encapsulated parasite cystoid formations in the liver parenchyma. These cystoid formations were characterised by a thick connective tissue capsule composed of fibroblasts, connective tissue fibers between which macrophage, lymphocytes, eosinophil granulocytes, and a smaller or larger number of cells with brown pigment were situated. Within this connective tissue capsule, there was necrotic detritus, fibrin, brown pigment, and remains of parasites. Close to the cystoid formations, hepatocytes were atrophic, and the liver lobes and pseudolobuli deformed.Immunohistochemistry In the sections of control deer livers, cells positive to α-SMA and desmin antibodies were scattered, diffusely, through the entire liver parenchyma. The positive reaction of pericytes and smooth muscle cells of terminal and sublobular venous blood vessels were observed. In the portal triads, a positive reaction was observed in the arterial tunica media, and slighter positivity was in the walls of the portal veins. Rare immunopositive cells were observed in Glisson’s capsule. In the livers with cirrhosis, immunopositivity to α-SMA (Figure 4) and desmin (Figure 5) was observed on cells in portal and septal spaces, at the edge beetween fibrotic septa and the surrounding parenchyma and in perisinusoidal spaces. Immunopositivity to α-SMA and desmin was observed also on the walls of blood vessels of the portal space, as well as in the increased septal connective tissue. Vascular smooth muscle cells and individual cells situated in connective tissue stripes were also strongly positive to α-SMA and desmin in livers with cirrhosis.Figure 4 Perisinusoidal star-like shape α-SMA positive HSCs with homogenous cytoplasm and long cytoplasmatic extensions (arrow) and elongated α-SMA positive MFs in fibrotic septa (asterisk), LSAB2.Figure 5 Perisinusoidal star-like shape desmin positive HSCs in liver parenchyma (arrow) and elongated desmin positive MFs in fibrotic septa (asterisk), LSAB2. Perisinusoidal α-SMA and desmin positive cells were recognized by their star-like shape, homogenous cytoplasm without vacuolization and long cytoplasmatic extensions which exibit a fine granular reaction. Morphological polymorphism was most expressed in α-SMA and desmin positive cells that are located in connective tissue stripes of livers with cirrhosis. These cells were round, oval, spindle-shaped, or irregular in shape, of varying sizes. Most of these cells, according to their morphological and phenotype characteristics, are similar to vascular smooth muscle cells. Elongated immunopositive cells with a poorly developed body and short cytoplasmatic extensions were found on the boundary between fibrotic septa and the surrounding parenchyma. The absence of cells positive to both examined markers was observed on the periphery of regenerative lobuli that occur in liver cirrhosis. Endothelial cells of liver blood vessels, hepatocytes and bile duct epithelium showed a negative reaction to the examined markers.Discussion It was proved that the giant liver fluke is present in the fallow deer population in the territory of Serbia. The finding of this parasite in the fallow deer population represents a threat as the giant liver fluke could spread to domestic ruminants which reside in close proximity to hunting grounds [1,4,5,7-9]. This paper is focused on pathohistological changes in the liver of fallow deer with parasitic cirrhosis caused by the giant liver fluke and the heterogeneity of the hepatic myofibroblast population. Changes corresponding to liver cirrhosis were established in 35 (52,24%) of the 67 examined fallow deer livers, with alterations in all liver structures, including the parenchyma, vascular and biliary system. The accumulation of extracellular matrix in the liver in the form of narrow or wide stripes, the forming of pseudolobuli and the presence of chronic cellular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages is accompanied by the presence of macrophages filled with parasite hematin and is a consequence of the host blood metabolism process in the parasite. Furthermore, the determined cystoid formations localized in the parenchyma and the morphological characteristics of the parasite are confirmation that these are changes caused by the giant liver fluke F. magna, and not by F. hepatica or Dicrocoelium dendriticum which primarily damage the intrahepatic biliary system [1,5,12,13]. Concerning the fact that cysts have only occasionally an epithelium covering part of the inner surface the term cystoid formation is more appropriate [5]. Livers of several fallow deer were found to contain proliferation of the epithelium of bile ducts which are framed with a large quantity of connective tissue. Hyperplasia of the bile duct epithelium is described in literature within infection with F. hepatica [12]. It is also possible to link the analogous changes found in fallow deer with proline synthesis and secretion on behalf of the parasite F. magna as it occurs in infection with F. magna [11]. Vascular changes are a consequence of traumatic phlebitis and increased accumulation of connective tissue. The compensatory increased arterial blood inflow leads to hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the tunica media [12,13]. It is possible to explain the increased amount of extracellular matrix, occurring as a consequence of the accumulation of different proteins, during myofibroblast activation, migration and accumulation. Imunohistochemical staining of cirrhotic livers proved that α-SMA and desmin positive cells present a heterogenic cell population regarding morphology and distribution. Progressive fibrillogenesis in fallow deer livers with parasite cirrhosis is most probably a consequence of the stepped up expression of α-SMA and desmin on portal, septal, interface, and perisinusoidal MFs. The established strong immunopositivity in myofibroblasts of connective tissue stripes, hyperplastic tunica media, as well as in extravascular smooth muscle cells is viewed by certain authors as a consequence of their role in pathological angiogenesis during the progression of chronic liver damage [28]. Our study has shown that hepatic MFs in fallow deer livers are a very heterogenic cell population, both regarding distribution and regarding morphology, similar as in humans and other animal species [18-27]. It is known that, in addition to MFs, other cell populations in the liver, such as damaged hepatocytes, activated Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells of sinusoids, also play a significant part in fibrogenesis [28]. The derangement of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions detected in chronic cholangiopathies is most likely the pro-fibrogenic mechanism in liver cirrhosis in fallow deer (Dama dama) infected with the giant liver fluke (Fascioloides magna). This is the first publication reporting morphological changes in liver in fallow deer (Dama dama) in Serbia.Conclusion Myofibroblasts, especially HSCs, play an important role in the synthesis of extracellular matrix components in the development of parasitic fibrosis and cirrhosis in the liver of fallow deer. Activated HSCs, as well as portal and septal myofibroblasts, correlate with the degree of liver fibrosis.Abbreviations α-SMA: Alpha-smooth muscle actin; MFs: Myofibroblasts; HSCs: Hepatic stellate cellsCompeting interests Hierby we disclose any financial and personal relationships with other people or organisations that could inappropriately influence our work.Authors’ contributions VK and MK contributed to conception and design, data analysis, drafting and writing of the manuscript.

Previous large scale linkage study in Northern Chinese has identified four significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for BMD variation on chromosome 2q24, 5q21, 7p21 and 13q21. We performed a replication study of these four QTL in 1,459 Southern Chinese from 306 pedigrees. Successful replication was observed on chromosome 5q21 for femoral neck BMD with a LOD score of 1.38 (nominal value = 0.006). We have previously identified this locus in a genome scan meta-analysis of BMD variation in a white population. Subsequent QTL-wide gene-based association analysis in 800 subjects with extreme BMD identified and as novel BMD candidate genes (empirical value of 0.032 and 0.014, respectively).

Introduction Family-based linkage analysis has successfully identified genes that contribute to relatively rare disorders with monogenic patterns of inheritance. In contrast, efforts to extend this family-based approach to common disorders and quantitative traits have been less successful. It is often particularly difficult to identify the causal variant under the quantitative trait loci (QTL). Linkage analysis is based on the principle of identification by decent (Cheung et al. 2010) to test the co-segregation of a genetic marker (e.g., microsatellite marker) and the trait-of-interest. The co-segregated genomic loci can also be very large, and multiple disease genes may be present under the QTL. In addition, although there may be only one disease gene in the QTL, the linkage signal may be elicited by multiple causal variants in the disease gene and in different families. The presence of allelic heterogeneity thus limits the ability to identify the causal variant using a SNP association approach. To date, more than fifteen genome-wide linkage scans for bone mineral density (BMD) have been performed in study populations of different ethnicity, of which two were Chinese. Niu et al. (1999) determined that 2p21 and 13q34 are modestly linked to forearm BMD in a genome-wide linkage scan conducted in 218 individuals from Anqing district. Hsu et al. (2007) observed significant evidence of linkage at 2q24 for total hip, 7p21 for femoral neck and 5q21 for combined BMD in 3,093 siblings from Anhui, and 13q21 for lumbar spine BMD in women in the same study population. With reported genetic heterogeneity between Northern and Southern Chinese, it is not known if these quantitative trait loci (QTL) are associated with BMD variation in Southern Chinese. In addition, the QTL genes have not been identified. Independent replication of linkage is a fundamental prerequisite for the commencement of positional cloning studies, in order to reduce the possibility of false positive initial finding. It is believed that some genes associated with BMD are likely to be site-specific and sex-specific; we therefore performed linkage analysis using high density microsatellite markers to investigate the linkage between four QTLs reported by Hsu et al. (2007) in a sample of 1,459 individuals from 306 Southern Chinese families of probands with low BMD. Subsequent gene-based association study was performed to identify potential QTL genes underlying the linkage peak.Methods and materialsSubjects for linkage and association analyses Subjects for the current study were drawn from an expanding database of more than 8,000 subjects at the Osteoporosis Centre, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. Subject recruitment has been ongoing since 1998 with individuals drawn from road shows and health talks on osteoporosis. Study subjects gave informed written consent and were invited to the Centre for bone mineral density measurement and physical examination. They were also interviewed by a trained research assistant using a structured questionnaire to obtain data on ethnicity, social, medical and reproductive history, dietary and lifestyle factors, and family history of osteoporosis. Families with a proband with BMD Z-score ≤ −1.28 (which is equivalent to the lowest 10% of the population) at either the lumbar spine or hip were identified. Individuals with a previous or family history of disease known to affect bone metabolism, premature menopause (age <40), bilateral oophorectomy or drug use that could affect bone turnover and BMD were excluded from study. All study subjects were of Southern Chinese Han descent. Based on the previous estimates of the heritability of BMD (Ng et al. 2006) and the relative informativeness of the 1,021 pedigrees in our cohort (Cheung et al. 2008), 306 families were selected for the current study. In the association study of QTL genes, 800 unrelated Hong Kong Southern Chinese (HKSC) women with extremely high (n = 376) or low BMD (n = 424) were selected from the same database as mentioned above. This study aimed to identify genetic factors that affect BMD variation in women. We adopted a threshold defined case–control study design. Subjects with BMD Z-score ≤ −1.28 at either the lumbar spine (LS) or femoral neck (FN) (the lowest 10% of the total population) were categorized as low-BMD subjects. High-BMD subjects comprised individuals with BMD Z-score ≥ +1.0 at either site (which is equivalent to the highest 15% of the total population). These selection criteria captured the extreme 25% BMD information of the total population. Subjects who reported the presence of disease or environmental factors that may affect BMD and bone metabolism were excluded from study. The recruitment procedure and exclusion criteria have been detailed elsewhere (Cheung et al. 2008) but the latter included the following: a history of chronic medical illness, premature menopause age below 40 years, malabsorption, previous major gastrointestinal surgery, metabolic bone disease, endocrine disorders including hyper- and hypothyroidism, or prescription of medication that may affect bone and calcium metabolism, hormone replacement therapy, anti-osteoporosis medication, and active vitamin D3 metabolites. The 800 studied subjects selected for the association study did not overlap with the pedigrees for linkage analysis.Measurement BMD (g/cm2) at the lumbar spine (L1–L4), femoral neck (FN), trochanter and total hip was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, Hologic QDR 2000 plus, Hologic, Waltham, MA, USA). The in vivo precision of the machine for lumbar spine, FN and total hip region was 1.2, 1.5 and 1.5%, respectively.Microsatellite and SNP genotyping Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of the subjects using a standard phenol/chloroform method. Nineteen selected microsatellite markers (Table 3) in close proximity to the four loci reported by Hsu et al. (2007) were selected using the marker order and map positions obtained from the Marshfield electronic database (http://www.research.marshfieldclinic.org/genetics/MarkerSearch/searchMarkers.asp). Fluorescently labeled PCR primers (ABI) were used to amplify the selected microsatellite loci. Electrophoresis and size determination of the amplified DNA fragments were performed using a Genetic Analyzer 3700 (ABI) and GENESCAN (ABI), respectively. Control DNA CEPH 1347-02 was used to monitor PCR amplification efficiency and control for gel-to-gel variation. For the gene-based association study, subjects were genotyped via the Infinium assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with Human610-quad chip including 564,214 SNPs. PLINK (version 1.04) used for data management and quality control statistics. After exclusion of individuals based on strict quality-control criteria, 785 individuals and 488,853 SNPs were retained for analysis. Subjects were excluded according to the following criteria: (1) genotyping call rate less than 95% (n = 5); (2) autosomal heterozygosity <27 or >31% (the same five subjects with low genotyping call rate); (3) related or identical to other individuals in the sample (n = 7); and (4) discordance of observed gender and estimated sex (n = 3). SNPs were excluded if: (1) genotyping call rate was ≤95% (1,158 SNPs), (2) Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) p value <1.0 × 10−4 (904 SNPs), and (3) minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.01 (73,589 SNPs). The average genotyping call rate of retained SNPs was 99.91%.Linkage analysis and gene-based association study Genotype inconsistencies were identified using Pedstats (Wigginton and Abecasis 2005) and linkage analysis conducted using Merlin-regress (Sham et al. 2002). To control for gender and age effects, a multi-point analysis was performed at 0.5 cM grid of equal-space locations for BMD Z-scores at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, trochanter and total hip in the whole population and all sub-groups. Sub-group analysis was performed by setting trait values for the uninterested subgroups as missing. A sex-averaged genetic map was adopted for the whole-sample analysis and a sex-specific map was applied for sub-group analysis. A heritability estimate of 0.7 was employed based on our previous heritability study of BMD at the spine and hip (Ng et al. 2006). A nominal p value of 0.01 is required to declare successful replication of a previously reported linkage signal (Lander and Kruglyak 1995). For the gene-based association study, QTL with a nominal p value <0.01 were selected for regional gene-based association study. Candidate genes located within the QTL were included in the analysis. We first obtained a standardized residual of BMD with adjustment of age and weight, since height was not significantly associated with BMD in our cohort. This standardized residual of BMD was normally distributed (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test p value >0.05). The association p value was obtained using PLINK (version 1.04) with the linear regression model testing the association between standardized residual of BMD with each SNP. For each SNP, the asymptotic p value for the relationship between the number of minor alleles and BMD was derived from a two-sided t statistic assuming the minor allele had an additive effect. The association p values were used to calculate gene-based test statistics of each gene (n = 18). The empirical p value was calculated as the proportion of simulated test statistics (using Monte Carlo approach) that exceeded the observed gene-based test statistic. In silico replication in 5,858 European subjects was performed using the p value obtained from a recent meta-analysis of GWAS of BMD (Styrkarsdottir et al. 2008). Gene-based analysis in each population was performed using VEGAS (Liu et al. 2010). The brief description of VEGAS is provided in supplementary information.In silico gene expression study In order to study whether the candidate genes are regulated by osteogenic molecule (bmp2) in murine MC3T3-1b pre-osteoblast cell line, we performed in silico gene expression study by retrieving the normalized microarray data [Accession number: GDS679) (Zamurovic et al. 2004)] from GEO database. Two datasets were compared, one was grown under the stimulation by bmp2 for 1 day, and the control was grown without stimulation of bmp2. The differences in total RNA expression in MC3T3-1b cells with and without stimulation by bmp2 and ascorbic acid were calculated using an independent t test.Results Clinical characteristics of the subjects for linkage and association studies are described in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Briefly, there were 306 Mendelian-consistent pedigrees, with 1,166 females and 293 males. The average size and number of generations of these pedigrees was 6.46 and 2.33, respectively. The overall drop-out rate of microsatellite markers was 3.65%. These genotypes were discarded due to either low intensity of the amplified PCR product or Mendelian inconsistency. The average heterozygosity of these markers was 0.777. Details of the 19 markers included in this study are shown in Table 3.Table 1 Demographic information of 1,459 individuals from 306 multi-generation pedigreesSubjectTotal (n = 1,459)Male (n = 293)Female (n = 1,166)Age (years)47.4 ± 15.349 ± 1647 ± 15.1Height (cm)157.8 ± 0.08167.8 ± 0.06155.2 ± 0.64Weight (kg)56.2 ± 10.466.3 ± 9.953.6 ± 8.9Post-menopausal women (N)485 (33.2%)NA485 (41.6%)Spine BMD (g/cm2)0.902 ± 0.1680.921 ± 0.1490.897 ± 0.172Femoral neck BMD (g/cm2)0.697 ± 0.1290.720 ± 0.1250.691 ± 0.130Trochanter BMD (g/cm2)0.604 ± 0.1210.644 ± 0.1130.594 ± 0.121Total hip BMD (g/cm2)0.797 ± 0.1430.856 ± 0.1360.782 ± 0.140Spine Z-score−0.33 ± 1.18−0.33 ± 1.18−0.33 ± 1.18Femoral neck Z-score−0.32 ± 1.04−0.33 ± 0.80−0.32 ± 1.09Trochanter Z-score−0.26 ± 1.11−0.22 ± 0.93−0.27 ± 1.15Total Hip Z-score−0.30 ± 1.15−0.19 ± 0.95−0.32 ± 1.20Spine T-score−0.80 ± 1.33−0.55 ± 1.17−0.86 ± 1.36Femoral neck T-score−0.85 ± 1.19−0.76 ± 0.86−0.86 ± 1.26Trochanter T-score−0.71 ± 1.25−0.55 ± 0.95−0.75 ± 1.32Total hip T-score−0.72 ± 1.30−0.61 ± 0.96−0.75 ± 1.37Table 2 Demographic information of 800 unrelated individuals with extreme BMDGroupHigh BMDLow BMDNumber376424Age (years)46.6 ± 14.851.1 ± 15.9Height (m)1.58 ± 0.061.53 ± 0.07Weight (kg)61.1 ± 9.949.1 ± 6.7Post-menopausal women (N)131 (34.8%)270 (63.7%)BMD Z-score Lumbar spine1.05 ± 0.78−1.59 ± 0.53 Femoral neck1.15 ± 0.79−1.36 ± 0.60 Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

Sub-group analysis was also performed, but no LOD score exceeded one. For other QTL, no region had LOD score exceeding one.Fig. 1 Multi-point LOD scores for linkage of BMD at lumbar spine, femoral neck, trochanter and total hip at (a) 2q24-32, (b) 5q21-22, (c) 7p21 and (d) 13q12-22 QTL on chromosome 5q with a nominal p value ≤0.01 were defined between 104.76 and 112.26 cM, equivalent to physical position 95,738,450–104,090,852 (hg 18) approximately. A total of 18 genes were annotated in this region: PCSK1, CAST, ERAP1, ERAP2, LNPEP, LIX1, RIOK2, RGMB, CHD1, FAM174A, ST8SIA4, SLCO4C1, SLCO6A1, PAM, GIN1, HISPPD1, C5orf30 and NUDT12. To identify a BMD gene(s) responsible for the QTL on chromosome 5p21-22 in Hong Kong Southern Chinese, we conducted a gene-based statistical analysis for femoral neck BMD on 800 unrelated individuals with extreme BMD using genotypes from 910 heterozygous SNPs (as defined by MAF >0.01) that were available in the Illumina Human 610 quad chip. Association analysis was restricted to femoral neck BMD, because the significant replication of linkage was observed only in femoral neck BMD. A linear regression model was used to calculate the SNP-based p value. Fifty-nine SNPs showed a higher than expected nominal p value of 0.05. Table 4 shows the results of gene-based association test of 18 genes with femoral neck BMD. Among the 18 genes, 2 genes CAST and ERAP1 showed empirical p value <0.05 after 100,000 rounds of simulation.Table 4 Gene-based association study of 18 genes located with QTL on 5q21-22 in HKSCGeneStartStopNo. of SNPsNo. of simulationsTestGene PBest SNPSNP PPCSK195,751,87495,794,70851,0001.4632010.823rs68606110.490CAST96,023,69696,136,14167100,000141.16460.0340.0002ERAP196,122,26996,169,64842100,000114.88470.024rs131605620.0002ERAP296,237,39996,281,162211,00013.26570.624rs29276120.040LNPEP96,297,10196,390,871181,0001.7715270.996rs23031380.611LIX196,453,32996,504,276291,00010.344030.926rs48691510.148RIOK296,524,39696,544,700241,00012.312680.823rs48691510.148RGMB98,132,89998,160,098161,00010.623980.608rs126528430.047CHD198,218,80798,290,138161,00012.152870.525rs93279190.036FAM174A99,899,02299,950,339151,0006.1973120.808rs2479380.150ST8SIA4100,170,802100,266,869171,00012.097120.521rs47031160.179SLCO4C1101,597,590101,660,152371,00045.637310.259rs104792000.004SLCO6A1101,735,550101,862,619371,00026.088280.542rs104792000.004PAM102,229,425102,393,316291,00017.70140.649rs4676930.094GIN1102,449,602102,483,74141,0003.4310250.430rs265210.073HISPPD1102,493,155102,566,80881,0003.5390950.573rs265210.073C5orf30102,622,340102,642,26091,0001.0945180.972rs1875800.608NUDT12102,912,454102,926,389291,00016.27710.831rs8610850.130 Gene-based p value <0.05 are bolded We then performed in silico replication using the data from 5,858 Northern European subjects to independently substantiate these gene-based association results in a separate ethnic population.

Meta-analysis using a weighted z-transformed test revealed a more significant p value of 0.019 and 0.007 for CAST and ERAP1, respectively (Table 5). To provide preliminary insight of the roles of CAST and ERAP1 in osteoblast, we retrieved the normalized expression data of CAST from the GEO dataset record GDS679. We observed that in the presence of BMP2 and ascorbic acid, CAST expression was significantly decreased by 37% when compared with control (without stimulation of ascorbic acid and bmp2) with a p value of 0.001. Since ERAP1 was not included in the microarray, no analysis was done.Table 5 Replication and meta-analysis of CAST and ERAP1 in 5,858 Northern European subjectsGeneNo. of SNPsNo. of simulationsTestGene PBest SNPSNP PMeta-PaQ statsPheteroCAST48100,00095.530.032rs423980.0100.019417.42<0.001ERAP131100,00087.420.014rs8450280.0040.007756.00<0.001 aMeta-analysis was done using weighted Z-transformed testDiscussion In this study, we replicated a previously reported linkage peak on 5q21-22 for femoral neck BMD (p = 0.006) in Hong Kong Southern Chinese and subsequently identified two BMD genes, CAST and ERAP1, using a gene-based association approach in HKSC and Northern European populations. Our bioinformatics analysis suggested that CAST is regulated by BMP in osteoblasts. In our previous meta-analysis of genome-wide scans in Caucasians, a broad region on chromosome 5 (5q14.3-q23.2) was identified as a femoral neck BMD QTL (Ioannidis et al. 2007). This bin nonetheless flanks more than 4 Mb in the genome and poses problems in identification of the QTL gene. Thus, this study is vital since it solved many of the problems: first, we successfully replicated this QTL in HKSC, suggesting that this BMD QTL is important in determining BMD in multiple ethnicity groups. Second, the linkage signal was only observed for femoral neck BMD, not for other skeletal sites, providing further evidence that this QTL is specific for femoral neck BMD determination. Third, we fine mapped the QTL to less than 1 Mb region using high density microsatellite markers. Fourth, the two BMD genes initially identified in HKSC were subsequently in silico replicated in Northern Europeans suggesting these genes affect BMD in both populations. This is in accordance with our observations in the previous meta-analysis and the current linkage result. Among the four QTL studied, we observed significant replication only on chromosome 5, and were unable to replicate other findings by Hsu et al. (2007) of the significant QTL on chromosome 2 (2q24), 7 (7p21) and 13 (13q21). Indeed, at these chromosomal locations, our peak LOD scores were less <1 (Fig. 1). This lack of replication in genetic loci between the two studies may be due to several factors. As with other complex disease genetic studies, power to localize QTL may be limited and result in between-study discrepancies. In addition, genetic factors vary across different ethnicities. The study by Hsu et al. (2007) focused on a Northern Chinese population, whereas our study examined Southern Chinese as the genetic backgrounds of different populations in different Chinese geographical areas that are known to differ (Xu et al. 2009). If relatively rare variants are involved in the determination of BMD variation, we may expect considerable differences in the localization of the most important genetic loci across different populations or within the same population at different geographic locations. Linkage studies of such complex traits cannot exclude the possibility of the presence of genetic regions for important QTLs. Thus, the lack of concordance cannot be interpreted as evidence to dispute the hypothesis that a QTL exists in a particular genomic region. Although linkage of BMD to 7p21 was not detected in the current study, linkage to 7p15-13, a well-replicated QTL in Caucasians, was confirmed in the same Southern Chinese family cohort. In the whole-sample analysis, evidence suggestive of linkage of total hip BMD to 7p14 (MLS = 2.75, nominal p = 0.0002) was observed (Li et al. 2010). In fact, the loci 7p15-13 is located just beside 7p21. The differences observed between our Southern Chinese population and the Anhui sample (Hsu et al. 2007) may be attributed to the population substructure of Han Chinese (Xu et al. 2009). Results from the linkage of femoral neck BMD detected a significant replication of QTL on chromosome 5q22-23 in HKSC participants. Further investigation of 18 genes within this region with p value ≤0.01 demonstrated genetic associations with two genes CAST and ERAP1. Notably, rs13160562 that showed the most significant p value was associated with these two genes as rs13160562 was located within 50 kb upstream and downstream region of these two gene loci. The femoral neck BMD Z-score for each genotype of rs13160562 is provided in Supplementary Figure 1. rs13160562 is located upstream of the gene CAST, but within the gene locus of ERAP1. Nonetheless, functional study is required to confirm whether this SNP affects CAST or ERAP1 or both. In silico replication study in Northern Europeans and the meta-analysis suggested that both genes may be important for BMD variation, although the p values of heterogeneity indicate the need for cautious interpretation. Nevertheless, to further support this observation, we used RNA expression data (Zamurovic et al. 2004) from the MC3T3-1B cell and found that there was a significant decrease in CAST mRNA expression upon stimulation of BMP2. These data suggest that CAST may be a negative modulator of BMD and a downstream target of BMP2 in modulating CAST mRNA expression of osteoblasts. This observation is in line with a study that suggested that calpain–calpastatin system is essential for osteoblast proliferation and differentiation although the system is regulated by BMP (Murray et al. 1997). CAST encodes for calpastatin, which is an endogenous calpain inhibitor. In MC3T3 preosteoblast cell line, calpastatin inhibits calpains and mediates the PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation, suggesting calpastatin is involved in PTH signaling pathway and bone metabolism (Shimada et al. 2005). ERAP1 encodes for endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1, which is a member of the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases. It regulates MHC class I antigen presentation (York et al. 2002) and associated with autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis (Sun et al. 2010) and ankylosing spondylitis (Chen et al. 2011), in the recent GWA meta-analyses. However, ERAP1 transcript was not noticed in the microarray data, thus it remains to be determined whether ERAP1 is functional in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Since 2007, a number of genome wide association studies for BMD variation have been published (Rivadeneira et al. 2009; Styrkarsdottir et al. 2008, 2009) with a number of well-known candidate genes and novel candidate genes confirmed or identified. Nevertheless, none of the genes suggested by the current study reached genome-wide significant level in these studies. This is not surprising as the ultraconservative Bonferroni correction inflates the false-negative rate (Cheung et al. 2010). Statistical power may also be further reduced by allelic heterogeneity in different ethnic groups although gene-based association study is an approach little influenced by allelic heterogeneity (Cheung et al. 2008). As such, this study had a number of advantages: first, we used family-based genetic data and successfully replicated and localized a common BMD QTL that has been implicated in Northern Chinese and meta-analysis in a relatively small genetic region. This is particularly important as the number of genes tested was reduced by the linkage analysis with high density microsatellite markers. Additionally, QTL-wide gene-based association study and meta-analysis identified two novel potential BMD genes in Southern Chinese and Northern Europeans. The function of one of these genes, CAST, in bone metabolism was further supported by an mRNA expression study suggesting this gene is a negative modulator of osteoblast differentiation. The current study involved the combined use of linkage, genetic association analysis and RNA expression data to account for potential variation within a given phenotype. Successful genetic association studies result in the localization of a gene or genetic region involved with the phenotype being investigated. Thus, various sources of independent data can be used to augment evidence for the involvement of a particular gene and improve assumptions regarding causal associations. There were nonetheless some limitations in this study. Our linkage cohort had sufficient power to detect QTL with large effect size, but not QTL with small effect size (Cheung et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2006). We only have replication data from the European population, despite the fact that the sample size is large. Moreover, a significant genetic heterogeneity was detected between two studies. The genetic heterogeneity could be contributed by the difference in study design, such as inclusion of both men and women in the Northern European study, but only women in the Southern Chinese study; random cohort design in the Northern European, but threshold defined case–control design in the Southern Chinese study. The p values of CAST and ERAP1 obtained in HKSC study did not pass Bonferroni correction, and the association signals are relatively marginal in all analyses. Successful in silico replication in Northern European and in silico expression analysis suggested that these two genes are less likely to be spurious findings although cautious interpretation is needed. Future replications and/or functional analysis will be required to examine the effect of these two genes on bone metabolism. In addition, this study could not confirm whether CAST or ERAP1 are the QTL genes in the pedigrees, since the association study was performed in a non-family based unrelated cohort. Nevertheless, our comprehensive analysis suggested that they are potentially important in bone metabolism. In summary, we replicated a QTL on chromosome 5q21-22 that influences femoral neck BMD in HKSC. Through association analysis of 18 genes in this region, we identified significant association between CAST and ERAP1 with femoral neck BMD variation. Future replication of these candidate genes will be required to validate our findings, while resequencing will be useful to better determine whether common and/or rare genetic variation within these two genes is associated with BMD variation.Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

Furthermore, little is known about the association of rs16996148 SNP and serum lipid levels in the Chinese population. We therefore aimed to detect the association of rs16996148 SNP and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Mulao and Han populations. A total of 712 subjects of Mulao nationality and 736 participants of Han nationality were randomly selected from our stratified randomized cluster samples. Genotyping of the rs16996148 SNP was performed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism combined with gel electrophoresis, and then confirmed by direct sequencing. The levels of apolipoprotein (Apo) B were higher in Mulao than in Han (< 0.001). The frequencies of G and T alleles were 87.2% and 12.8% in Mulao, and 89.9% and 10.1% in Han (0.05); respectively. The frequencies of GG, GT and TT genotypes were 76.0%, 22.5% and 1.5% in Mulao, and 81.2%, 17.4% and 1.4% in Han (0.05); respectively.

The levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, ApoAI, and ApoB in Han were different between the GG and GT/TT genotypes in males but not in females (< 0.05-0.001), the T allele carriers had higher serum levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, ApoAI, and ApoB than the T allele noncarriers. The levels of HDL-C, ApoAI, and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB in Mulao were correlated with the genotypes in males (< 0.05-0.01) but not in females. The levels of TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoAI and ApoB in Han were associated with the genotypes in males (< 0.05-0.001) but not in females.

Sex (male)-specific association of rs16996148 SNP in the and serum lipid levels is also observed in the both ethnic groups. Introduction Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries, and the prevalence of this disease is increasing rapidly in developing countries [1]. Consistent and compelling evidence has demonstrated association between dyslipidemia and CAD incidence worldwide [2-4]. It is well-established that dyslipidemia is a complex trait caused by multiple environmental and genetic factors [5-7] and their interactions [8,9]. Family studies suggest that in many populations, about half of the variation in serum lipid profiles is genetically determined [10,11], and it is clear that serum lipid levels are strongly influenced by the genetic constitution of each individual. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in different populations have identified more than 95 loci associated with serum lipid levels [5,12-46]. Common variants at these loci together explain < 10% of variation in each lipid trait [23,24,40]. Rare variants with large individual effects may also contribute to the heritability of lipid traits [40]. In addition, GWAS also discovered a number of novel loci that influence serum lipid phenotypes [15,17,21,39]. One of these newly identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is rs16996148 SNP in the NCAN/CILP2/PBX4. rs16996148 is located on chromosome 19p13 in an intergenic region between CILP2 and PBX4, which encodes a cartilage intermediate layer protein and a putative transcription factor expressed in testis, respectively [47,48]. Neurocan (NCAN) is a nervous system-specific proteoglycan involved in neuronal pattern formation, remodeling of neuronal networks and regulation of synaptic plasticity [49], with no obvious relation to LDL-C or TG concentrations. The roles of CILP2 and PBX4 in lipid metabolism are also unclear at this time [50,51]. In Europeans, however, rs16996148 in NCAN/CILP2/PBX4 has been showed significant associations with LDL-C and TG concentrations [15,17]. Tai et al. [51] also reported that rs16996148 SNP was significantly associated with LDL-C and HDL-C concentrations in the Malays under a recessive model of inheritance. Nevertheless, Nakayama et al. [50] did not observe significant associations between rs16996148 SNP and blood lipid profiles in the Japanese population. These results suggest that the ability of associations to generalize across other racial/ethnic populations varied greatly, some of these GWAS-identified variants may not be functional and are more likely to be in linkage disequilibrium with the functional variants. China is a multiethnic country with 56 ethnic groups. Han nationality is the largest ethnic group, and Mulao nationality is one of the 55 minorities with population of 207,352 according to the fifth national census statistics of China in 2000. Ninety percent of them live in the Luocheng Mulao Autonomous County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China. The history of this minority can be traced back to the Jin Dynasty (AD 265-420). In a previous study, Xu et al. [52] showed that the genetic relationship between Mulao nationality and other minorities in Guangxi was much closer than that between Mulao and Han or Uighur nationality. To the best of our knowledge, however, the association of rs16996148 SNP and serum lipid levels has not been previously reported in the Chinese population. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to detect the association of rs16996148 SNP in the NCAN/CILP2/PBX4 and several environmental factors with serum lipid profiles in the Mulao and Han populations.Materials and MethodsParticipants Participants in the present study included 712 individuals of Mulao nationality living in Luocheng Mulao Autonomous County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China. They were randomly selected from our previous stratified randomized cluster samples [53]. The ages of the participants ranged from 15 to 86 years, with an average age of 51.81 ± 14.76 years. There were 330 males (46.3%) and 382 females (53.7%). All participants were rural agricultural workers. During the same period, a total of 736 people of Han nationality who reside in the same villages were also randomly selected from our previous stratified randomized cluster samples. The average age of the subjects was 51.77 ± 14.96 years (range 15 to 86). There were 308 men (41.8%) and 428 women (58.2%). All of them were also rural agricultural workers. All study subjects were essentially healthy and had no evidence of any chronic illness, including hepatic, renal, or thyroid. The participants with a history of heart attack or myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, diabetes or fasting blood glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L determined by glucose meter were excluded from the analyses. The participants were not taking medications known to affect serum lipid levels (lipid-lowering drugs such as statins or fibrates, beta-blockers, diuretics, or hormones). The experimental design was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University. All participants in this study provided written informed consent.Epidemiological survey The survey was carried out using internationally standardized methods [54]. All participants underwent a complete history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, including cigarette smoking, family history of myocardial infarction, blood pressure, presence of diabetes mellitus. Information on demographics, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle factors was collected with standardized questionnaires. The alcohol information included questions about the number of liangs (about 50 g) of rice wine, corn wine, rum, beer, or liquor consumed during the preceding 12 months. Alcohol consumption was categorized into groups of grams of alcohol per day: ≤ 25 and > 25. Smoking status was categorized into groups of cigarettes per day: ≤ 20 and > 20. At the physical examination, several parameters were measured. Sitting blood pressure was measured three times with the use of a mercury sphygmomanometer after the subjects had a 5-minute rest, and the average of the three measurements was used for the level of blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure was determined by the first Korotkoff sound, and diastolic blood pressure by the fifth Korotkoff sound. Body weight, to the nearest 50 grams, was measured using a portable balance scale. Subjects were weighed without shoes and in a minimum of clothing. Height was measured, to the nearest 0.5 cm, using a portable steel measuring device. From these two measurements body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated.Determination of serum lipid levels Venous blood samples were collected after an overnight (at least 12 hours) fast. A part of the sample (2 mL) was collected into glass tubes and allowed to clot at room temperature, and used to determine serum lipid levels. Another part of the sample (3 mL) was transferred to tubes with anticoagulate solution (4.80 g/L citric acid, 14.70 g/L glucose, and 13.20 g/L tri-sodium citrate) and used to extract DNA. Serum TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels in the samples were measured according to standard enzymatic methods. Serum ApoAI and ApoB levels were detected by the immunoturbidimetric immunoassay. All determinations were performed with an autoanalyzer (Type 7170A; Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in the Clinical Science Experiment Center of the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University [6,7].DNA preparation and genotyping Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using the phenol-chloroform method [8,9]. The extracted DNA was stored at -80°C until analysis. Genotyping of the rs16996148 SNP was performed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). PCR amplification was performed using 5'-CATCCAGCATTTAGAGGTGTGA-3' and 5'-CTAGGGCAAAGGAAGTGTTTC-3' (Sangon, Shanghai, People's Republic of China) as the forward and reverse primer pairs; respectively. Each amplification reaction was performed using 100 ng (2 μL) of genomic DNA in 25 μL of reaction mixture consisting of 1.0 μL of each primer (10 μmo1/L), 12.5 μL 2 × Taq PCRMasterMix (constituent: 0.1 U Taq polymerase/μL, 500 μM dNTP each, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 100 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and stabilizers), and nuclease-free water 8.5 μL. After initial denaturizing at 95°C for 5 min, the reaction mixture was subjected to 33 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 45 s and extension 1 min at 72°C, followed by a final 5 min extension at 72°C. After electrophoresis on a 2.0% agarose gel with 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide, the amplification products were visualized under ultraviolet light. Then 2.5 U of Hin1II restriction enzyme, 8 μL nuclease-free water and 1 μL of 10 × buffer solution were added directly to the PCR products (5 μL) and digested at 37°C overnight. After restriction enzyme digestion of the amplified DNA, genotypes were identified by electrophoresis on 2.5% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium-bromide staining ultraviolet illumination. Genotypes were scored by an experienced reader blinded to epidemiological data and serum lipid levels.DNA sequencing Six samples (GG, GT and TT genotypes in two; respectively) detected by the PCR-RFLP were also confirmed by direct sequencing. The PCR products were purified by low melting point gel electrophoresis and phenol extraction, and then the DNA sequences were analyzed in Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co., Ltd., People's Republic of China.Diagnostic criteria The normal values of serum TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoAI, ApoB levels and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB in our Clinical Science Experiment Center were 3.10-5.17, 0.56-1.70, 1.16-1.42, 2.70-3.10 mmol/L, 1.20-1.60, 0.80-1.05 g/L, and 1.00-2.50; respectively [53]. The individuals with TC > 5.17 mmol/L and/or TG > 1.70 mmol/L were defined as hyperlipidemic [6,7,53]. Hypertension was diagnosed according to the criteria of 1999 World Health Organization-International Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the management of hypertension [55,56]. The diagnostic criteria of overweight and obesity were according to the Cooperative Meta-analysis Group of China Obesity Task Force. Normal weight, overweight and obesity were defined as a BMI < 24, 24-28, and > 28 kg/m2; respectively [57].Statistical analysis The statistical analyses were done with the statistical software package SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Quantitative variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (serum TG levels were presented as medians and interquartile ranges). Qualitative variables were expressed as percentages. Allele frequency was determined via direct counting, and the standard goodness-of-fit test was used to test the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Difference in genotype distribution between the groups was obtained using the chi-square test. The difference in general characteristics between two ethnic groups was tested by the Student's unpaired t-test. The association of genotypes and serum lipid parameters was tested by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking were included in the statistical models as covariates. Multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking were also performed to assess the association of serum lipid levels with genotypes (GG = 1, GT = 2, TT = 3; or GG = 1, GT/TT = 2) and several environment factors. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsGeneral characteristics and serum lipid levels Table 1 shows the general characteristics and serum lipid levels of the study population. The levels of ApoB and the percentages of subjects who consumed alcohol were higher but the levels of BMI and diastolic blood pressure were lower in Mulao than in Han (P < 0.05-0.001). There were no significant differences in the levels of age, body height, weight, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, blood glucose, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoAI; the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB; the percentages of subjects who smoked cigarettes; and the ratio of male to female between the two ethnic groups (P > 0.05 for all).Table 1 The general characteristics and serum lipid levels in the Mulao and Han populationsParameterMulaoHan Chineset (χ2)PNumber712736--Male/female330/382308/4282.9740.090Age (years)51.81 ± 14.7651.77 ± 14.960.0580.954Height (cm)155.44 ± 7.72154.71 ± 7.931.7740.076Weight (kg)52.88 ± 9.0353.72 ± 8.85-1.8030.072Body mass index (kg/m2)21.83 ± 3.0022.43 ± 3.32-3.6000.000Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)129.16 ± 21.47129.58 ± 18.67-0.3970.692Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)80.90 ± 11.6082.27 ± 11.05-2.2980.022Pulse pressure (mmHg)48.25 ± 16.0747.30 ± 14.191.1870.235Blood glucose5.96 ± 1.545.96 ± 1.61-0.0960.923Cigarette smoking [n (%)] Nonsmoker519 (72.9)532 (72.3) ≤ 20 cigarettes/day159 (22.3)178 (24.2) > 20 cigarettes/day34 (5.8)26 (3.5)1.9010.386Alcohol consumption [n (%)] Nondrinker516 (72.5)565 (76.8) ≤ 25 g/day67 (9.4)79 (10.7) > 25 g/day129 (18.1)92 (12.5)9.0070.011Total cholesterol (mmol/L)5.02 ± 1.295.02 ± 1.030.0400.968Triglyceride (mmol/L)1.05 (0.81)1.07 (0.91)-0.5620.574HDL-C (mmol/L)1.75 ± 0.461.75 ± 0.53-0.1710.864LDL-C (mmol/L)2.92 ± 0.882.91 ± 0.850.3370.736Apolipoprotein (Apo) AI (g/L)1.33 ± 0.401.35 ± 0.26-1.4560.146ApoB (g/L)0.97 ± 0.540.86 ± 0.205.2020.000ApoAI/ApoB1.61 ± 0.951.66 ± 0.51-1.4090.159 HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Thus, GG genotype is heterozygote for the absence of the site (bands at 242 bp), GT genotype is heterozygote for the absence and presence of the site (bands at 242-, 221- and 21-bp), and TT genotype is homozygote for the presence of the site (bands at 221- and 21- bp; Figure 2). The 21 bp fragments were invisible in the gel owing to its fast migration speed. The genotype distribution of rs16996148 SNP followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.Figure 1 Electrophoresis of PCR products of the samples. Lane M, 100 bp marker ladder; lanes 1-5, samples.

The G and T allele frequencies of rs16996148 SNP were 87.2% and 12.8% in Mulao, and 89.9% and 10.1% in Han (P <0.05); respectively. The frequencies of GG, GT and TT genotypes were 76.0%, 22.5% and 1.5% in Mulao, and 81.2%, 17.4% and 1.4% in Han (P <0.05); respectively. There were no significant differences in the genotypic and allelic frequencies between males and females in both groups.Table 2 The genotypic and allelic frequencies of rs16996148 SNP the Mulao and Han populations [n (%)]GroupnGenotypeAlleleGGGTTTGTMulao712541 (76.0)160 (22.5)11 (1.5)1242 (87.2)182 (12.8)Han736598 (81.2)128 (17.4)10 (1.4)1324 (89.9)148 (10.1)χ2-6.0605.329P-0.0480.022Mulao Male330243 (73.6)79 (24.0)8 (2.4)565 (85.6)95 (14.4) Female382298 (78.0)81 (21.2)3 (0.8)677 (88.6)87 (11.4) χ2-4.1132.871 P-0.1280.095Han Male308246 (79.9)60 (19.5)2 (0.6)552 (89.6)64 (10.4) Female428352 (82.2)68 (15.9)8 (1.9)772 (90.2)84 (9.8) χ2-3.4150.132 P-0.1810.726Genotypes and serum lipid levels As shown in Table 3, the levels of HDL-C in Mulao were different among the three genotypes (P < 0.05), the T allele carriers had higher serum HDL-C levels than the T allele noncarriers.

There were no significant differences in the remaining serum lipid parameters between the two ethnic groups. It is well known that dyslipidemia is the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors [6-9]. Both family and twin studies suggest that in many populations, about 40-60% of the variation in serum lipid profiles is genetically determined [10,11], and it is clear that LDL-C, HDL-C and TG concentrations are strongly influenced by the genetic constitution of each individual. The engagements of Mulao nationality were family-arranged in childhood, usually with the girl being four or five years older than the boy. There was a preference for marriage to mother's brother's daughter. Engagement and marriage were marked by bride-wealth payments. Marriage ceremonies were held when the girl reached puberty. She remained with her natal family until her first child was born. Till then she was free to join the young men and women who came together for responsive singing, flirtations, and courtships at festival times. Divorce and remarriage were permitted, with little restriction. The two-generation household is the most common unit of residence. Households are under the control of the father, and divide when the sons marry, with only the youngest son remaining with the parents. Therefore, we believe that the genetic background and some lipid-associated genetic variants in this population may be different from those in Han nationality. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of rs16996148 SNP in the NCAN/CILP2/PBX4 in diverse racial/ethnic groups are inconsistent. The frequency of T allele was 8% in European Americans, 15% in African Americans, 4% in American Indians, 6% in Mexican Americans and Hispanics [40], and 12% in Japanese [50]. The minor allele frequency in the Malay population was 17% [51]. In the present study, we showed that the T allele frequency of rs16996148 SNP was higher in Mulao than in Han (12.8% vs. 10.1%, P <0.05). The frequencies of GG, GT and TT genotypes were also different between the two ethnic groups (P <0.05). There were no significant differences in the genotypic and allelic frequencies between males and females in both ethnic groups. These results indicate that the prevalence of the T allele variant of the rs16996148 SNP may have a racial/ethnic specificity. The potential relationship between the rs16996148 SNP and plasma or serum lipid levels in humans has been evaluated in several previous studies (GWAS). However, previous findings on the association of this SNP with the changes in plasma lipid levels are inconsistent. The rs16996148 SNP in NCAN/CILP2/PBX4 has been shown significant associations with LDL-C and TG concentrations in Europeans [15,17]. The minor allele (T allele) of rs16996148 SNP was associated with lower concentrations of both LDL-C (by ~16 mg/dl) and TG [15]. Tai et al. [51] also reported that rs16996148 SNP was significantly associated with lower LDL-C and elevated HDL-C concentrations in the Malays under a recessive model of inheritance [51]. Nevertheless, Nakayama et al. [50] did not observe significant associations between rs16996148 and blood lipid profiles in the Japanese population. In the current study, we found that the levels of HDL-C, ApoAI, and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB in Mulao were different between the GG and GT/TT genotypes in males but not in females, the subjects with GT/TT genotypes had higher serum levels of HDL-C, ApoAI, and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB than the subjects with GG genotype. The levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, ApoAI, and ApoB in Han were different between the GG and GT/TT genotypes in males but not in females, the T allele carriers had higher serum levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, ApoAI, and ApoB than the T allele noncarriers. The levels of HDL-C, ApoAI, and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB in Mulao were correlated with the genotypes in males but not in females. The levels of TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoAI and ApoB in Han were correlated with the genotypes in males but not in females. These findings suggest that there is a sex-specific association of rs16996148 SNP in the NCAN/CILP2/PBX4 and serum lipid levels in our study populations. It is well known that environmental factors such as dietary patterns, lifestyle, obesity, physical activity, and hypertension are all strongly related with serum lipid levels [6,7]. Furthermore, exposure to different lifestyles and environments in our populations resident in Guangxi may further modify the effect of genetic variation on blood lipids. In the present study, we also showed that serum lipid parameters were correlated with age, sex, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, BMI, and blood pressure in both ethnic groups. These data suggest that the environmental factors also play an important role in determining serum lipid levels in our populations. Although rice and corn are the staple foods in both ethnic groups, the people of Mulao nationality like to eat cold foods along with acidic and spicy dishes, so bean soy sauce and pickled vegetables are among their most popular dishes. They also like to eat animal offals which contain abundant saturated fatty acid. The effects of dietary macronutrients on serum lipid levels and their effects on CAD have been extensively studied [58-62]. Almost 40 y ago, the Puerto Rican Heart Study found lower mean concentrations of TC and TG in Puerto Ricans than in subjects in the Framingham Heart Study [63]. Among urban Puerto Rican men, TC was positively associated with the percentage of energy from total fat, saturated fatty acids (SFAs), simple sugars, and protein and negatively associated with the percentage of energy from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), total carbohydrate, and PUFA/SFA. Overall, diet and relative weight can account for at most 6% of the variability in serum cholesterol observed, with at most 2.5% of the variability due diet alone [63].Conclusion The present study shows that the T allele frequency of rs16996148 SNP in the NCAN/CILP2/PBX4 is significantly higher in Mulao than in Han. The frequencies of GG, GT and TT genotypes are also different between the two ethnic groups. The subjects with GT/TT genotypes in Mulao had higher serum levels of HDL-C, ApoAI, and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB than the subjects with GG genotype in males but not in females. The T allele carriers in Han had higher serum levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, ApoAI, and ApoB than the T allele noncarriers in males but not in females. These lipid parameters were also correlated with the genotypes in males but not in females. These results suggest that there is a sex-specific association of rs16996148 SNP in the NCAN/CILP2/PBX4 and serum lipid levels in our study populations.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributions TTY participated in the design, undertook genotyping, and helped to draft the manuscript.

Neutrophils are deprived of proliferative capacity and have a tightly controlled lifespan to avoid their persistence at the site of injury. We have recently described that the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a nuclear factor involved in DNA replication and repair of proliferating cells is a key regulator of neutrophil survival. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization occurred during granulocytic differentiation and is dependent on a nuclear export sequence thus strongly suggesting that PCNA has physiologic cytoplasmic functions. In this review, we will try to put into perspective the physiologic relevance of PCNA in neutrophils. We will discuss key issues such as molecular structure, post-translational modifications, based on our knowledge of nuclear PCNA, assuming that similar principles governing its function are conserved between nuclear and cytosolic PCNA. The example of cystic fibrosis that features one of the most intense neutrophil-dominated pulmonary inflammation will be discussed.

INTRODUCTION In the acute phase of inflammatory diseases, neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of injury or infection where they engulf and kill invading microorganisms (Witko-Sarsat et al., 2000). Moreover, recent studies have underscored an unsuspected neutrophil plasticity that can influence and shape the immune response (Mantovani et al., 2011). Neutrophil apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death that prevents the release of neutrophil histotoxic contents, should be tightly regulated (Kennedy and DeLeo, 2009; Fox et al., 2010) to limit the destructive capacity of neutrophil products to surrounding tissues (Nathan, 2006). The subsequent recognition and phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages is central to the successful resolution of an inflammatory response. However, it has been reported that neutrophils can phagocytosed apoptotic cells and might participate in the clearance of apoptotic neutrophils at the site of inflammation (Esmann et al., 2010). It is increasingly apparent that the dying neutrophil itself exerts anti-inflammatory effects through modulation of surrounding cell responses (Kobayashi et al., 2002), particularly macrophage inflammatory cytokine release (Ariel and Serhan, 2012). In several inflammatory diseases including arthritis (Wright et al., 2010), vasculitis (Abdgawad et al., 2012), or cystic fibrosis (CF; McKeon et al., 2008; Moriceau et al., 2009,2010), neutrophil apoptosis was delayed, thus potentiating the deleterious inflammatory response. Recent studies have highlighted the complexity of neutrophil death mechanisms and uncovered the involvement of novel pathways (Geering and Simon, 2011). Neutrophil survival induced for instance by cytokine such as G-CSF involves a complex gene pattern as evidence by gene array studies (Drewniak et al., 2009). As an example, we have identified the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as a key element controlling neutrophil survival. In neutrophils, that are non-proliferating cells, PCNA localization was strictly cytosolic and correlated with the grade of their viability (Witko-Sarsat et al., 2010).A SOPHISTICATED REGULATION OF APOPTOSIS IS REQUIRED TO CONTROL NEUTROPHIL ACTIVATION Like other cells, a neutrophil possesses both pro-survival and death pathways, the balance of which determines its fate (Witko-Sarsat et al., 2011). Several studies have unraveled the standard cascade of events, which classically include mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) followed by release of cytochrome c (that is very weak in neutrophils) and other pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytosol, caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, loss of membrane asymmetry, formation of apoptotic bodies (Geering and Simon, 2011; Kepp et al., 2011) and, finally, generation of “eat me signals” that stimulate the uptake of apoptotic cells by phagocytes (Paidassi et al., 2009). In neutrophils, the apoptotic machinery presents specific features that render these cells peculiar and very interesting to study as a model in which apoptosis control is cell cycle-independent because they cannot proliferate (Witko-Sarsat et al., 2011). Hence, a complete cell cycle arrest was observed in band cells and segmented neutrophils from bone marrow and in circulating mature neutrophils (Theilgaard-Monch et al., 2005). Expression patterns of apoptosis genes studied by microarray indicated that death control occurred by the p53 pathway in promyelocytes and by death receptor pathways in bone marrow neutrophils. Neutrophil apoptosis is inhibited by a continuous expression of the short lifespan Bcl-2 homolog myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1; Thomas et al., 2010). It has been clearly shown that neutrophil survival was regulated by the inducible expression of the short-lived Mcl-1 (Moulding et al., 2001). In that respect, Mcl-1 can be considered as a potential target to modulate neutrophil’s fate (Milot and Filep, 2011). However, the molecular mechanisms controlling this “spontaneous or constitutive” apoptosis still remain obscure: it is not clear whether neutrophil apoptosis occurred because of the lack of external surviving signals or because of its “internal clock”. It has been reported that deactivation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate/Akt signaling mediates neutrophil spontaneous death (Zhu et al., 2006). Accordingly, neutrophils depleted of Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a phosphatase that negatively regulates Akt activity, live much longer than wild-type neutrophils. Some surprising insights into neutrophil survival mechanisms came when cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) happened to play a key role in the regulation of neutrophil survival (Rossi et al., 2006). Notably, CDK are implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and constitute targets for anti-cancer therapies (Malumbres et al., 2009). Inhibition of CDK by roscovitine can trigger neutrophil apoptosis by interfering with the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and with neutrophil transcrip- tional capacities thereby inducing neutrophil apoptosis (Leitch et al., 2012).PCNA: A NOVEL PLAY FOR THIS FASCINATING ACTOR THAT ESCAPES FROM NUCLEUS TO MEDIATE NEUTROPHIL SURVIVAL An unanticipated finding came with our discovery that PCNA, an ancestral nuclear protein involved in DNA replication, was present in resting neutrophil cytosol and was degraded upon apoptosis. In fact, PCNA happened to be an actor of neutrophil survival (Witko-Sarsat et al., 2010) but it remains to be investigated whether it could regulate “the neutrophil internal clock”. Historically, PCNA was described as an antigen for autoimmune disease in systemic lupus erythematosus patients, detected only in the proliferating cells (Mahler et al., 2012). The tight association of PCNA with cancer transformation resulted in the use of PCNA as a diagnostic and prognostic cell cycle marker in tumors (Stoimenov and Helleday, 2009). With the aim to start understanding the molecular mechanisms whereby PCNA exerts its anti-apoptotic activities and how the cytosolic PCNA scaffold is regulated, we will next discuss key issues based on our knowledge of nuclear PCNA, assuming that similar principles governing its function are conserved between nuclear and cytosolic PCNA.A UNIQUE BUT CONSERVED TRIDIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE Proliferating cell nuclear antigen is a ubiquitous protein that has a unique ring-shaped structure (Krishna et al., 1994) and a highly conserved amino acid sequence (Prosperi, 2006). PCNA has been identified in all eukaryotes from unicellular organisms to humans. Striking is the similarity in molecular structure between yeast and human that share 35% amino acid sequences identity but have highly superimposable three-dimensional structure (Stoimenov and Helleday, 2009). Trimeric PCNA exhibits sixfold symmetry as a result of having two globular domains in each monomer (Figure 1). The importance of PCNA in DNA replication is tightly linked with its ring-shaped structure that allows to slide freely on duplex DNA (Kelman, 1997). Remarkably, PCNA mutants that cannot form trimers failed to stimulate the polymerase Pol δ (Jonsson et al., 1995). Deletion of the PCNA gene in the yeast showed that PCNA was an essential protein required for DNA replication and knocking out the PCNA gene in mice was lethal (Kelman, 1997).FIGURE 1 Dual life of PCNA: from nucleus to cytosol. (A) PCNA is a scaffold protein, which acts as a trimer (represented here in red–blue–green) as shown by its molecular tridimensional structure (PDB ID: 1VYM, PyMOL Molecular Graphics System). PCNA forms a ring-shaped complex, which can encircle the DNA and orchestrate DNA replication and reparation. PCNA monomers have two similar globular domains, linked by a long flexible loop called the interdomain-connecting loop that binds numerous PCNA partners including p21/waf1. A synthetic peptide from the sequence of p21/waf1 (represented here in yellow) is bound to this interdomain-connecting loop. The nuclear export sequence (NES) is composed of a central helix (represented here with orange balls) localized in the inner face of the PCNA trimer. (B) In proliferating cells such as the myeloid CD34+ precursor cells, PCNA is nuclear as shown by PCNA immunolabeling (in red) and DNA staining with Hoechst (in blue). The purple color results from the colocalization between PCNA and DNA within nucleus. PCNA is a trimeric ring (represented in green), which exerts its activity during DNA replication by braceleting DNA. PCNA has an important role in DNA synthesis because it is part of the polymerase Pol δ holoenzyme (represented in orange). (C) In contrast, in neutrophils, PCNA is localized exclusively within the cytosol as shown by the red color of the cytoplasm and the blue nuclei with its typical polylobular form. During granulocytic differentiation, there is a nuclear-to-cytosol relocalization that involves a NES that we have recently characterized (Bouayad et al., 2012). In neutrophils, under pro-survival conditions, cytosolic PCNA is associated with multiple partners, including procaspases-3, -8, -9, and -10 to prevent their activation, and is stabilized by the treatment of neutrophils with G-CSF (Witko-Sarsat et al., 2010). On the opposite, death signals, either directly or indirectly can target PCNA, leading to a disruption of the PCNA scaffold and thus triggering apoptosis (Witko-Sarsat et al., 2011). Further studies are required to characterize PCNA structure, to identify its partners and to understand how cytosolic PCNA can regulate neutrophil survival.PCNA: THE SECOND TO NONE IN THE COORDINATION OF COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES One key issue is that PCNA has no known enzymatic activity but can interact with a diverse array of proteins and cellular factors to regulate their activities: PCNA has been named the “professional recruiting agent” or more elegantly the “dancer with multiple partners” (Maga and Hubscher, 2003). PCNA-interacting proteins can be classified into two groups (Moldovan et al., 2007): the first consists of enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism, including DNA replication [replication factor C (RFC), DNA polymerase δ and ε, FEN-1, DNA ligase I] and repair (MutL homolog 1, MutS homolog 2, Uracil-DNA glycosylase 2) that are localized for the majority exclusively in nucleus. In contrast, the second group consists of cell cycle regulatory proteins (p21/waf1/Cip1, p57, CDK2, growth arrest and DNA damage (Gadd45), and the myeloid-differentiation primary-response (MyD118), Mcl-1) that localized both within the nuclei or the cytoplasmic compartment depending on the cell type. Except for Mcl-1, the major anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homolog expressed in neutrophils (Thomas et al., 2010), these latter PCNA partners have not been studied in the neutrophil survival context. We have previously shown that, in mature neutrophils, PCNA was constitutively associated with procaspase-3, procaspase-8, procaspase-9, and procaspase-10, presumably sequestering them within the cytosol to prevent their activation. In line with this notion, recombinant PCNA was shown to interfere with in vitro procaspase 9 activation (Witko-Sarsat et al., 2010), thus strongly suggesting that PCNA association with procaspases represents a way to block their activation.p21/waf1 DESTABILIZED THE PCNA SCAFFOLD AND TRIGGERED NEUTROPHIL APOPTOSIS p21/waf1 is a well characterized PCNA partner that has been identified in a protein complex containing PCNA, cyclin, and CDK (Xiong et al., 1992; Waga et al., 1994). p21/waf1 is a p53-responsive gene but p21 expression can also be p53-independent (Biggs and Kraft, 1995). The p21 has two different inhibitory effects on the entry of the cell into S-phase. One is to inhibit the kinase activity of CDK and the other is to inhibit DNA replication via an interaction with PCNA (Goubin and Ducommun, 1995). Based on previous studies, synthetic peptides such as the carboxy-p21 peptide (residues 141–160 on the p21/waf1 sequence) carrying the consensus sequence for binding to the PCNA interdomain-connecting loop (Figure 1) was shown to act as an effective competitor for PCNA partners and to interfere with its functions (Warbrick, 2000). Remarkably, this carboxy-p21 triggered neutrophil apoptosis and concomitant PCNA degradation, in addition to impair the capacity of G-CSF to prolong neutrophil survival in vitro (Witko-Sarsat et al., 2010). Thus, the observation that the carboxy-p21 triggered neutrophil apoptosis by disturbing the PCNA scaffold clearly showed to us that PCNA is pivotal in maintaining neutrophil survival. Whether p21/waf1 expression controls the PCNA scaffold in neutrophils has not been investigated yet. The expression of p21 has been shown to be downregulated during granulocytic differentiation (Yaroslavskiy et al., 1999) and its expression in mature neutrophils is low under resting conditions (Klausen et al., 2004). Surprisingly, p21 mRNA has been shown to be strongly upregulated in vivo in human neutrophils isolated from bronchoalveolar lavages following LPS intratracheal instillation (Coldren et al., 2006). Whether p21–PCNA interaction could play a role in neutrophil survival will require further investigations.CYTOSOL AS A PHYSIOLOGIC PLAYGROUND FOR PCNA ACTION The peculiar exclusive cytoplasmic localization was a feature of mature neutrophils as, for instance, PCNA was detectable exclusively in the nucleus of CD34+ cells or in myeloblasts isolated from human bone marrow aspirates (Witko-Sarsat et al., 2010). More recently we have provided evidence of an active PCNA nuclear export that involved the chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) exportin (Turner et al., 2012). Accordingly, leptomycin B, an inhibitor of the CRM1 exportin inhibited this PCNA relocalization during granulocytic differentiation of human primary CD34+ cells or in promyelocytic cell lines (Bouayad et al., 2012). Using enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion constructs, we demonstrated that PCNA relocalization involved a nuclear export signal (NES) located from I11 to I23 in the PCNA sequence. However, this NES, located at the inner face of the PCNA trimer (Figure 1) was not functional in wild-type PCNA, but instead, was fully active and leptomycin B-sensitive in the monomeric PCNAY114A mutant. We also provided evidence that nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization that occurred physiologically during myeloid differentiation was essential for PCNA anti-apoptotic activity in mature neutrophils. It is noteworthy that the PCNA NES was extremely conserved between species (Bouayad et al., 2012) thus suggesting that this CRM1-dependent export of PCNA was part of the physiologic PCNA trafficking presumably occurring in cells other than neutrophils, thus uncovering a novel aspect of PCNA functions. Notably, the presence of PCNA has been recently described in the cytosol of cancer cells (Naryzhny and Lee, 2010).POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS OF CYTOSOLIC PCNA: A KEY IN NEUTROPHIL SURVIVAL? Another level of complexity in the ballet of PCNA partners within nucleus, is the multiplicity of PCNA post-translational modifications that modulate specific protein interactions (Moldovan et al., 2007). In fact, phosphorylation (although controversial), ubiquitination, sumoylation, and acetylation that have been described for nuclear PCNA offer a great deal of options to modulate PCNA activities (Naryzhny and Lee, 2004). In neutrophils, we have observed that PCNA was ubiquitinated and was degraded via the proteasome during apoptosis (Witko-Sarsat et al., 2010). The levels of PCNA were found to time-dependently decrease in neutrophils undergoing apoptosis regardless of whether the triggering signaling cascade passed through the extrinsic (death receptors) or the intrinsic pathway (mitochondria). Since proteasome inhibitors reversed such a PCNA diminution, we concluded that a proteasome-mediated PCNA degradation, triggered along both the death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic cascades, was responsible for apoptosis-induced PCNA degradation.MODULATING PCNA SCAFFOLD IN NEUTROPHIL-DRIVEN INFLAMMATION: THE MODEL OF CYSTIC FIBROSISTHE PROMINENT ROLE OF NEUTROPHIL IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS AIRWAY INFLAMMATION Cystic fibrosis which is a lethal autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation of the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene, is characterized by an intense neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation (Cantin, 1995) and a chronic bacterial colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Plugging in small airways contributes to the morbidity and mortality in CF (Burgel et al., 2007), leading to respiratory failure and the need for lung transplantation (Burgel and Nadel, 2008). The prognosis is tightly linked with the severity of the inflammatory process. Hence, the extraordinary numbers of neutrophils accumulating within airways of CF patients has led to the hypothesis of an innate immunity failure (Bals et al., 1999). Today, the current treatment involves antibiotherapy and mucolytic drugs but therapeutic intervention in CF remains a challenge (Pier, 2012). Anti-inflammatory drugs for CF lung disease appear to have some beneficial effects on disease progression. These agents include oral corticosteroids and ibuprofen, as well as azithromycin, which, in addition to its antimicrobial effects, also possess anti-inflammatory properties. Inhaled corticosteroids, antioxidants, nutritional supplements, and protease inhibitors have a limited impact on the disease. Adverse effects limit therapy with oral corticosteroids and ibuprofen (Narasimhan and Cohen, 2011). Hence, the lack of promising candidate emphasizes the need for fresh approaches in the management of airway inflammation in CF, for instance by targeting neutrophil apoptosis in combination with antibiotherapies. Previous studies on CF patient’s neutrophils indicated functional disturbances in bacterial phagocytosis, killing, and other effector functions (Downey et al., 2009). Because of the extreme heterogeneity of CF patients in terms of infectious status (Witko-Sarsat et al., 1999), the comparisons of experiments and results are difficult. Indeed, we have previously shown that neutrophils from CF parents who were heterozygous for CFTR mutation, had also disturbed neutrophil functions thus suggesting the possibility of an innate neutrophil defect in CF (Witko-Sarsat et al., 1996; Moriceau et al., 2010). Accordingly, a recent study has provided evidence that the absence of the CFTR from myeloid-derived cells slows the resolution of inflammation (Bonfield et al., 2012). Gene-expression patterns of neutrophils from clinically stable and healthy controls have shown dramatic differences (Adib-Conquy et al., 2008). This was consistent with a perturbed “inflammatory program” in CF neutrophils (Hayes et al., 2011), which remains to be investigated (Tirouvanziam et al., 2008). It should also be mentioned that perpetuation of inflammation in the CF airway may also be amplified by defective macrophage clearance mechanisms. It has been shown that persistence of infection in CF was partly due to ineffective uptake and killing of pathogens due to a defective macrophage innate response (Wright et al., 2009). Notably, a defect in apoptotic cell clearance has also been reported in CF (Vandivier et al., 2002).DYSREGULATED NEUTROPHIL APOPTOSIS: A POTENTIAL TARGET FOR THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION Given the number of neutrophils in CF airways (Danel et al., 1996; Figure 2A), late neutrophil apoptosis could have devastating consequences. This neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation typical of the CF condition is representative of a chronic but active inflammatory process with neutrophil persistence suggesting a defect in apoptotic neutrophil clearance by macrophages (Figure 2B). Indeed, we (Moriceau et al., 2010) and others (McKeon et al., 2008) reported that neutrophils from CF patients undergo delayed apoptosis and have decreased levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax (Dibbert et al., 1999), thereby slowing their removal by macrophages and potentiating airway inflammation. In an attempt to modulate the delayed apoptosis in neutrophils from CF patients, roscovitine was used at 10 μM to restore normal apoptosis levels for CF PMN (Moriceau et al., 2010). Whether CDK-mediated survival pathway could crosstalk with the PCNA scaffold is currently unknown and would require more investigations.FIGURE 2 Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in neutrophils within airways from CF patients. (A) Neutrophils and macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) from a control donor and from a patient with CF. The control BAL was composed mainly of alveolar macrophages. In contrast, in BAL from CF 95% of the cells are neutrophils either viable or apoptotic. Few macrophages and lymphocytes are present as well as cell debris and mucus (Giemsa stain ×630 original magnification). (B) Neutrophil-dominated inflammation in lung explants from a CF patient. Acute inflammation within the lung in CF patient with characteristic histologic features: (1) inflammatory infiltrate with neutrophils (black circle and arrow) and lymphocytes in the lamina propria, (2) transepithelial neutrophil migration (red circles), and (3) accumulation of degenerating and apoptotic neutrophils in the lumen (red arrow; Hematoxylin–Eosin–Safran staining ×200 original magnification). Lung explant specimens from CF patients were obtained at transplantation (Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou). (C) Immunoperoxidase labeling of PCNA on paraffin sections of lung explants from a CF patient. Labeling was performed using a rabbit polyclonal anti-PCNA antibody (Ab5, diluted 1:100, Calbiochem) and immunoperoxidase detection (Dako) as previously described (Moriceau et al., 2009; ×630 original magnification). The airway lumen contents neutrophils expressing PCNA (upper left panel). Neutrophils within vessels (red arrow, upper right panel, red circle on the lower left panel) expressed high amounts of PCNA as did neutrophils found in the epithelium (red circle on lower right panel). This strong PCNA expression in neutrophil cytosol contrasts with the lack of labeling observed in cells present in the lamina propria, including fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Similar observations were made in lung explants from four CF patients. We recently identified coronin-1A (Grogan et al., 1997) as a cytosolic protein overexpressed in CF neutrophils, a finding that was consistent with its anti-apoptotic function (Moriceau et al., 2009). Coronin-1 expression investigated by immunohistochemistry of pulmonary tissues obtained from CF patients during transplantation clearly showed a strong coronin-1A expression in neutrophils at the site of inflammation (Moriceau et al., 2009). Similar immunohistochemistry labeling of PCNA in neutrophils within the airway lumen showed a great variation in their PCNA contents reflecting their different apoptosis rates (Figure 2C). In contrast, the cytoplasm of neutrophils present within the mucosa, lamina propria and vessels were strongly labeled thus indicating their survival state (Figure 2C). These observations suggest that PCNA was highly expressed in neutrophils infiltrating the lung of CF patients and might play a role in neutrophil survival at the site of inflammation. Whether PCNA could be associated to coronin-1A is currently unknown but should require more investigation. Investigation of cytosolic PCNA within neutrophils at sites of inflammation (for instance in vasculitis or rheumatoid arthritis) should also be explored. Strategies aiming at potentiating neutrophil apoptosis by targeting the PCNA scaffold in CF have to be carefully investigated and could be combined with other anti-inflammatory or anti-infectious therapeutic strategies to achieve a maximum efficacy in term of dampening neutrophil-driven inflammation. It might be possible to adjust this type of therapy to avoid any risk of neutropenia-induced infection.CONCLUSION Highlighting peculiar pathways used by neutrophils to control their survival (Geering and Simon, 2011) are of pivotal importance for the development of novel anti-inflammatory strategies (Duffin et al., 2010). Even in the absence of proliferation, PCNA seems to have a conservative function for preserving neutrophil’s life. This particular cytosolic PCNA localization strongly suggests that this could be harnessed for therapeutic purposes when neutrophils would be out of control such as in sustained inflammation. This will be our main challenge to exploit all the data on nuclear PCNA gathered during more than five decades of work, and try to be creative to understand how the enigmatic PCNA scaffold participates to neutrophil survival.Conflict of Interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Background The toxin arsenic in soil and aqueous environments is considered as one of the prominent environmental causes of cancer mortality in the World, especially in Bangladesh, India and China. In recent years, chronic intake of groundwater with high levels of arsenic has caused endemic arsenicosis in several provinces of China and new cases of arsenicosis are continuously emerging [1]. Developing efficient and environment-friendly technologies to remove arsenic from soil and water systems is of great importance to many countries including China. Bioremediation of heavy or toxic metal contaminated sites has been often shown to be more efficient than chemical and physical methods, especially when stimulating indigenous microbial communities [2]. Bacteria have developed different strategies to transform arsenic including arsenite oxidation, cytoplasmic arsenate reduction, respiratory arsenate reduction, and arsenite methylation [3]. The primary role of some of these transformations is to cope with arsenic toxicity. Arsenite-oxidizing bacteria oxidize arsenite [As(III)] to arsenate [As(V)] which in many cases is considered primarily a detoxification metabolism since As(V) is much less toxic than As(III). In addition, As(V) is negatively charged and can be easily adsorbed, thus such bacteria have been used in batch reactors together with immobilizing material for removing arsenic from waste water [4,5]. As(III) oxidation has been identified in various bacteria including Pseudomonas [6], Alcaligenes [7], Thiomonas [8], Herminiimonas [9], Agrobacterium [10], and Thermus [11]. Some of these bacteria were able to use As(III) as the sole electron donor and grew as lithotrophs. However, characterized heterotrophic arsenite-oxidizing bacteria have not been shown to gain energy through arsenite oxidation and probably use As(III) oxidation as a detoxification mechanism. Arsenite oxidation was catalyzed by a periplasmic arsenite oxidase. This enzyme contains two subunits encoded by the genes aoxA/aroB/asoB (small Fe-S Rieske subunit) and aoxB/aroA/asoA (large Mo-pterin subunit) respectively [12-14]. Recently aoxB-like sequences have been widely found in different arsenic contaminated soil and water systems [15]. Two families of arsenite transport proteins responsible for As(III) extrusion, ArsB and Acr3p, have been shown to confer arsenic resistance [12,16,17]. The founding member of the ArsB family, ArsB from E. coli, has been extensively characterized and shown to be a 45 kDa, inner membrane protein with 12 transmembrane helices [18,19]. Either ArsB alone or in association with ArsA catalyzes the extrusion of arsenite and antimonite from cells [20]. In most cases, arsB is co-transcribed with arsC encoding an arsenate reductase. It has been suggested that evolution and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of both the ArsB and the ArsC family may have happened simultaneously in microbial evolution [12]. In many cases, As(III) is taken up by aquaglyceroporins [21] and extruded by ArsB [22]. Members of Acr3p transporters showed a function similar to ArsB, but the two proteins have no significant sequence similarity. Even though Acr3p is much less characterized, it has been reported to be present in more phylogenetically distant species than ArsB. Acr3p could be divided into two subfamilies, Acr3(1)p and Acr3(2)p, based on their phylogenetic dissimilarities [16,23]. Acr3p appeared to be more specific and transported only arsenite but not antimonite [24,25], except that Acr3p of Synechocystis was able to transport both arsenite and antimonite [26]. The arsenite transporter gene arsB, ACR3(1) and ACR3(2) have been identified in various soil bacteria [16]. However, a correlation between genotype and arsenite resistance level has not been found yet. The impact of microbial arsenite oxidation and arsenate reduction were reported to influence environmental arsenic cycles [27]. Understanding the diversity and distribution of indigenous bacterial species in arsenic-contaminated sites could be important for improvement of arsenic bioremediation. Microbial species with arsenic biotransforming capabilities had so far not been evaluated in soil systems in China. The objectives of this study were: (1) Study the distribution and diversity of arsenite-resistant and arsenite-oxidizing bacteria in soils with different arsenic-contaminated levels; (2) Investigation of the different arsenite oxidase and arsenite transporter genes and attempt to correlate their presence to the arsenic resistance level of these bacteria.ResultsDistribution and diversity of arsenite-resistant bacteria in soils with different levels of arsenic Analysis of microbial species and diversity of arsenite-resistant bacteria were performed in 4 soil samples with high (TS), intermediate (SY) and low (LY and YC) levels of arsenic contamination. A total of 230 arsenite-resistant bacteria were obtained and 14 of them showed arsenite oxidizing abilities. Based on analyses of colony morphologies and 16S rDNA-RFLP, a total of 58 strains were obtained including 5 arsenite-oxidizing bacteria. Nearly full-length 16S rDNA sequences were used for bacterial identification. Among the analyzed 58 strains, 20 showed 100% nucleotide identities, 33 had 99% identities, 3 (Acinetobacter sp. TS42, Janthinobacterium sp. TS3, and Delftia sp. TS40) had 98% identities and 2 (Acinetobacter sp. TS11, and Acinetobacter sp. TS39) had 97% identities to sequences deposited in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis divided the 58 strains into 23 genera belonging to 5 major bacterial lineages: α-Proteobacteria (5 strains, 2 genera), β-Proteobacteria (15 strains, 6 genera), γ-Proteobacteria (22 strains, 6 genera), Firmicutes (5 strains, 2 genera) and Actinobacteria (11 strains, 7 genera) (Fig. 1).Figure 1 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree, MICs, and related genes. 16S rRNA gene (~1400 bp) phylogenetic analysis, MICs, and related genes of arsenite-resistant bacteria identified in soils with high (TS), intermediate (SY) and low (LY/YC) levels of arsenic contamination. Sequences in this study are in bold type and bootstrap values over 50% are shown. The scale bar 0.02 indicates 2% nucleotide sequence substitution. Among the 58 strains, 45 were isolated from the highly arsenic-contaminated soil (TS1-TS45), 8 were from the intermediate arsenic-contaminated soil (SY1-SY8) and 5 from the low arsenic-contaminated soils (LY1-LY4 and YC1) (Fig. 1). Acinetobacter, Delftia, Arthrobacter, Microbacterium, Aeromonas, Acidovorax, Ensifer, Janibacter, Janthinobacterium, Klebsiella, Kocuria, Micrococcus, Shewanella and Thauera were identified from the highly arsenic-contaminated TS soil only. Achromobacter and Williamsia were specific for the SY site. Exiguobacterium particularly existed in the LY/YC sites. Comamonas, Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas were identified from both the TS and SY sites. Agrobacterium, Rhodococcus and Bacillus were identified from both the TS and LY/YC sites. Acinetobacter, Comamonas, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Delftia, Agrobacterium and Bacillus were the major arsenite-resistant bacteria in all the analyzed soil samples (37/58 = 64%).Arsenite-oxidizing bacteria were phylogentically distant Five arsenite-oxidizing bacteria were identified including Achromobacter sp. SY8 (β-Proteobacteria), Agrobacterium spp. TS43, TS45, LY4 (α-Proteobacteria), and Pseudomonas sp. TS44 (γ-Proteobacteria) (Fig. 1, square black mark). All of them were heterotrophic since they could not use CO2 as the sole carbon source and also could not grow with arsenite as the sole electron donor (data not shown). The 16S rDNA identities of these strains were analysed and compared to the following related arsenite-oxidizing bacteria. Achromobacter sp. SY8 shared 98% 16S rDNA identity to Achromobacter sp. NT10 (GenBank accession no. AY027500) [28]. Agrobacterium spp. TS43, TS45, LY4 showed 99%, 98% and 99% 16S rDNA identities to Agrobacterium sp. 5A (GenBank accession no. AF388033) [29] respectively. The 16S rDNA identity between Pseudomonas sp. TS44 and Pseudomonas putida strain OS-5 was 97% (GenBank accession no. AY952321) [30].Arsenite resistance levels of arsenite-resistant bacteria vary greatly The MIC range for arsenite of the 58 strains was from 2 mM to 34 mM (Fig. 1). The numbers of the strains with MIC values ≥ 2 mM, ≥ 5 mM, ≥10 mM, ≥15 mM, ≥ 20 mM, ≥ 25 mM and ≥ 30 mM were 58, 48, 33, 25, 17, 5 and 2 respectively. Certain correlations were found between the arsenite resistance levels, the bacterial species and soils with different arsenic-contaminated levels: (i) All of the 5 strains belonging to Firmicutes showed a very low MICs [Bacillus spp. TS2 (3 mM), TS27 (5 mM), YC1 (3 mM), LY2 (3 mM) and Exiguobacterium sp. LY3 (3 mM)]; (ii) Among the strains belonging to Pseudomonas or Agrobacterium, the MICs of arsenite oxidizers were higher than the non-arsenite oxidizers [Pseudomonas sp. TS44 (23 mM) vs Pseudomonas spp. TS5 (9 mM), TS9 (6 mM), SY4 (5 mM), SY6 (3 mM), SY7 (7 mM); Agrobacterium spp. TS43 (25 mM), TS45 (20 mM), LY4 (20 mM) vs Agrobacterium sp. TS8 (8 mM)]; (iii) The average MIC of the 5 arsenite oxidizers (20 mM) was higher than the 53 non-arsenite oxidizers (12 mM); (iv) A total of 12 highly arsenite-resistant bacteria [Acinetobacter spp. TS6, TS14, TS23 and TS42, Arthrobacter sp. TS22, Comamonas spp. TS37 and TS38, Rhodococcus sp. TS21, Stenotrophomonas spp. TS15 and TS23 and 2 arsenite oxidizers (Agrobacterium sp. TS43 and Pseudomonas sp. TS44)] whose MICs exceeded 20 mM were only obtained from highly arsenic-contaminated TS soil; (v) Only intermediate (10 mM < MICs ≤ 20 mM) and low (MICs ≤ 10 mM) MIC levels of arsenite-resistant bacteria were identified from the intermediate and low arsenic-contaminated soils; (vi) Strains of the highly arsenic-contaminated TS site had higher arsenite resistance levels (average MIC = 14 mM) than the strains of the intermediate (average MIC = 11 mM) and low arsenic soils (average MIC = 8 mM).Identification and distribution of the arsenite oxidase gene aoxB and arsenite transporter genes arsB, ACR3(1) and ACR3(2) A total of 5 arsenite oxidase genes and 51 arsenite transporter genes were successfully amplified from 38 strains using PCR with degenerate primers. The ACR3(1) and ACR3(2) were amplified in strains of the high and intermediate arsenic-contaminated soils only. In contrast, aoxB and arsB were found in strains isolated from all three kinds of arsenic-contaminated environments (Fig. 1). Strains containing both an arsenite oxidase gene (aoxB) and an arsenite transporter gene (ACR3 or arsB) showed a higher average arsenite resistance level than the strains possessing arsenite transporter genes only [aoxB/ACR3 (20.25 mM) ≈ aoxB/arsB (20 mM) > arsB/ACR3 (14.29 mM) ≈ ACR3 (14.13 mM) > arsB (10.1 mM)]. The aoxB sequences were amplified from all of the five arsenite oxidizers. No aoxB sequences were amplified from any of the 53 non-arsenite oxidizers. The deduced amino acid sequence of aoxB from Achromobacter sp. SY8 showed 95% identity to AoxB from Achromobacter sp. NT-10 (GenBank accession no. ABD72610) [15]. The deduced AoxBs from Agrobacterium spp. TS43, TS45, and LY4 displayed 95%, 96%, and 95% identities to AoxB of Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A (GenBank accession no. ABB51928) [31], and 94%, 96%, and 95% identities to AoxB from Rhizobium sp. NT26 (GenBank accession no. AAR05656) [14] respectively. The identity of AoxBs between Pseudomonas sp. TS44 and Alcaligenes faecalis NCIB 8687 was only 61% (Fig. 2). Comparison between 16S rDNA and deduced AoxB phylogenetic trees indicated that their evolutionary relationship was similar.Figure 2 Phylogenetic tree of arsenite oxidase (AoxB). Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences (~160 aa) of aoxB genes. Sequences in this study are in bold type and bootstrap values over 50% are shown. The scale bar 0.05 means 5% aa sequence substitution. Analyses of arsenite transporter genes using the BlastX algorithm showed proteins with 71%–80% aa identities that contained 2 ArsB and 6 Acr3(2)p, 81%–90% aa identities had 10 ArsB, 5 Acr3(1)p and 11 Acr3(2)p, aa identities over 90% included 6 ArsB, 7 Acr3(1)p and 4 Acr3(2)p. The arsB, ACR3(1), and ACR3(2) were amplified from both the arsenite oxidizers and non-arsenite oxidizers. The strains containing 2 arsenite transporter genes simultaneously were Pseudomonas sp. SY7 [arsB and ACR3(1)], Shewanella sp. TS29, Delftia spp. TS12, TS30, TS33, TS41 and Pseudomonas sp. SY4 [arsB and ACR3(2)], Stenotrophomonas spp. TS28, SY1, SY2, Aeromonas spp. TS26, TS36 and Pseudomonas sp. TS44 [ACR3(1) and ACR3(2)] (Fig. 1). Phylogenetic analysis of ArsB, Acr3(1)p and Acr3(2)p showed a clear separation of the Acr3p and ArsB clusters (Fig. 3). The Acr3p cluster was further divided into two phylogenetic groups, Acr3(1)p and Acr3(2)p. The ArsB cluster was formed by 18 sequences from β-, γ-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes; The Acr3(1)p group had 12 sequences from γ-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria; The Acr3(2)p group contained 21 sequences from α-, β-, and γ-Proteobacteria (Fig. 3).Figure 3 Phylogenetic tree of arsenite transporters [ArsB/Acr3(1)p/Acr3(2)p]. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences (~230 aa) of arsB/ACR3(1)/ACR3(2)genes. Filled triangles, potential horizontally transferred arsenite transporter genes. Sequences in this study are in bold type and bootstrap values over 50% are shown. The scale bar 0.1 shows 10% aa sequence substitution.Horizontal transfer of arsenite transporter genes may have occurred with ACR3(2) and arsB The arsenite oxidase gene aoxB appeared to be vertically transferred when comparing the phylogeny of 16S rRNA genes with those encoding aoxB. In contrast, certain inconsistency occurred when comparing phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA genes and arsenite transporter genes. Phylogenetic discrepancies could be detected in 8 ACR3(2) and 1 arsB (Fig. 4): (i) Aeromonas spp. TS26, TS36 belonging to γ-Proteobacteria based on 16S rDNA analysis were assigned to the β-Proteobacteria based on Acr3p(2) sequences; (ii) Stenotrophomonas spp. TS28, SY2, SY1 belonging to γ-Proteobacteria using 16S rDNA analysis were assigned to α-Proteobacteria based on Acr3p(2) sequences; (iii) Comamonas sp. TS32, TS35 and Delftia sp. TS33 were shown to belong to β-Proteobacteria, but were assigned to the γ-Proteobacteria clade using Acr3(2)p sequences; (iv) LY4 belonged to α-Proteobacteria based on the 16S rRNA gene, but its ArsB was in γ-Proteobacteria clade (Fig. 4). The phylogenetic discrepancies exhibited that these 9 arsenite transporter genes were probably acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Furthermore, 6 of these horizontally transferred ACR3(2) genes were from the strains isolated from the highly arsenic-contaminated TS soil.Figure 4 Phylogenetic evidence of potential HGT of arsB/ACR3(2). Phylogenetic comparison between 16S rRNA genes (A) and potential horizontally transferred arsB/ACR3(2) genes (B). All sequences used in A's and B's construction are subsets of Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 respectively.Discussion The first goal of this study was to determine the distribution and diversity of arsenite-resistant bacteria from soils with different levels of arsenic contamination. In addition, the ability to oxidize arsenite was further analyzed. Since the soils were collected from the surface and subsurface zones, only aerobic conditions were used in bacterial isolation. Thus, only aerobic/facultative aerobic bacteria were obtained in this study. We identified Acinetobacter, Comamonas, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Delftia, Agrobacterium, and Bacillus as the major genera of arsenite-resistant bacteria in the four arsenic-contaminated soils. Among them, Acinetobacter, Agrobacterium, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas species were commonly found at other arsenic-contaminated sites [16,29,30,32-35]. To our knowledge, Janibacter, Micrococcus, Thauera, and Williamsia were novel arsenite-resistant bacteria isolated in this study. We found that the high arsenic TS site revealed a much higher diversity of arsenite-resistant bacteria and the resistance levels observed were also much higher than in isolates found in the intermediate and low arsenic-contaminated sites. It is a limitation that only one medium (CDM) was used for bacterial isolation which could result in the observed differences between sites. The 12 strains with arsenite MICs > 20 mM were all obtained from the high arsenic soil. Generally, it has been proposed that high arsenic contamination is likely to exert a strong selective pressure leading to low microbial diversity [16,32]. However, the TS site used in our study had several hundred years of smelting history [36] which may result in the evolution of more bacterial species that were already well adapted at elevated arsenic concentrations. Moreover, Pennanen et al. [37] reported that at long-term field sites, soil microbial communities have had time to adapt to metal and/or metalloid stress. Turpeinen et al. [33] also found that the diversity of arsenic-resistant bacteria in higher arsenic-, chromium- and copper-contaminated soil was higher than that in less contaminated soil. These results suggested that microorganisms had been adapted to high arsenic stress and maintained their diversity in TS site after a long-term exposure to arsenic. The aoxB genes were detected in all of the five arsenite oxidizers but not in the non-arsenite oxidizers. This indicates that aoxB may be specific for most of the aerobic arsenite-oxidizing bacteria and useful for detecting arsenite-oxidizing microorganisms in the environment. Inskeep et al. [15] reported that arsenite oxidase genes are widely present in different arsenite oxidizers and widespread in soil-water systems. We have enriched pristine soils with arsenite to isolate arsenite-oxidizing bacteria from non-contaminated soils but without success. To our knowledge, all of the cultured arsenite oxidizers obtained so far were isolated from arsenic-contaminated sites. Inskeep et al. [15] detected aoxB-like sequences from arsenic-contaminated environments but not from pristine soils indicating that arsenite oxidation is a major process in arsenic-contaminated environments. The expression level of aoxB could probably be applied to monitor environmental arsenic-contaminated levels. A phylogenetic analysis of the 5 arsenite oxidizers based on the 16S rRNA genes and the aoxB genes showed a similar phylogeny indicating genomic stability of the aoxB genes. The MICs of the arsenite oxidizers displayed a maximal arsenite resistance level in both Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium. Furthermore, strains containing both the arsenite oxidase and any type of transporter gene showed a higher arsenite resistance level. These results suggest that bacteria capable of both arsenite oxidation and arsenite efflux mechanisms have an elevated arsenite resistance level. We also found that arsenite can be fully oxidized even at concentrations close to the MIC in arsenite oxidizers SY8 and TS44 (data not shown). Recently, we have amplified and sequenced the arsC/ACR3 operon (arsC1-arsR-arsC2-ACR3-arsH) in the adjacent downstream region of aoxB in Pseudomonas. sp. TS44 (data not shown; GenBank, EU311944). Kashyap et al. [31] found that in Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain 5A, disruption of aoxR caused a loss in the ability to oxidize arsenite and furthermore resulted in an apparent reducing phenotype probably due to the action of cytosolic ArsC and subsequent pumping out of As(III). It is noteworthy to point out that there are two processes of As(V) reduction in the environment. One is the use of As(V) as a terminal electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions. The other is the intracellular reduction of As(V) to As(III) under aerobic conditions due to the ArsC-dependent cytoplasmic arsenate reduction as part of the arsenic resistance system (ars operon). Since As(III) is the species being pumped out of cell (by arsB or ACR3), the presence of As(III) in the environments can also be detected under aerobic condition. One of the main purposes in this research was to determine the correlation among the bacterial arsenite resistance level, bacterial distribution in the environment and the different types of arsenite transporter gene families. We found that the ACR3 genotypes were predominant over arsB (33 ACR3 vs. 18 arsB) in our samples which was in agreement with a report by Achour et al. [16]. In addition, we found any two types of arsenite transporter genes can coexist in the same strain [arsB and ACR3(1), arsB and ACR3(2), ACR3(1) and ACR3(2)]. Related reports also found the presence of multiple sets of arsenic resistance genes and operons in one strain, especially the arsenite transporter genes. Pseudomonas putida KT2440 contains two operon clusters (arsRBCH) for arsenic resistance [38]. Acidithiobacillus caldus has three sets of arsenic resistance determinants, one located on the chromosome and the other two exist on the transposon [39,40]. Corynebacterium glutamicum has two typical arsenic-resistant operons and additional arsB and arsC genes, of which two arsenite transporter genes belonged to the ACR3(1) group [41]. The genome of Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans revealed the presence of four arsenic resistance operons including two arsB genes and one ACR3 [42]. Multiple sets of arsenic resistance determinants were also reported in B. subtilis [18] and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G20 [43]. These findings indicate that microorganisms have acquired multiple resistance determinants via chromosomal duplication or horizontal gene transfer to cope with arsenic toxicity. In this study, ACR3(1) and ACR3(2) appeared to be mostly associated with high arsenite resistance since they were only identified from the high and intermediate arsenic-contaminated sites, while arsB was found in all three sites. One explanation is that ACR3 may have a higher affinity and velocity to extrude arsenite than arsB and thus seems to be more effective. Heavy metal contaminated environments were shown to provide a strong selective pressure for transfer of related resistance genes within soil systems [44]. In this study, aoxB and ACR3(1) appeared to be more stable than ACR3(2) and arsB since phylogenetic discrepancies between 16S rRNA genes and ACR3(2)/arsB were found which supported HGT events of ACR3(2) and arsB. Most of the HGT occurred in strains identified from the highly arsenic-contaminated TS soil [6 ACR3(2)]. This indicates that arsenite transporter genes may be horizontally transferred and increasingly present in a microbial population under conditions of long-term elevated arsenic stress. It is important to note that HGT occurred in somewhat closely related species in this study, however, this does not detract from the suggestion of HGT and it is likely that the HGT events occurred between these closely related species. Martinez et al. [45] reported that PIB-Type ATPases (pbrA/cadA/zntA) were broadly transferred in Arthrobacter and Bacillus in radionuclide and metal contaminated soils. Jackson and Dugas [46] also suggested that horizontally transferred arsC resulted in the diversities and complexities of arsenate reductase during its evolution. Excluding arsC, other genes related to arsenic resistance (e.g. arsA, arsB/ACR3) had not been reported as being transferred by HGT. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report widespread horizontal transfer of arsenite transporter genes. The HGT event and subsequent maintenance may have occurred increasingly under the high arsenic pressure [47] and resulted in plastic changes in microbial diversity.Conclusion This work investigates the distribution and diversity of microbial arsenite-resistant species in soils representing three different levels of arsenic contamination, and further studies the arsenite resistance and arsenic transforming genes of these species. Our research provides valuable information of microbial species and genes responsible for arsenite oxidation and resistance, and increases knowledge of the diversity and distribution of the indigenous bacteria that may be stimulated for successful bioremediation of arsenic contamination.MethodsSite description and soil sample collection Four soil samples representing high (TS), intermediate (SY) and low (LY/YC) levels of arsenic contamination were used in this study. The TS soil was collected in Tieshan District, a highly arsenic-contaminated region, which is located in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, central China. There are several kinds of metal (gold, copper, iron) mines that have been smelted for many years. Concentrations of arsenic and heavy metals are extremely high in water, soil and sediments of this area [36]. The SY soil was collected from a pig farm, Shayang County, Jingmen City, Hubei Province where there are certain levels of arsenic in the soil due to the long-term usage of arsenic in feed material to resist disease and stimulate pig growth. The other two samples, LY and YC, were collected from the low arsenic-contaminated soils near the Yellow Sea of Lianyungang and Yancheng Cities Jiangsu Province, eastern China, respectively. Several soil samples from each site were collected from the surface horizon (0–15 cm), stored at 4°C and mixed together for bacterial isolation. The total arsenic concentrations of the four soils (determined by atomic absorption spectrometry) were 337.2 mg kg-1 (183.4–882.2 mg kg-1, SD = 184.58), 72.1 mg kg-1 (43.4–94.6 mg kg-1, SD = 18.31), 24.1 mg kg-1 (15.7–40.1, mg kg-1, SD = 8.24) and 34.6 mg kg-1 (22.0–48.8 mg kg-1, SD = 8.96) for TS, SY, LY and YC, respectively.Isolation and identification of arsenite-resistant and arsenite-oxidizing bacteria One hundred grams of each soil sample was amended with NaAsO2 to a final concentration of 500 mg kg-1 and incubated at 28°C for a week. During incubation sterilized H2O was added to the jars to reach the original moisture value. Isolation of arsenite-resistant bacteria was performed by adding 10 g (triplicates) of each soil to 90 mL 0.85% NaCl in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and shaken at 160 rpm for 30 min. 1 mL of the above mixture was added to 9 mL 0.85% NaCl for serial dilution and plated on chemically defined medium (CDM) plates [9] with a final concentration of 800 μM NaAsO2 and incubated at 28°C for another week. Single colonies were picked and restreaked several times to obtain pure isolates. The obtained arsenite-resistant bacteria were tested for their abilities to oxidize As(III) (NaAsO2) using a qualitative KMnO4 screening method [10]. Each arsenite-resistant bacterium was inoculated in CDM broth with a final concentration of 800 μM NaAsO2 and then shaken at 160 rpm for 5 days at 28°C. For each isolate 1 mL culture was added to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube containing 30 μL of 0.01 M KMnO4 and the color change of KMnO4 was monitored. A pink color of the mixture indicated a positive arsenite oxidation reaction [formation of As(V)]. The sterile CDM medium containing the same amount of NaAsO2 was used as an abiotic control. The arsenite oxidizing phenotype was also detected using the molybdene blue method with a spectrophotometer (DU800, BeckMan, CA, USA) [48]. Total DNA of each strain was extracted using standard molecular genetic methods. Nearly full-length 16S rDNA of the bacteria was amplified by PCR using universal primers Uni-27F and Uni-1492R (Table 1) [49]. PCR amplification was performed in an ATC 201 Thermal Cycler (Apollo, San Diego, CA, USA) in a 50 μL volume containing 10–50 ng DNA, 1 ng μL-1 of each primer, 200 μM of each dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 μL dimethyl sulfoxide, 5 μL of 10 × PCR buffer [100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 100 mM KCl] and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA), and adding ddH2O to a final volume of 50 μL. The PCR program consisted of an initial 5 min denaturation step at 94°C; 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 50°C, 1.5 min at 72°C; and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min.Table 1 Primers used in this studyPrimerSequenceReferenceUni-27F5'-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3'Uni-1492R5'-GGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3'49Primers #1F5'-GTSGGBTGYGGMTAYCABGYCTA-3'Primers #1R5'-TTGTASGCBGGNCGRTTRTGRAT-3'15darsB1F5'-GGTGTGGAACATCGTCTGGAAYGCNAC-3'darsB1R5'-CAGGCCGTACACCACCAGRTACATNCC-3'16dacr1F5'-GCCATCGGCCTGATCGTNATGATGTAYCC-3'dacr1R5'-CGGCGATGGCCAGCTCYAAYTTYTT-3'16dacr5F5'-TGATCTGGGTCATGATCTTCCCVATGMTGVT-3'dacr4R5'-CGGCCACGGCCAGYTCRAARAARTT-3'16 B = G, T or C; M = A or C; N = A, C, G, or T; R = A or G; S = G or C; V = A, C, or G; Y = C or T. Colony morphologies and 16S rDNA PCR-RFLP technique were used to remove the repeated isolates for each sample. PCR-RFLP was performed by enzyme digestion at 37°C for 3 hrs in a 20 μL volume containing 2 μL of 10 × enzyme buffer, 2.5 units of HaeIII or MspI and 5–10 μL of the 16S rDNA PCR products, amending ddH2O to a final volume of 20 μL. The digested DNA fragments were separated in 2% agarose gels and the digestion patterns were grouped by DNA fingerprinting profiles.Identification of the aoxB gene encoding the arsenite oxidase Mo-pterin subunit and arsB, ACR3(1) and ACR3(2) genes encoding different arsenite transport proteins The PCR amplification of aoxB was performed using degenerate primers (Primers #1F and #1R) (Table 1) and following the PCR conditions as described by Inskeep et al. [15]. The amplification of arsB, ACR3(1) and ACR3(2) genes were performed using three pairs of degenerate primers [darsB1F and darsB1R for arsB, dacr1F and dacr1R for ACR3(1), dacr5F and dacr4R for ACR3(2)] (Table 1) as described by Achour et al. [16]. The PCR products were purified using the Gel Extraction Kit (SBS Genetech, Shanghai, China). The purified PCR products were ligated into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and the ligation products were used to transform E. coli DH5α competent cells by electroporation. The transformants were grown on LB agar containing ampicillin, X-Gal and IPTG at 37°C for 16 hrs according to the manufacturer's recommendations.DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis The PCR products were purified using the UltraPure™ PCR Kit (SBS Genetech). DNA sequencing analysis was performed using ABI 3730XL DNA analyzer by Sunbiotech company (Beijing, China). All sequences were analyzed by BlastN (for 16S rRNA gene) and BlastX (for deduced AoxB and ArsB/Acr3p) searching tools [50]. All sequences were checked manually and edited for the same lengths using ClustalX 1.83 software [51]. MEGA 3.1 software [52] was used to construct phylogenetic trees by the neighbor-joining distance method [53] and reliability of inferred trees was tested with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Some reference sequences from the GenBank were used in constructing phylogenetic trees for clarification.Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of arsenite The MIC, defined as the lowest concentration of arsenite that inhibited growth in CDM broth, was performed with all arsenite-resistant bacteria. Triplicate samples of each single colony were inoculated in 3 mL CDM broth supplemented with increasing concentrations of NaAsO2, incubated with shaking at 28°C for one week and the OD600 values were determined.

However, the effect of zinc and copper in the pathogenesis of hair loss is still unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the zinc and copper status in each of four types of hair loss. A study was carried out with 30 health controls and 312 patients who were diagnosed with alopecia areata (AA), male pattern hair loss, female pattern hair loss and telogen effluvium (TE) (2008 to 2011; Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital). Zinc and copper serum concentrations were evaluated between controls and each of four types of hair loss patients. In all of the hair loss patients, the mean serum zinc was 84.33±22.88, significantly lower than the control group (97.94±21.05 µg/dl) (=0.002), whereas the serum copper was 96.44±22.62, which was not significantly different (=0.975). The analysis of each group showed that all groups of hair loss had statistically lower zinc concentration, but not copper concentrations. However, the ratio of the patients with serum zinc concentration lower than 70 µg/dl was significantly high in only the AA group (odds ratio, OR 4.02; confidence interval, CI 1.13 to 14.31) and the TE group (OR 1.12; CI 1.12 to 17.68). The data led to the hypothesis of zinc metabolism disturbances playing a key role in hair loss, especially AA and TE, whereas the effect of copper on hair growth and shedding cycles still needs more study.

INTRODUCTION Zinc and copper are essential micronutrients that play an important role in the metalloenzyme process of the body. Zinc is involved in protein and nucleic acid synthesis, and plays a role in various metabolic pathways and cellular functions, whereas copper is involved in thyrosinase and lysyl oxidase, playing a part in melanin synthesis and collagen cross-liking1. With regard to hair loss, zinc is a potent inhibitor of hair follicle regression, and accelerates hair follicle recovery2. More specifically, transient zinc deficiency is a major pathogenesis in acrodermatitis enteropathica, resulting in hair loss3. Arguments that zinc deficiency can be a disturbing factor for the growth of hair have been emerging since the 1990s4,5. There is also a contradicting argument that there exists no relationship between zinc and hair loss6. Even though a few studies have reported that zinc deficiency has correlations with alopecia areata (AA) and telogen effluvium (TE), no studies have mentioned the relation between zinc and androgenic alopecia so far7. Additionally, not many studies have been conducted on the relationship between copper and hair loss. Most studies have reported that a decreased concentration of copper was not observed in AA, although the relationship between copper and other types of hair loss was not studied at all5. Therefore, in this study, an attempt is made to investigate the deficiency of zinc and copper by hair loss type, and their relationship is examined.MATERIALS AND METHODSPatients and controls The study was carried out with outpatients visiting Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital (Seoul, Korea) for hair loss as their main complaint from 2008 to 2011. A total of 312 hair loss patients were enrolled in this study, and 32 normal people without any underlying disease or alopecia were selected as a control group. Those who have taken supplements containing zinc or copper for the past 6 months and those who have had treatment from other hospitals for hair loss as their main complaints were excluded from the patient and control groups. In order to find the serum zinc and copper concentration for different hair loss types, the patient group was divided into 4 groups: the AA group (group 1) was defined as a patient group with exclamation-point-hairs and circular hair loss patch, with no evidence of infection. The male pattern hair loss group (MPHL; group 2) was defined as a patient group with Hamilton-Norwood classification8 grade 2 and above. The female pattern hair loss group (FPHL; group 3) was defined as a patient group with Ludwig9 grade 1 and above. The TE group (group 4) was defined as a patient group who had mental or physical stress for the past 2 to 4 months and was positive in hair pull tests. The classification of patients was made by two dermatologists, and 10 patients who did not meet the criteria or who met two definitions simultaneously were excluded. Finally, the past medical history and present illnesses were recorded in detail for the 302 hair loss patients and 32 people in the normal control group. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital (KDIRB No.12-1-006).Biochemical analysis Venous blood was sampled before meals. The serum zinc and copper concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Elan DRC-e; PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).Statistical analysis The results were expressed as means±standard deviations. In order to compare the serum zinc and copper concentration of the 4 hair loss patient groups with those of the control group, the statistical significance among the groups was investigated by comparing the means using the Student's t-test. In addition, each group was divided into patients with normal blood concentration and patients with lower concentration than normal, and then compared with the control group. The ratios were examined for the statistical significance using Fisher's exact test. Furthermore, to identify the confounding variables, the correlation between zinc and copper concentration, and that between zinc, copper, and age were checked using Pearson's correlation. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant (IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0; IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA).RESULTS Ninety-four patients with AA (group 1) and 84 patients with MPHL (group 2) were identified, and 77 patients were diagnosed with FPHL (group 3) and 47 patients were diagnosed with TE (group 4). The mean ages of the patient group and control group were 36.61±13.81 and 33.50±10.50, respectively, and other demographic data are described in Table 1. In the normal control group, the mean serum zinc was 97.94±21.05 µg/dl, and the mean serum copper was 96.29±28.84 µg/dl. In all the hair loss patients, the mean serum zinc was 84.33±22.88, which was significantly lower than that of the control group (p=0.002), whereas the serum copper was 96.44±22.62, which was not significantly different (p=0.975). The hair loss patient groups and the control were individually compared. In each hair loss group, the serum zinc concentration was significantly lower than that of the control, but the serum copper concentration was not significantly different (Table 2). The hair loss patients were divided based on the lower normal limit of 70 µg/dl of zinc, and their ratios were compared with those of the control group. The analysis of each group showed that the ratio of the patients with serum zinc concentration lower than 70 µg/dl was significantly high in only the AA group (odds ratio [OR] 4.02; confidence interval [CI] 1.13 to 14.31) and TE group (OR 4.65; CI 1.12 to 17.68) (Table 3). The correlation analysis of zinc, copper, and age for all subjects showed that there was no correlation between zinc and copper (p=0.325), and the correlations between zinc and age and between copper and age were not statistically significant (zinc: p=0.083, copper: p=0.104).DISCUSSION As a cofactor of metalloenzyme, zinc is involved in almost every metabolism occurring in the body, and affects hair growth. It also plays an important functional role in hair follicle cycling2. A recent study revealed that copper plays a crucial role in the differentiation and proliferation of dermal papilla cells, which are specialized fibroblasts that play an important role in the development of hair follicles10. Even though zinc and copper are theoretically considered to play certain roles in the pathogenesis of hair loss, clinical research has shown opposing views on the relationship. In a recent study, AA patients whose serum zinc was lower than 70 µg/dl were administered zinc gluconate 50 mg every day for 12 weeks. The findings showed that the serum zinc concentration was elevated by 27.6 µg/dl on average, and 60% of the patients administered zinc showed a clinically therapeutic effect11. Another study examined the blood and urine samples of children with alopecia, and found that the zinc concentrations in blood and urine were lower than in the normal group12. However, another study found that even though there was a difference in serum zinc and copper concentrations between hair loss patients and normal individuals, there was no statistical significance. A similar study also found that there was no difference in zinc and copper, but the concentration of serum magnesium was quite higher13,14. Although it is likely that there is a close theoretical relationship between serum copper and hair loss, as with zinc, more studies have shown contradictory results. In a study conducted on Koreans consisting of a control group of 10 normal people and a group of 30 AA patients, the serum zinc concentration was significantly low in the patients group, but the serum copper concentration was a little higher in the patients group without any statistical significance5. In a study conducted in Indonesia that measured serum zinc, copper, and magnesium for 50 AA patients and 50 people in a normal control group, copper and magnesium levels did not show any significant differences, in contrast to the zinc levels4. However, there was a study that indicated the serum copper concentration in alopecia universalis was lower in the patient group13. The findings of this study indicate that the serum zinc concentration of the hair loss patients group was generally lower than that of the control group, and the serum copper concentration was not significantly different from that of the control group. The mean serum zinc concentration of the hair loss patients group was 84.33 µg/dl, which was lower than the normal group by 13 µg/dl, indicating a statistical difference from the control group. However, this value is within the range of the reference value of the measuring equipment (70 to 130 µg/dl), and is higher than the concentration of 70 µg/dl, at which zinc supplementation begins. The patients group was therefore divided into a group with low zinc concentration and a group with normal zinc concentration based on the lower normal limit of 70 µg/dl within each hair loss group. The ratios with the control group were then compared. From this comparison, it was statistically confirmed that there were more patients with low serum zinc in the AA group and TE group than in the normal group. This finding is similar to those of the studies mentioned earlier, where the zinc concentration was low in the AA groups6. Zinc and copper are absorbed in the small intestine by the specialized ZnT (zinc transporter) channel, as well as by a common divalent cationic transporter1,15,16. Therefore, it can be assumed that if the levels of either of the two are excessive, they can affect the serum concentration by competing with each other, which can lead to erroneous results. Accordingly, the correlation between serum copper and zinc was tested using Pearson's correlation, but no significant correlation was found. The correlation of zinc and copper with age was also tested, considering that the concentration of zinc and copper varies by age, but a statistical significance was not found, confirming that the variables are not confounding variables. The exact mechanism of how zinc affects hair loss has not been found so far, although zinc-related metalloenzymes may have the potential to regulate hair growth. Zinc is a component of zinc finger motifs for many transcription factors, which regulate hair growth through hedgehog signaling, and is a catagen inhibitor via its inhibitory action on apoptosis-related endonucleases17-19. Paus et al.20 reported that zinc is a potent dose-dependent immunomodulator of hair follicles. It is also a potent inhibitor of hair follicle regression and accelerates hair follicle recovery2. Therefore, zinc metalloenzymes may be necessary for hair growth rather than the components of hair itself. Many other studies have also verified the correlation between serum zinc concentration and hair loss4,11-14. Of the hair loss groups, the ratio of the patients with low serum zinc concentration was significantly lower in the AA and TE groups than in the control group. It seems that the serum zinc concentration of the two groups affected the pathogenesis characteristic of hair loss, which has a fast onset. In the FPHL and MPHL groups, the serum zinc concentration was lower than in the control group, but it was in the normal serum zinc range. In addition, the ratio of the patients with low serum zinc concentration was not statistically significant. This result can be attributed to the fact that the abrupt zinc deficiency in the AA and TE, where the onset is acute, affected the pathogenesis, in contrast to the pattern hair loss, which slowly develops by hormonal changes such as the aging process. Since the serum copper concentration did not show any significant difference in the value and the patient ratio with the control group in all 4 groups, it is considered that there is no direct relationship between serum copper concentration and hair loss, which is consistent with other studies. Further studies are needed4,6,11-14. The findings of this study are different from other studies, in that the hair loss types were divided into AA, MPHL, FPHL, and TE, and the serum zinc and copper concentrations of each type were compared with those of the control, rather than focusing on the entire hair loss group or a specific patient group. A literature review shows that no studies, excluding the ones with general hair loss or AA, have been conducted on the relationship of serum zinc and copper concentration with other types of hair loss, other than TE7,19. The issue of hair loss is an important part of the dermatology field, and it is gradually expanding its scope. Based on this research, it is recommended that the zinc concentration, rather than copper concentration, be measured, and that zinc be supplied if the concentration of zinc is low. Even though the present study did not attempt to measure the zinc and copper concentration in the hair itself, large-scale of studies on the zinc concentration of both serum and hair are needed for zinc supplementation in the future.

In addition, the findings from this study also suggest a new mode of action of AGP for promoting animal growth. Introduction One of the primary means that food animal producers seek to enhance growth performance is through the use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP). Typically, AGP are defined as subtherapeutic quantities of antibiotics that enhance weight gain and feed conversion ratio [1], [2]. Although this is a long-established technique with benefits to production that are still evident, concern has increased over the last several decades because AGP exert selection pressures for the emergence and persistence of drug-resistant bacteria that threaten food safety and public health [1], [3]. Consequently, groups such as the World Health Organization have strongly urged proactive limitation on AGP use whereas others have banned them outright, as the European Union did in 2006 [1]. Recent suggestions by the Food and Drug Administration also support phasing out antimicrobials used for growth promotion in food animals [4]. Clearly there is an impetus to discontinue AGP use as an agricultural practice, but concerns regarding animal welfare and economic feasibility remain a concern. For this reason, AGP alternatives which could offset such negative impacts must be investigated. Targeting the mechanism of how AGP exert their growth promoting effects is a central focus when considering what alternative strategy may be an adequate substitute. Although there is no one all-encompassing means by which AGP improve animal performance, the general scientific consensus is that AGP mediate enhanced growth performance by altering intestinal microbiota. Recent studies using poultry and swine have helped us to understand the relationships between AGP supplementation and gastrointestinal bacterial composition [5]–[13]. The results of such studies prove that AGP create bacterial shifts and alter the microbial diversity of the intestine, suggesting that certain populations may be more related to animal growth than others. Although the definitive gut microbial community required for AGP-mediated optimal growth promotion is still largely unknown, previous studies have shown that the ability of AGP to promote growth is highly correlated with a decrease in activity of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) [14]–[16]. BSH is an enzyme produced by commensal bacteria in the intestine whose main function is to convert conjugated bile salts into unconjugated bile salts [17]. Unconjugated bile acids are amphipathic and able to solubilize lipids for micelle formation; however, when the amide bond is hydrolyzed by BSH, the resulting unconjugated form is much less efficient at doing so. Consistent with this finding, independent chicken studies have demonstrated that AGP usage significantly reduced population of Lactobacillus species, the major BSH-producers in the chicken intestine; in particular, L. salivarius, the dominant lactic acid bacterium present in the chicken intestine, was reduced in response to AGP treatment [5], [7], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Thus, AGP may promote animal growth by reducing the activity of BSH, an enzyme exerting negative impact on host fat digestion and utilization. Based on these findings, inhibition of BSH activity using specific inhibitors is likely a promising approach to improve growth performance of food animals. This hypothesis is supported by our recent study [20] in which a BSH enzyme with broad substrate specificity from a chicken L. salivarius strain [21] was identified and used for evaluating a panel of dietary compounds. In this study [20], discovery of copper and zinc compounds as potent BSH inhibitors offered a potential explanation as to why adding high concentrations of dietary copper and zinc can improve growth performance and feed efficiency of poultry [22]–[25] and swine [26]–[29]. To further test our hypothesis and develop alternatives to AGP, a significant technical hurdle is to identify potent, safe, and cost-effective BSH inhibitors. Modern computational approaches, such as homology modeling and molecular docking, would be helpful for this purpose. However, success of such structure-based computations in the discovery of BSH inhibitor relies on the availability of the defined structures of major BSH enzymes, which is still lacking at present. Since hydrolysis of soluble unconjugated bile salts by BSH generates insoluble unconjugated bile salts that could form significant precipitations [17], we took advantage of this unique hydrolysis feature and developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) method to rapidly and efficiently identify BSH inhibitors in this study. Subsequently, a pilot HTS using a diverse compound library identified several promising BSH inhibitors with potential as alternatives to AGP. Notably, the findings from our HTS and quantitative BSH assay also suggest a new mode of action of AGP; specifically, some AGP (e.g. tetracyclines and roxarsone) can directly inhibit intestinal BSH, likely leading to enhanced lipid metabolism and growth performance.Materials and MethodsPurification of Recombinant BSH (rBSH) The rBSH used in this study was purified from an E. coli construct that produces His-tagged BSH with broad substrate specificity from a chicken L. salivarius [20]. Expression of the His-tagged rBSH and purification by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+ -NTA) affinity chromatography was carried out as described in our previous publication [20], [30], [31].Standard BSH Activity Assay Determination of BSH activity was performed in microcentrifuge tube by following a two-step procedure to ascertain the amount of liberated amino acids from sodium glycocholate as detailed in our recent publication [20]. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The BSH activity was expressed as 1 µmol of amino acids liberated from the substrate per minute per mg of BSH. To determine inhibitory effect of a specific compound on the activity of BSH, the rBSH was incubated with or without specific compound for 30 min at 37°C prior to the addition of substrate sodium glycocholate. The standard BSH activity assay was performed to determine the residual activity. A final concentration of specific compound in a BSH activity assay was routinely 5 mM; if needed, specific compound was also serially diluted for dosing experiment. A control without compound added was set up in each independent experiment. All assays were performed in triplicate. Percentage inhibition was calculated by dividing the inhibited activity (mean activity of control – mean residual activity of presence of a compound) relative to the mean activity of control and then multiplied by 100.Development of Microplate Precipitation-based BSH Activity Assay In order to move towards creating a rapid method of screening for BSH inhibitors, a microtiter plate-based BSH activity assay was developed based on the publication by Tanaka et al. [32] with modifications. This is a precipitation-based assay that is based on the fact that hydrolysis of conjugated bile acid substrates will produce deconjugated bile acids which are insoluble at the reaction pH and can easily be visualized as a white precipitate (Fig. 1A).10.1371/journal.pone.0085344.g001Figure 1Optimization of conditions for high-throughput screening of BSH inhibitors. (A) Principal of the strategy for HTS screening of BSH inhibitors. (B) Proof of concept experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of the HTS methodology in 96-well plate. Using 200 µl of total reaction volume, BSH inhibitor was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mM in column 1 with 2-fold serial dilution through column 10. KIO3 is used as an example in duplicate rows. The purified BSH was added at final concentration of 8 µg/ml in column wells 1–11. Column 12 served as a negative control with no enzyme and BSH inhibitor added. For initial assays, 10 µl of rBSH (1 µg/µl) was added to the bottom of a clear 96-well microtiter plate with a round bottom. To this, 190 µl of reaction mix (178 µl of reaction buffer [0.1 M sodium-phosphate, pH 6.0], 10 µl of glycocholic acid [100 mM], and 2 µl of 1 M DTT) was added for a total reaction volume of 200 µl. Plates were incubated at 37°C for up to 6 hours. Precipitation of insoluble unconjugated bile salts was monitored every 30 minutes by visual observation concomitant to absorbance measurement at 600 nm (A600) using a microplate reader (model Multiskan EX; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vantaa, Finland). With this general assay procedure, different parameters were altered to determine the optimal assay conditions, which include the stock concentration of the rBSH (from 8 µg/µl to 0.027 µg/µl), pH of reaction buffer (6.0 or 6.5), incubation temperature (20°C, 37°C, or 40°C), conjugated bile salt substrate (glycocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taucholic acid, and taurodeoxycholic acid), and the final concentration of conjugated bile salt (ranging from 0 mM to 50 mM). After the assay conditions were optimized for the 200 µl reaction in a 96-well plate, a proof of concept assay was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of this procedure to screen compounds for BSH inhibition by using known BSH inhibitors that were previously determined [20]. The tested inhibitors include KIO3, NaIO4, NaIO3, CuCl2, and Na2SeO3. Before adding the reaction mix, 10 µl of inhibitor was added to the 10 µl of rBSH in the bottom of each well and mixed gently by pipetting. Inhibitors were added at a final concentration of 0.5 mM in column 1 with twofold serial dilutions through column 10 of the plate. As a control, two columns on each plate served as controls: a positive control with BSH and reaction mix only and a negative control with no BSH and inhibitor added. Assays were performed in duplicate. After all conditions were optimized, including use of inhibitors, the effectiveness and reproducibility of the microplate precipitation-based assay were further evaluated with the entire reaction scaled down to a 50 µl total volume with modification of the volume of specific component to meet the needs of HTS using 384-well microplate. For this purpose, an additional assay was performed using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the library compound solvent, as a control to rule out possible background noise caused by DMSO.High-throughput Screening of BSH Inhibitors High-throughput screening (HTS) of BSH inhibitors was performed in the HTS facility at the Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology (Nashville, TN). The library (2,240 compounds in 7 source plates from Spectrum) includes biologically active and structurally diverse compounds of known drugs, experimental bioactives, and pure natural products. All compounds tested have been dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. Briefly, 0.25 µl of a specific compound from the Spectrum Collection library was transferred into the bottom of a clear 384-well microplate (Greiner cat # 781182) with flat bottom by using the Echo 550/555 Liquid Handlers (Labcyte). Next, 12.5 µl of BSH (0.16 µg/µl prepared with reaction buffer) was added using the Multidrop Combi reagent dispenser (Thermo Scientific) and shaken for 5 minutes. Finally, 37.5 µl of reaction mix (32 µl of reaction buffer [0.1 M sodium-phosphate, pH 6.0], 2.5 µl of taurodeoxycholic acid [200 mM], and 0.5 µl of 1 M DTT) was added using the Multidrop Combi for a total reaction volume of 50 µl. The plates were subsequently shaken for 5 minutes to insure thorough mixing and spun to pull any reaction mixture back into the bottom of the well before incubation. Plates were incubated at 37°C with humidity and 5% CO2 and absorbance measured every hour at 600 nm (A600) for 4 hours using a SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices) with temperature controlled at 37°C; visual observations were concomitantly documented for precipitation. The reader on the system is connected via intranet to the facility’s network, enabling automated data acquisition, analysis, visualization, and archival using a powerful management and chemiinformatics tool, Accelrys Pipeline Pilot; all data are stored in an Oracle database. Each plate contained three controls manually added with a multichannel pipette in a predetermined pattern to the side wells. Control 1 consisted of BSH, DMSO solvent, and reaction mix; control 2 contained a known inhibitor, BSH, and reaction mix; control 3 contained DMSO and reaction mix only. Prior to screening the compound library, the above HTS protocol was validated twice in a full 384-well plate with checkerboard design containing activity controls (BSH, reaction mix containing substrate, and solvent DMSO) and inhibition controls (BSH, reaction mix containing substrate, and NaIO3).Selection and Validation of Identified BSH Inhibitors A preliminary list of BSH inhibitor hits was generated after the above HTS; the wells that were completely clear after 4 hours of incubation are deemed as hits. Extensive review of relevant material safety data sheet and literature were performed for the hits with emphasis on availability, stability, toxicity, cost, and environmental impact. The selected BSH inhibitor candidates were subjected to further in vitro validation using the 96-well microplate assay as well as the standard 2-step BSH assay as described above. The standard BSH assay is essential to confirm if the identified compounds are indeed real BSH inhibitors because we cannot completely rule out a possibility that certain compounds may cause less or no precipitation in reaction mix in a BSH activity-independent manner. The stock solutions of selected BSH inhibitors were purchased directly from the HTS facility at the Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology, which had been solubilized in DMSO; compounds were stored at −20°C after arrival. If needed, dosing experiment was further performed to evaluate the potency of specific inhibitor. Although the hit compounds belonging to an antibiotic family were not considered as potential alternatives to AGP, the following antibiotics were also chosen from the hit list and subjected to standard BSH assay to confirm if they had a direct inhibitory effect on BSH activity: cloxacillin sodium, cephradine, oxytetracycline, demeclocycline hydrochloride, and methacycline hydrochloride. In addition, following antibiotics that have been used as AGP were selected for evaluating their inhibitory effect on BSH activity using the standard 2-step BSH assay: doxycycline hydrochloride, roxarsone, tylosin, bacitracin, erythromycin, lincomycin, streptomycin, and sulfamethazine.ResultsOptimal Conditions for Microplate Precipitation-based BSH Activity Assay For initial assay in 96-well plate with final volume of 200 µl, rBSH concentration, reaction buffer pH, incubation temperature and length, substrate type and concentration were altered in separate assays for assessment. As expected, a pH of 6.0 and an incubation temperature of 37°C, both of which are used in the standard 2-step assay, were conducive to efficient BSH hydrolysis. An incubation length of 2 to 4 hours was targeted in order to get several progressive measurements during HTS to monitor the dynamics of precipitation development. Given that using large quantities of rBSH could cause the reaction to proceed too quickly, rBSH was serially diluted for the plate assay; it was determined that using 10 µl of rBSH at the concentration approximately 0.16 µg/µl elicited adequate hydrolysis of substrate with maximal precipitation occurring after 2 hours of incubation. Regarding the choice of substrate, taurodeoxycholic acid was better than other tested conjugated bile salts because it elicited most observable BSH activity response (generation of white precipitation), which was also able to be corroborated by measurements using a microplate reader (data not shown). With the above parameters optimized, a proof-of-concept experiment using known BSH inhibitors was performed. As shown in Fig. 1B, in the presence of high levels of a specific BSH inhibitor (KIO3), the activity of BSH was inhibited, which was reflected by displaying clear, transparent wells (columns 1–5). In the presence of low concentrations of the BSH inhibitor (columns 6–10) or in the absence of the BSH inhibitor (columns 11, Fig. 1B), the reaction mix became turbid due to the precipitation of unconjugated bile salts resulting from active BSH enzyme. Other selected BSH inhibitors also displayed similar pattern as shown in Fig. 1B (data not shown), demonstrating the feasibility of the optimized microplate precipitation-based methodology for discovery of BSH inhibitors using HTS. When the assay was further scaled down to a 50 µl total reaction volume, a prolonged incubation length (3–4 hours) was needed for precipitation to fully develop. DMSO, the solvent used for HTS library compounds, had little effect on precipitation formation with final concentration as high as 50 mM (data not shown).HTS Discovery of BSH Inhibitors At the HTS facility at the Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology, all assays were performed in 384-well plate with 50 µl total reaction volume. Prior to screening of the compound libraries, validation assays containing different controls were carried out to ensure the system was optimal for actual inhibitor screening and that the optimized conditions translated well to this HTS format. Notably, to ensure consistent and accurate delivery of rBSH into 384-well plate using dispenser, the optimized 50-ul reaction mix setting was further modified by using larger volume of diluted rBSH (12.5 µl rather than 2.5 µl) despite final concentration of rBSH in reaction mix unchanged. With this minor on-site modification, the results of validation assays indicated that the assay could clearly distinguish between wells with or without precipitation as a result of BSH hydrolysis. Both negative controls (no BSH) and those using BSH inhibitor (NaIO4 or KIO3) remained clear in stark contrast to positive controls (no inhibitor) that displayed obvious precipitation; the visual results were also consistent with spectrometer reading (data not shown). With the successful validation assays using HTS system, a pilot HTS using a 2,240-compound library was performed; plate setting was shown in Fig. 2A. A total of 7 plates were used for this screening, which led to 107 hits that were considered potent inhibitors. Hits were selected based on visual observation (the clear wells from lane 3 to lane 22 in a representative plate as shown in Fig. 2B) and corroborated via spectrophotometric measurement.10.1371/journal.pone.0085344.g002Figure 2Representative result of high-throughput screening of BSH inhibitors. (A) Plate layout for screening BSH inhibitors. Pink boxes (columns 3–22) indicate test wells that contain library compounds of interest, BSH, and reaction mix containing substrate. Library compounds were shot into the well bottom using Echo 550/555 and enzyme and reaction mix were added using Multidrop Combi. Controls were added manually to the side wells (columns 1–2 and 23–24): blue boxes indicate activity controls (BSH, reaction mix containing substrate, and solvent DMSO), yellow boxes correspond to inhibition controls (BSH, reaction mix containing substrate, and NaIO3), and white boxes are negative controls with no BSH added but include reaction mix as well as substrate. (B) The HTS results represented by one 384-well plate. Control wells indicate the assay proceeded normally. The wells in columns 3–22 that appeared clear, regardless of alternative color due to compound, and had low absorbance readings were considered hits (putative BSH inhibitors).Validation of Selected HTS Hits with Potential as Feed Additives Preliminary review of biochemical information of the corresponding hits eliminated most of compounds and identified 10 compounds that potentially could be used as feed additives for animal industry (Table 1). These 10 compounds were subjected to further validation using the plate assay as well as the 2-step activity assay to ascertain the quantitative inhibitory effect. The standard 2-step BSH activity assays identified two compounds as false positive (chrysophanol and folic acid); these two compounds also failed to inhibit BSH using 96-well plate assay.10.1371/journal.pone.0085344.t001Table 1Effect of selected HTS hits on BSH activitya.CompoundFormula (MW)% InhibitionCaffeic Acid PhenethylEster (CAPE)C17H16O4 (284.31)99.7RiboflavinbC17H20N4O6 (376.37)99.3Epicatechin monogallateC20H28O4 (332.44)98.6GossypetinC15H10O8 (318.24)97.3Carnosic AcidC20H28O4 (332.44)96.8MenadioneC11H8O2 (172.18)87.2PurpurogallinC11H8O5 (220.18)83.0TheaflavaninC20H16O8 (384.34)18.1ChrysophanolcC15H10O4 (254.24)3.7Folic AcidbC19H19N7O6 (441.40)−10.8 a Unless specified, the final concentration of compound in the reaction mix was 5 mM to achieve optimal resolution with the quantitative BSH activity assay. b The final concentration of riboflavin in reaction mix was 1 mM. c The final concentration of chrysophanol in reaction mix was 1.25 mM. d The final concentration of folic acid in reaction mix was 1.5 mM. Majority of the selected hits displayed potent inhibitory effect on BSH (Table 1). Notably, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), riboflavin, epicatechin monogallate, gossypetin, and carnosic acid consistently inhibited activity by over 95% in independent experiments (data not shown). In particular, despite its relative lower final concentration (1 mM) in reaction mix due to solubility issue, riboflavin still exerted strong inhibition on BSH activity (>99% of inhibition) (Table 1). Because we are particularly interested in CAPE and riboflavin as AGP alternatives, dosing experiments were conducted to examine if they could inhibit BSH activity at lower concentrations. CAPE still inhibited rBSH activity by more than 50% at a final concentration of 0.25 mM (Fig. 3A) and riboflavin by more than 50% at a final concentration as low as 0.00625 mM (Fig. 3B).10.1371/journal.pone.0085344.g003Figure 3Dosing effects of selected BSH inhibitors on BSH activity. (A) Inhibition of BSH activity by caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE). (B) Inhibition of BSH activity by riboflavin. All assays were performed in triplicate. The procedure is detailed in Materials and Methods.Direct Inhibitory Effect of Antibiotics on BSH Interestingly, a group of antibiotics were also HTS hits, including tetracycline and β-lactam antibiotics that have been widely used as AGP. This finding prompted us to speculate that direct inhibition of BSH activity by some antibiotics may be a new mode of action of AGP. To partly test this, we further examined a panel of antibiotics that have been used as AGP in food animals and determined if different classes of antibiotic make a difference in inhibition potential. As shown in Table 2, tetracycline antibiotics were consistently potent inhibitors. Additionally, roxarsone, an arsenical drug that has been extensively used in poultry production, also displayed high inhibitory effect on BSH activity. Both roxarsone and oxytetracycline inhibited BSH activity by over 95% when tested at a final concentration of 5 mM (Table 2). In an additional dosing experiment, oxytetracycline and roxarsone still inhibited enzyme activity by approximately 86% and 52%, respectively, at a final concentration of 0.625 mM (Fig. 4). Other tested antibiotics, such as β-lactam and lincosamide, displayed strong but relatively lower inhibitory effect on BSH activity (Table 2). However, the macrolide and bacitracin antibiotics had weak or no inhibitory effect on BSH.10.1371/journal.pone.0085344.g004Figure 4Dosing effects of oxytetracycline and roxarsone on BSH activity.

However, antibiotic resistance of zoonotic origin threatens the supply of food animals and public safety and, thus, is a compelling reason to discontinue their inclusion as feed additives. Likewise, elimination of dietary AGP will necessitate alternative strategies to compensate for setbacks to production, as have occurred in some areas where bans have been instituted [33]. Consequently, different products have been proposed as alternatives for AGP, including essential oils, prebiotics, probiotics, exogenous enzymes, and organic acids, among others, to change gut microbiota for enhanced animal health and growth performance [34]. However, very limited data is available to justify the choice of specific bacterial species or products for such microbiota manipulation despite the link between AGP induced growth promotion and altered gastrointestinal microflora [1], [2]. A promising strategy for developing AGP alternative is targeting general metabolic pathway that is influenced by AGP usage. Specifically, the activity of microbial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) in the intestine is a valid object for manipulation since studies repeatedly have observed that AGP use is associated with reduced BSH activity and improved animal growth performance [14]–[16]. Conjugated bile acids play a critical role in lipid solubilization and micelle formation and are the target substrates of BSH [2], [17]. However, deconjugation of bile acids by BSH compromises lipid metabolism and results in attenuated energy harvest. Therefore, we have proposed to develop BSH inhibitor-based alternatives to AGP for enhanced animal production and sustainability [20]; this recent study established a solid platform for us to discover novel BSH inhibitors. In this study, we improved the capacity to screen large quantities of compounds in a time efficient manner by developing and validating a HTS assay to rapidly identify BSH inhibitors. Overall, the ability of the HTS system to identify BSH inhibitors proved to be a reliable means of inhibitor detection. Validation work was able to confirm that many of our chosen HTS hit compounds displayed high levels of BSH inhibition as expected. However, false positives were also present; chrysophanol and folic acid, both recognized as inhibitors in the library screen, exhibited minimal enzyme inhibition or even slight enhancement (Table 1), which is likely due to solution stability or chemical properties [35]. For this pilot screening, we only had the time and resources to do one all-encompassing screen. A second re-screen, including only a subset of compounds of interest, would have been beneficial in confirming our suspected compounds as legitimate inhibitors. Thus, in future HTS using a much larger compound library, it is essential to select all positive hits individually from corresponding source plates – a so-called ‘cherry picking’ procedure – for confirmation using the same protocol. The Spectrum Collection library that was screened contained a wide range of structurally diverse compounds, including drug components, natural products, and other bioactive constituents. Several potent inhibitors confirmed by validation assay possess interesting beneficial qualities. Carnosic acid and epicatechin monogallate are both nutraceuticals with noted antioxidant and neuroprotective effects [36]–[40]. Additionally, carnosic acid is an anti-inflammatory [41] and epicatechin monogallate displays some chemopreventive [42] and antimicrobial properties [43]. Similarly, gossypetin was among the powerful inhibitors and also is noted to be both anti-inflammatory [44] and an antioxidant [45]. Each of these compounds warrants further animal research, and should availability permit, growth performance studies could reveal more as to their potential use. However, two particular compounds stood out as potent inhibitors with definite high potential as novel alternative to AGP: riboflavin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE, also called ‘phenethyl caffeate’). Riboflavin, or vitamin B2, plays a key role in energy metabolism and is a conenzyme in numerous redox reactions [46]. Aside from contributions to animal physiology, it is water-soluble and causes no known toxicities from supplementation at upper limits [47], although even at the lowest concentrations tested, riboflavin was still an extremely potent BSH inhibitor (Fig. 3B). Because it is an FDA-approved feed additive with well-established metabolic function and would be readily available to incorporate into feed, riboflavin likely may be an acceptable candidate to improve growth performance for food animals. CAPE, on the other hand, is an emerging bioactive studied because it has antioxidant [48]–[50], anticarcinogenic [51], [52], anti-inflammatory [50], [53], [54], immunomodulatory [52], and antimicrobial [54] effects. It is a phenolic component of propolis and can be directly extracted or artificially synthesized by several methods [55]. Although much research has been done to characterize the aforementioned effects of CAPE, no published data exist concerning its effects on growth performance of food animals. Because CAPE can inhibit BSH at low concentrations, a trial of this natural product as a feed supplement is also highly warranted. For initial evaluation of HTS hits, we eliminated the hits that fall in antimicrobial category when selecting the BSH inhibitors with potential as alternative to AGP. However, the finding that some antibiotic hits, such as tetracyclines that have been widely used as AGP, called our attention to a possible new mechanism of AGP: AGP may have a direct effect on the function of gut BSH enzymes [17], [56] aside from modulating gut microbial ecology for enhanced growth performance. Using standard BSH assay, in this study, we have confirmed that the tested tetracycline and β-lactam antibiotics could directly inhibit BSH activity. Notably, roxarsone, an arsenical drug that has been used in the poultry industry to improve weight gain, feed conversion, and pigmentation as well as to control coccidiosis [57], [58], also displayed potent inhibitory effect on BSH. Currently little is known about how roxarsone is metabolized by chickens to mediate growth promotion [58] although it is suspected it may be due to its angiogenic potential [59]. Our results suggest that roxarsone as well as some other AGP (e.g. tetracycline) may also exert their growth-promoting effect on food animals by direct inhibition of intestinal BSH enzymes for enhanced lipid metabolism and energy harvest. Thus, this unexpected finding suggests a new mode of action of AGP for promoting animal growth. The pilot HTS in this study confirmed that our HTS protocol is a valid BSH inhibitor detection method. Future screens using larger compound libraries may reveal more novel BSH inhibitors. Having a greater number of applicable compounds will allow us to choose those with the most redeemable qualities that would include animal and environmental safety, cost, and availability. In addition, large animal trials are needed to determine the effect of ‘champion’ BSH inhibitors on growth performance of food animals. While in vitro studies are absolutely essential to justify potential AGP alternatives, intestinal in vivo conditions are certainly more complex. The in vivo stability and bioavailability must be addressed in order to establish the validity and practicality of utilizing such inhibitors as a legitimate alternative to AGP. Moreover, growth performance parameters like body weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio will need to be measured as well as morphological characteristics of the intestinal tract and meat and carcass quality. This will help to rule out or identify any negative physiological consequences associated with prolonged use of a particular BSH inhibitor. For example, because the BSH inhibitors may improve lipid metabolism, it is important to determine that energy harvest and weight gain is partitioned adequately and not skewed toward excess fat deposition, which would be undesirable for industry and consumers. Thus, comprehensive animal trials are needed to address the above issues and corroborate the performance-boosting benefits of novel BSH inhibitors. Discovery of BSH inhibitors may help us develop ‘negative-traits-mitigation’ strategy to optimize probiotic products for enhanced growth performance of food animals and profitability of feed additive industry. It is no doubt that dietary probiotics, the normal commensal microorganisms, could exert various beneficial effects on food animals. However, probiotics do impose a variety of potential costs (or detrimental effects) to the animal host as well, which include the production of toxic metabolites, decreased fat digestability due to production of BSH, and the increase of mucus secretion and gut epithelial cell turn-over [2]. Since lactobacilli are dominant BSH-producers in the small intestine, dietary lactobacilli treatment may negatively affect lipid metabolism and energy harvest, consequently imposing negative impact on body weight gain. Recently, two different groups have reported that probiotic supplementation to diets significantly reduced body weight gain, fat digestibility, and feed conversion in broilers [60], [61]. Based on these findings, the investigators have proposed that the detrimental effects of the probiotics on chicken growth are likely attributed to the production of intestinal BSH by lactobacilli probiotics. These recent studies provided physiological evidence for relationship between lipid metabolism and the BSH activity/BSH-producers in the chicken intestine. Therefore, the overall beneficial effects associated with specific probiotics should be carefully evaluated. The BSH inhibitors may be used together with certain probiotics to maximize the beneficial effect of the probiotics by mitigating potential negative impact of probiotics on host fat digestion due to the production of BSH enzyme. The efficient HTS technology developed in this study should have the broad appeal to the community of researchers who study BSH and develop BSH-based practical applications. It has been increasingly recognized that intestinal BSH plays an important role in host metabolism and energy harvest [17], [56]. The BSH activity has significant impact on host physiology by disturbing conjugated bile salts-mediated fat metabolism and endocrine functions, consequently affecting body weight gain and even cholesterol level in humans [17], [56]. Despite the significance of gut BSH, research on BSH is still in its infancy [62]. Not surprisingly, little information exists concerning the compounds that inhibit or enhance the activity of BSH. Notably, the HTS method described in this manuscript could be easily modified to make it suitable for the discovery of BSH enhancers. Specifically, during our optimization experiments, we have observed that changing some parameters, such as using less rBSH, would prolong incubation time for full precipitation development. With the control of desired reaction time (e.g. 8 hr), the dynamics and magnitude of precipitation formation in each well (reflected by A600 value) could be monitored and used for screening BSH enhancers. Since enhanced BSH activity in the intestine could lower cholesterol level in humans [17], [56], we speculate that BSH enhancers have a potential application in human health. Together, this study successfully developed a timely HTS technology and established a solid platform for future large-scale discovery of BSH inhibitors as well as BSH enhancers.

Introduction The Red Sea represents a 450,000-km2 inlet of the Indian Ocean located between the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula. Among the most intriguing ecological niches in the Red Sea are its deep-sea brines, which exhibit unique and diverse geochemical conditions [1]. Twenty-five brine pools have been described to date in the Red Sea [2], however, our knowledge of the microbial communities that inhabit these pools, and how these organisms are affected by and contribute to the geochemical properties of their extreme environments, remains sparse. For example, the hot brine system at Atlantis II Deep (ATII) is the largest and best characterized pool in the Red Sea. Located at a depth of approximately 2200 m near the Central Rift (at around 21°20′ N), it is less than 100 m thick, and covers an area of 60 km2 [3]–[5]. The combination of anoxia and high pressure, increased temperature (68°C) and salinity (250 parts per thousand or 7.5 times that of normal seawater [6]) in the brine pool makes it an ideal setting for the study of extremophiles. The Atlantis II Deep is the largest marine sulfide deposit currently known and contains high concentrations of manganese, iron, molybdenum, cadmium, cobalt, copper, nickel, lead and zinc, as well as methane and other hydrocarbons [7]–[8]. The brine is stratified, with the lower convective layer (LCL) exhibiting the highest temperature and salinity, while the three upper convective layers (UCL1, 2 and 3) display step-wise drops in salinity and temperature [4]. Discovery Deep (DD) is likely linked to Atlantis II via subsurface connections [9], [10]. However, the lack of documented long-term temperature variations, suggests the absence of hydrothermal activity at this site [11]. The conditions in the Discovery Deep brine are less harsh and not as well described as Atlantis II, with relatively high concentrations of metals and a milder temperature of 44.8°C [12]. The microbial life found in the hot brine pools in the Red Sea has been little studied owing to technical constraints [reviewed in [12]. Microbial diversity studies based on cultivation-dependent and cultivation–independent approaches have focused mostly on the colder, northern brine pools of the Red Sea. These surveys have revealed an unexpected microbial diversity, including the identification of several new deeply branching phylogenetic lineages, and the isolation and description of several new unusual extremophiles [13], [14]. Studies on the hot brines of the Red Sea were much more limited, and include the isolation and description of Flexistipes sinusarabici (phylum Deferribacteres) from the Atlantis II brine pool [15]. A recent 16S rDNA survey suggested the presence of similar microbial communities in Atlantis II and Discovery Deep brines [16], while a comparative metagenomic analysis revealed profound differences in the dominant bacterial groups in these environments [17]. The latter study also identified genes associated with degradation of aromatic compounds in Atlantis II [17]. Whereas these previous studies have yielded insights into the composition and metabolic capabilities of microbial organisms in brine pools, the microbial assemblages that inhabit the sediments underlying the hot brine-pools in the Red Sea and it's relationship to sediment geochemistry have not been reported previously. Here we analyze and compare the prokaryotic microbiomes in several chemically and geologically distinct sediment sections of Atlantis II (ATII), Discovery (DD), Chain Deep (CD) and an adjacent brine-influenced (BI) site (Fig. 1) using 16S rDNA pyrotag sequencing. In this poorly explored marine environment, distinctively unique prokaryotic communities were observed in a sulfur-rich Atlantis II and a nitrogen-rich core section of Discovery Deep brine pool, providing insight into how geochemical components allocates ‘polyextremophiles’.10.1371/journal.pone.0042872.g001Figure 1Sediment samples.

The Atlantis II Deep area (between latitudes 21° 13′N and 21° 30′N and longitudes 37° 58′E and 38° 9′E) is in the central rift zone of the Red Sea, between Saudi Arabia and Sudan.

Carbon Hydrogen Nitrogen & Sulfur (CHN&S) profiling showed that the analyzed brine sediments and the adjacent BI sediments differed greatly in C and S content, whereas little variation was found in H (1.4–1.9% w/w) or N (<0.10 to 0.12% w/w) content (Table 2). Sulfur content was highest in the ATII sediment sections (mean 8.3% w/w) with the highest value found in the deepest analyzed section (ATII-1; 19% w/w). The sulfur content was on average much lower in the other brine (0.6% in DD and <0.10% in CD) and adjacent (BI; 0.3–1.0% w/w) sediments. SO42− concentrations varied more between ATII sediments than % sulfur, but were also found to be highest in the deepest ATII-1 section (20% w/w). Far lower SO42− concentrations were measured in the other brine and BI sediments (Table 2). Carbon content on the other hand was highest in DD (∼7% w/w) and BI (8.3–8.7% w/w) followed by one order of magnitude lower values in ATII and CD sediments (∼0.8% w/w). The highest level of carbon was found in DD-2. Interestingly nitrogen (0.22% w/w) was only detected in the deepest section of DD (DD-1).

The sediment reads were compared to 388,659 reads from the water column. Of the total sediment pyrotag library, 242,366 pyrotags represented bacteria and 377,425 represented archaea. The number of bacterial reads varied between 12,125 in ATII-1 and 22,540 in ATII-6. The number of archaeal reads generated varied between 1,624 in ATII-1 and 37,451 in DD-5. Unassigned reads (unknown) represented a relatively small proportion of the total pyrotags.10.1371/journal.pone.0042872.t003Table 3Pyrotag 16S rDNA data sets.ATII-1ATII-2ATII-3ATII-4ATII-5ATII-6DD-1DD-2DD-3DD-4DD-5DD-6DD-7CDBI-1BI-2Totalhighest Shighest N(Sediment)(water)Total14006404522889030079451505366536619390293814245080428133891840954421314362643965623519388659Archeal162428012156361396730232308132165225331230032887824067245622501027517284042871737742591747Bacterial12125122231307815765147372254014787135001493115933184491414315714144291499015022242366295277Unknown25721717634718131218019820826929721323018523222637281635DNA (ng)259290310300285225115300200453600150250520153250Taxonomic assignment of OTUs to major archaeal groups The overall archaeal community structure differed greatly between the S-rich ATII-1, N-rich DD-1, and the remaining sediments (Fig. 2, Table 4). Out of 39 archaeal OTUs analyzed, 10 were detected in both water column and sediments (Table S1), 6 were detected only in the water column (data not shown) and 23 were only detected in the sediments (Table S1, Table 4). To exclude potential contamination from the overlying water column we focus on the sediment only taxa, that doesn’t exclude the fact that taxa shared in sediment and water may also be present in sediments. In the S-rich ATII-1, euryarchaeota clearly dominated the archaeal community (96%) with 50% of the archaeal tags in this section being assigned to Marine Benthic Group E (MBG-E; Thermoplasmata), note that MBG-E was not detected in the water column. Other abundant euryarchaeota in ATII-1 were Methanomicrobia belonging to ANME-1b (25%) and the Methanosarcinales clade GOM ArcI. Pyrotags of the latter groups were not detected in any of the other sediment sections or the water column (Fig. 2, Table 4).10.1371/journal.pone.0042872.g002Figure 2Taxonomic assignment and abundance of archaeal communities in ATII, DD, CD and BI sediment samples.

Here, an unclassified family of the ST-12K10A lineage (SA1 group) represented the most abundant archaeal group (42%), whereas pyrotags of this archaeal family were very rare (0.1% in ATII-1) or absent in all other analyzed sediment sections and the water column. Uncultured Thermoplasmata of the South African Goldmine (SAG) Group, were found to be ten times more abundant in DD-1 (15%) than in the S-rich ATII-1, whereas MBG-E were 250 times less abundant than in the ATII-1 sections. Marine Group III (MG-III) Thermoplasmatales, which were not recovered from ATII-1, represented 0.2% of the total archaeal pyrotags in DD-1 (Table 4). Although not highly abundant, we detect a diverse and exclusive Halobacteriales-related pyrotags only in the N-rich Discovery Deep brine-pool sediments (Fig. 2, Table 4). Crenarchaeota assigned to Marine Group I (MGI) comprised only 1.9% in the S-rich ATII-1 and 34.3% in the N-rich DD-1 sediments, whereas members of this group represented the most abundant archaea in all other sediment sections (81.6±8.2%) including the water column (Table 4). Methanomicrobiales-Methanospirillum, Halobacteriales Deep Sea Hydrothermal Vent Group 6 and Terrestrial Hot Spring Crenarchaeota were detected in the remaining sediments but not in the water column (Table 4). Relative abundance-based hierarchical clustering of the 16S rDNA pyrotags assigned to major taxonomic groups allowed us to categorize the sediment archaeal communities into three major and distinct groups (Fig. 3A, Table S1) and to detect a set of sediment/brine specific archaeal OTUs (23) that were not detected in the overlying water column (Table S1). Group I (12 OTUs, of which 10 are sediment specific) was unique to the S-rich Atlantis II sample (ATII-1), group II (13 OTUs, of which 10 are sediment specific) was characteristic for the N-rich Discovery sample (DD-1), and group III (8 OTUs, of which 4 are sediment specific) reflected the composition of the remaining sediment samples.10.1371/journal.pone.0042872.g003Figure 3Heat map representation of the relative abundance of major archaeal (3a) and bacterial (3b) groups in ATII, DD, CD and BI sediment samples. Heat map showing a comparative taxonomic assignment of OTUs to major archaeal taxa (at the genus level). The different taxa represented in each group are illustrated in Table S1. The dendrogram show the hierarchical clustering of the different sediment sections based on the relative abundance of the OTUs in each section. The Z-scores shows the rescaling of the value of the row based on its mean and standard deviation. Group I (ATII-1), group II (DD-1), group IIIa (ATII-2-5), and group IIIb (all other samples) are presented. The taxonomically assigned OTUs are represented in ST-1.Taxonomic assignment of OTUs to major bacterial groups Similar to archaea, the bacterial community structure greatly differed between the S-rich ATII-1, N-rich DD-1, compared to the remaining overlying and adjacent sediments. Out of 171 bacterial OTUs, 75 were detected in both water column and sediments (Table S1), 42 were detected only in the water column (data not shown) and 48 were only detected in the sediments (Table S1, Table 4). In the S-rich ATII-1, Chloroflexi accounted for 32% of the assigned bacterial OTUs, with the order Anaerolineales predominating (Table 4, Fig. S1). The distribution of Chloroflexi was relatively constant, but at a much lower abundance (1.71±0.98%) in all other analyzed sediment sections. Fusobacteria (20%) and the OP1 division (15%) were two of the major bacterial phyla in the S-rich ATII-1 sample. The latter group also comprised 5% of the bacterial OTUs in DD-1 but was insignificant elsewhere (including the water column). In contrast to their high abundance in all the other samples, Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria constituted only 1% and 4% of bacterial OTUs in ATII-1, respectively. In the N-rich DD-1, Alphaproteobacteria dominated the bacterial community constituting 25% of bacterial OTUs, followed by Cyanobacteria with 22%. In other DD sediments, the latter phylum was far less prominent, and this variability is largely due to the contributions of an unassigned family related to Prochlorococcus (21%). Prochlorococcus constituted 4% (±8) of water column OTUs, and therefore the overlying water column could have compromised this sample. Based on the relative abundance of 16S rDNA pyrotags and their assignment to major bacterial groups a set of sediment/brine specific bacterial OTUs (48) were identified (Table S1). Additionally, three distinct sediment groups were observed in our samples. Group I (41 OTUs, of which 27 are sediment specific) are enriched in the S-rich Atlantis II sample (ATII-1), group II (31 OTUs, of which 15 are sediment specific) corresponds to the N-rich Discovery sample (DD-1), group IIIa (20 OTUs, of which 3 are sediment specific) in samples ATII-2 to ATII-5, while group IIIb (34 OTUs, of which 3 are sediment specific) reflects the combination of taxa found in all other samples (Fig. 3B, Table S1). Rare bacterial communities were determined by selecting OTUs that accounted for less than 1% of reads in all the samples. Comparative analysis of the less abundant bacterial genera leads to the same basic division into four consortia (Fig. S2, Table S2). The distinctive bacterial communities in the S-rich Atlantis II and N-rich Discovery samples are discussed in relation to sulfur and methane cycling below.Comparative analysis of microbial community in the Red Sea sediments with diverse oceanic systems To assess the uniqueness and diversity of the microbial communities present in the Atlantis II brine-system sediments, we compared the pyrotags recovered in this study with a global survey of sub-seafloor microbial communities. The 16S rDNA tag sequences that were used for this comparison are publicly available through the VAMPS website http://vamps.mbl.edu (project title ICM_GMS). We compared our data with oxic sediments from the White Oak River estuary in the North Atlantic Ocean [18], anoxic deep-sea hydrocarbon seeps from both a microbial mat and sediments [19] in the Gulf of Mexico, a microbial mat from the oxic Storegga seep enrichment on the continental shelf in the Norwegian Sea, an anoxic microbial mat from a carbonate reef in the Black Sea, and a microbial mat from an oxic hydrothermal vent in the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California. These oceanic sediments were surveyed as part of the ‘Microbial Census of Methane and Hydrocarbon Seep Sediments in Relation to Geochemical and Temperature Gradients’. Heat map analysis revealed four sample groups based on the unique microbial consortia present: I) ATII-1, II) DD-1, IIIa) ATII-2 to ATII-5 and IIIb) ATII-6, DD-2 to DD-7 and CD and BI (Fig. 3). A clustering analysis was used to compare and contrast our data with 16S rRNA (V6) obtained from the other oceanic systems. With respect to both Archaea and Bacteria, groups II and III clustered in one clade (Fig. 4A and 4B). Both the bacterial and archaeal assemblages at ATII-1 showed greater similarity with the consortia in the methane and hydrocarbon seep systems. Notably, ATII-1 showed a closer resemblance to the communities at marine hydrothermal vents in the Gulf of California (Fig. 4A).10.1371/journal.pone.0042872.g004Figure 4Cluster dendrogram illustrating the relationship of the (4a) archaeal and (4b) bacterial communities in the Red Sea to those in other oceanic systems. The dendrogram shows the complete linkage hierarchical clustering of the different sediment sections based on the relative abundance of the OTUs in each section. The height indicates the relative distances between the datasets. The data of other oceanic systems from the Guaymas Methane Seep (ICM GMS) project included Estuarine bulk water, North Atlantic Ocean (ICM GMS 1–2): oxic sediment from the White Oak River; Cold Seep1 Gulf of Mexico (ICM GMS 3–4): microbial mat; Cold Seep2,3 Gulf of Mexico (ICM GMS 5–8): sediments from anoxic deep-sea hydrocarbon seeps in the Gulf of Mexico; Continental shelf, Norwegian Sea (ICM GMS 13–14): an oxic microbial mat from the continental shelf at the Storegga seep enrichment in the Norwegian Sea; Carbonate reef Black Sea (ICM GMS 15–16): an anoxic microbial mat from the Black Sea; Marine hydrothermal vent1–2, Gulf of California (ICM GMS 17–20): microbial mat from the Gulf of California, oxic hydrothermal vent from Guaymas Basin.DiscussionUnique microbial taxa in the brine pool sediments that are enriched in the S-rich Atlantis II and the N-rich Discovery brine-pool sediments We identify the unique microbial communities in sediments from the three Red Sea brine pool sites. To exclude potential contamination from the overlying water column, we focus on the 48 sediment/brine specific bacterial taxa and 23 archaeal taxa. Although, the microbial communities in sediments from three Red Sea brine pool deeps and a brine-influenced site displayed very similar distributions of abundant and rare microbial groups, the deepest S-rich sediment section from Atlantis II and an N-rich section from Discovery Deep each revealed unique archaeal and bacterial communities. Clustering of 16S rDNA pyrotags from each sediment sample into major bacterial and archaeal groups on the basis of relative abundance and taxonomic assignment (Fig. 3, Table S1 and Fig. S2), allowed us to discern three major assemblages, comprising (I) taxa that are unique for S-rich ATII-1, (II) taxa unique for N-rich DD-1, (IIIa) taxa that are restricted to samples ATII-2 to ATII-4, and (IIIb) taxa that are found in all the remaining samples (i.e., ATII-5 and ATII-6, CD, BI and DD-2 to DD-7 (Fig. 3A). Note, that the water column is clustered into a fourth group, with a closer resemblance to group III (data not shown). Such clustering suggests vertical and horizontal variability in the prokaryotic community structure within the Atlantis II deep-sea brine system. Comparison with data from other oceanic sites revealed that the prokaryotic community in the ATII-1 is more closely related to prokaryotes found in methane and hydrocarbon seep sediments (Fig. 4). The detection of OTUs from known typical marine prokaryotic groups (e.g., MGI, Cyanobacteria and SAR11) might result from accumulation in the sediments of non-active or dead cells or even cellular debris previously active in the water column. It may also be a result of contamination from the overlying water column. However, we attempted to exclude such potential contaminants by subtracting ATII water column taxa from sediment taxa, and we have stressed on the sediment/brine-specific taxa in this study. However, this does not exclude that these OTUs may belong to sediment-clades or possibly new Atlantis II brine system clades. For example, members of the MGI seem to dominate the archaeal community in most sediment layers. Members of this group have been previously found within the brine-systems, but seemed to be restricted to the brine-seawater interface [12], probably reflecting the standard communities found in seawater above the brine. MGI is dominant in deep-sea water and surface (oxic) sediments, although populations in these two biotopes should not be assumed as being identical [20], [21] There are specific sediment phylotypes, distinct from seawater relatives [20]. Although we have only utilized one sediment core at each sample point, our results can be generalized to the entire brine because the physical conditions within the spatial dimensions of the brine pool are uniform. Performing a single DNA extraction protocol may also be a limitation in our study, suggesting a representation of, rather than the entire, microbiota in each site. The composition of the prokaryotic community in the S-rich section of Atlantis II sediments suggests metabolism based on sulfate reduction and methane consumption. On the other hand, the diversity and exclusive detection of selected Halobacteriales in the N-rich Discovery Deep sediment may be related to its characteristic elemental profile (discussed below).The S-rich subsection of the Atlantis II brine-pool sediment sample harbors a unique consortium of prokaryotes putatively involved in sulfate-reduction coupled with anaerobic oxidation of methane The oxidation of methane in anoxic marine sediments is mediated by consortia of methane-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing archaea and bacteria [22], in a process described in previous studies [23]. The exclusive combined presence of pyrotag related to archaeal and bacterial sulfate-reducing genera (Archaeoglobus [24], and Desulfovermiculus sp. (Deltaproteobacteria)) and anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaeal clusters ANME-1 (Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales) [25], ANME-2 and ANME-3 (Methanosarcinales), strongly argues for an exclusive inhabitance of microbial sulfate reduction coupled with anaerobic oxidation of methane in the S-rich ATII section (Fig. 3B). The distribution of Methanomicrobia in the S-rich Atlantis II sample is also unique, and quite distinct from those in the remaining samples. Methanosarcinales species were exclusively identified in the S-rich ATII-1. Methanomicrobia were identified in all the sediments analyzed, but their abundance and detailed composition varied widely. Methanomicrobia were most abundant in the S-rich ATII-1 and N-rich DD-1 samples, but accounted for <1% of reads in the remaining samples. The ANME-1b clade and the Methanosarcinales clade GOM-Arc-1 constituted the majority of Methanomicrobia in the S-rich ATII-1, while ST-12K10A (SA1) dominated the N-rich DD-1 sample, which was previously identified in Shaban Deep and brine-sea water interface of Discovery Deep [14]. Interestingly, in these two samples, hydrogenotrophic Methanomicrobiales (DD-1) and acetoclastic Methanosarcinales (ATII-1) were mutually exclusive. Presence of sulfate reducers would explain these differences as they would likely be partially involved in anaerobic methane oxidizing consortia with ANME and would simultaneously outcompete and exclude all methanogenic groups with the exception of Methanosarcinales [25], [26]. This implies distinctive styles of methane production in the S-rich Atlantis II and N-rich Discovery sediment sections. Overall, our comparative taxonomic assignments of OTUs that defined the four distinct microbial assemblages (Fig. 3B) reveal a unique consortium of methanogenic, ANME, and sulfate-reducing microbes that are distinct in the environments of S-rich ATII-1, N-rich DD-1 and the remaining samples.Diversity of denitrifying microbes in the N-rich subsection of the Discovery Deep brine-pool sediment Nitrification requires several groups of microorganisms and play a significant role in the nitrogen cycle [27]. Group II archaea were predominantly detected in DD-1 (Table 4 and Figs. 2B, 3B) and included potential ammonium oxidizers such as Crenarchaeum of the terrestrial hot spring group (Table 4) [28]–[30]. On the other hand, archaea known to be capable of reducing oxidized nitrogen species were also exclusively identified in DD-1, such as Halobacteriaceae; Natronomonas sp., Halococcus sp., Halobacterium sp., Halorabdus sp., Halosimplex sp., and an unassigned MSP41 genus (Fig. 2). A previous study documented an abundance of Halobacteriaceae in the Atlantis II and Discovery Deep overlying water column [16]. However, our analysis did not identify such abundance of Halobacteriaceae. These are capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite during anaerobic respiration [28]–[30]. Note that, in contrast to other analyzed brine and non-brine sediments, the archaea in Group II, which are present in DD-1, all cluster among ammonium oxidizers. Interestingly, the S-rich Atlantis II sections (ATII-1), was the only sample that had no detectable Halobacteriaceae related to nitrogen cycling. The diversity and detection of archaea previously known to play a role in nitrogen cycling in the N-rich Discovery sample implies an active role specifically in nitrogen regulation in this sediment section.Conclusion This study identifies three major microbial consortiums in sediments of brine and brine-influenced sites in the Red Sea. Based on taxonomic assignment of 16S rDNA OTUs to major bacterial and archaeal groups, the characteristic distributions of both the abundant and the rare taxa was revealed. A sulfur-rich Atlantis II and a nitrogen-rich Discovery Deep section harbored distinct prokaryotic assemblages that differed furthermore from those found in all other sediment samples examined. The exclusive combined presence of sulfate-reducing and anaerobic methane-oxidizing prokaryotes strongly argues for an exclusive importance of microbial sulfate reduction coupled with anaerobic oxidation of methane in the S-rich ATII section. Additionally, the diversity of denitrifying microorganisms in the N-rich Discovery section implies an active role in nitrogen cycling. More in depth characterization of the physical and chemical properties of these sediment sections combined with further metagenomics and metatranscriptomes could shed further insights into microbial metabolic processes and the cycling of (in)organic matter in these under-sampled extreme environments.Materials and MethodsSample collection The sediment samples from the Atlantis II, Discovery Deep, and Chain Deep brines, as well as from the brine-influenced site used for this study were collected during the 2nd KAUST/WHOI Red Sea Expedition of the RV Aegaeo in April 2010 (see Table 1 for details about the samples and sampling locations). All necessary permits were obtained for the described field studies. Between 3.5 and 4 m-long gravity cores (Benthos Instruments, KC Denmark) were obtained from the brine sediments, whereas the short BI core was obtained by multicoring. The water depth of the brine settings varied only between 1937 and 2168 m, but the brines differed greatly in temperature, being highest at ATII (68°C), followed by DD (45°C) and CD (32°C) (Table 1). The BI site was slightly shallower (1856 m water depth) and the temperature (22°C) was lowest of all settings. Water samples were collected from the overlying ATII water, at different depth 50 m, 200 m, 700 m and 1500 m (Ferreira et. al., submitted). Water depth in the Atlantis II Deep area was obtained during the cruise from a bathymetric survey with single-beam echo sounder on R/V Oceanus (Fig. 1A). Cores were divided into sections (numbered from bottom to top) and different sediment sections were studied separately (Fig. 1B). In ATII, six distinct sections of the sediment core were macroscopically identified (Fig. 1B). The bottom 50 cm of the ATII core (ATII-1) consisted of black slurry. ATII-2 was dominated by brown, ATII-3 by reddish-brown, and ATII-4 by brown clay. ATII-5 was composed of black slurry, while brownish slurry sediments (ATII-6) were found at the top of the core facing the lower convective layer of the pool. The seven DD sediment samples were less macroscopically distinct than the ATII sections (Fig. 1B). For the brine-influenced sediments, BI-1 comprised the top half (0–5 cm) and BI-2 bottom 5 cm of the core, although the two samples were not macroscopically distinct. All sediment samples were immediately frozen upon recovery, and kept at −20°C until further analysis.Chemical analysis Profiling of the elements C, H, N and S was performed by oxidation of the samples by flash combustion using a Thermo FlashEA 1112 elemental analyzer. The combusting gases were then separated by passage through a chromatographic column using He as a carrier gas, and were detected with thermal conductivity detector. Sulfate level was measured by ion chromatography.DNA extraction, pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons and computational analysis Genomic DNA was extracted 0.5–1 gm of sediment with the PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kit (MO-BIO, Calsbad, CA), the total amount of DNA isolated from the sediments is presented in Table 2. DNA was used for PCR amplification of environmental 16S rRNA genes (16S rDNA) for archaeal and bacterial taxonomic assignment after Sogin et. al. (2006) [31]. The primers utilized in this study were V6-V4 primer pairs (bacterial: 1046R CGACRRCCATGCANCACCT and 518F CCAGCAGCYGCGGTAAN; archaeal: 1048R CGrCrGCCATGyACCwC, arc517F1 GCCTAAAGCATCCGTAGC, arc517F2 GCCTAAArCGTyCGTAGC, arc517F3 GTCTAAAGGGTCyGTAGC, arc517F4 GCTTAAAGnGTyCGTAGC, and arc517F5 GTCTAAArCGyyCGTAGC. The amplicons recovered were then subjected to pyrosequencing by 454 GS FLX Titanium technology (454 Life Sciences). Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence tags and subsequent taxonomic assignments were performed using the resources on the Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures (VAMPS) website, hosted by the Josephine Bay Paul Center, MBL, Woods Hole (http://vamps.mbl.edu/resources/databases.php). To infer phylogenetic relationships among the identified Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), an initial taxonomic classification into bacterial or archaeal groups was performed. The OTUs were estimated by clustering the 910,068 raw 16S reads with an identity threshold >0.97% using USEARCH (http://www.drive5.com/usearch/). The seed (longest sequence that is at least 0.97% similar to all other sequences in the cluster), was utilized as the representative sequence (i.e., the OTU) of that cluster, resulting into a non-redundant set of 837 bacterial OTUs and 63 archaeal OTUs. For each domain, all OTUs across the different samples were aligned using MUSCLE [32]. The two generated multiple sequence alignments were visually inspected and manually tuned. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was then estimated based on the refined alignment under the GTR model [33] using FastTree [34]. Finally, the estimated tree was taxonomically annotated, and the normalized abundance levels of each OTU in the different samples were graphically represented on the trees as bars stemming from the corresponding OTU using iToL [35]. Heat maps were generated using data statistically filtered by a two-tailed Fisher's exact test (FET). The normalized read value for each taxon in a sample was compared to those of other samples, and to the totals of remaining taxa. Statistical analyses were performed using R (http://cran.r-prroject.org) [36]. Results were filtered for a p-value threshold <0.05. The frequency-normalized values of the filtered statistically significant data were used to create heat maps using the ‘enhanced heat map function’ from the R package gplots (http://cran.r-project.org/package=gplots). Complete linkage hierarchical clustering was used across the samples. The Pearson correlation distance matrix was calculated between the taxa. We also performed Euclidean distance Ward clustering approach and Spearman's correlation, which did not alter the clustering of the data (data not shown).Supporting InformationFigure S1 Taxonomic assignment and relative abundance of bacterial OTUs in ATII, DD, CD and BI sediment samples.

However in gliomas the role of this prostanoid is poorly understood. Here, we report on the proliferative, migratory, and apoptotic effects of PGE1, PGE2 and Ibuprofen (IBP) observed in the T98G human glioma cell line in vitro. T98G human glioma cells were treated with IBP, PGE1 or PGE2 at varying concentrations for 24–72 hours. Cell proliferation, mitotic index and apoptotic index were determined for each treatment. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity was measured using fluorescent probes in live cells (FITC-LEHD-FMK and FITC-DEVD-FMK respectively). The migratory capacity of the cells was quantified using a scratch migration assay and a transwell migration assay. A significant decrease was seen in cell number (54%) in the presence of 50 μM IBP. Mitotic index and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation were also decreased 57% and 65%, respectively, by IBP. The apoptotic index was increased (167%) and the in situ activity of caspase-9 and caspase-3 was evident in IBP treated cells. The inhibition of COX activity by IBP also caused a significant inhibition of cell migration in the monolayer scratch assay (74%) and the transwell migration assay (36%). In contrast, the presence of exogenous PGE1 or PGE2 caused significant increases in cell number (37% PGE1 and 45% PGE2). When mitotic index was measured no change was found for either PG treatment. However, the BrdU incorporation rate was significantly increased by PGE1 (62%) and to a greater extent by PGE2 (100%). The apoptotic index was unchanged by exogenous PGs. The addition of exogenous PGs caused an increase in cell migration in the monolayer scratch assay (43% PGE1 and 44% PGE2) and the transwell migration assay (28% PGE1 and 68% PGE2). The present study demonstrated that treatments which alter PGE1 and PGE2 metabolism influence the proliferative and apoptotic indices of T98G glioma cells. The migratory capacity of the cells was also significantly affected by the change in prostaglandin metabolism. Modifying PG metabolism remains an interesting target for future studies in gliomas.

Background Malignant gliomas and especially Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are the most malignant and prevalent intracranial tumours, classified as grade IV by the World Health Organization (WHO). GBMs are characterized by genetic alterations affecting genes that control cell growth, migration, apoptosis, and invasion. Despite very aggressive treatment including surgery and combined radio and chemotherapy the median survival for most patients with GBM is only 1 year. Therefore there is an urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic agents [1,2]. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the treatment of pain, fever and inflammation caused by various physiological or pathological conditions. Clinical trials have demonstrated that long-term NSAID use significantly reduces the risk of colorectal cancer and other tumours such as breast, lung, prostate and gastric cancer [3-5]. NSAIDs are known to inhibit a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction, transcription, and DNA repair. NSAIDs can alter cell cycle distribution, inhibit cyclins, modulate Bcl-2 family proteins and induce apoptosis [6,7]. NSAIDs also inhibit angiogenesis, an important factor necessary for tumour growth and survival, suggesting a rationale for their potential therapeutic application as anticancer agents [8]. The mechanism by which NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory activity is primarily by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins through inhibition of both cyclooxygenase isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2), the rate-limiting enzyme of the cascade. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many tissues and plays an important role in the control of homeostasis. Conversely, COX-2 is an inducible enzyme and is activated in response to extracellular stimuli such as growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines [9,10]. Several studies have shown COX and PGs play a role in cell growth, survival, migration/invasion and angiogenesis of tumour cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that the increase in overexpression of COX-2 and PGE2 in human glioma is associated with poor prognosis and tumour progression [11,12]. Ibuprofen (IBP) belongs to the group of NSAIDs, and is a potent COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor. Besides its widespread use in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, it has been shown that IBP may be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of cancers including prostate and colorectal cancer [13-15]. However, the effect of IBP treatment in GBM has not been widely investigated. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown novel ruthenium-containing IBP complexes have significant effects on glioma cell proliferation and apoptosis [16,17]. In this study, we aimed to assess the potential effects of IBP on tumour cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis in T98G human glioma cells. The effect of the addition of exogenous PGE1 and PGE2 to the cells was also studied. PGE1 was compared with PGE2 as it has been reported to interact not only with the EP receptors EP3 and EP4 but also with the IP receptor, while PGE2 can interact with all four EP receptors. The cellular response to PGE1 and PGE2 depends on both the expression of receptors and the synthetic capacity of the individual tissue [18]. The study aimed to test the importance of PGE1 and PGE2 metabolism to the proliferative and apoptotic indices of T98G glioma cells. Since prostanoids are also involved in cell migration the effect of IBP, PGE1 and PGE2 on the migratory capacity of the cells was investigated using two migration assays.MethodsCell culture T98G cells, derived from a human glioblastoma, were obtained from the ATCC and donated by Prof. S.S. Maria-Engler. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 50U/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells in the exponential phase of growth were used, growing in 75 cm2 flasks in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37°C. After growth to the desired density cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized (trypsin 0.025%/ EDTA 0.02%) for subsequent plating. All experiments used cells grown in DMEM with FCS and antibiotics as stated above.Drug treatment Ibuprofen (Cayman Chemicals) was dissolved in ethanol to achieve the stock concentrations desired. PGE1 and PGE2 (Cayman Chemicals) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich). All drugs were further diluted in DMEM (Gibco BRL) to their final concentration.Cell proliferation assay The cells were treated with IBP (25–200 μM), PGE1 (0.01–10 μM) or PGE2 (0.01–10 μM) for up to 72 hours in 75 cm2 flasks. After that, the cells were harvested with trypsin (trypsin 0.025%/ EDTA 0.02%) and the cell number was determined in an improved Neubauer counting chamber [19]. The cell proliferation assay was conducted three times for each concentration.Analysis of nuclear morphology The IBP, PGE1 or PGE2 treated and control cells were fixed in situ with 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. The cells were washed (x3) with PBS, pH 7.2, and incubated with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were examined and immediately photographed using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Optiphot-II epifluorescence microscope equipped with, a Cool Snap Pro camera, and Image Pro plus software). Apoptotic cells can be distinguished from viable cells by their nuclear morphology with nuclear condensation and fragmentation, as well as by the higher intensity of blue fluorescence of the nuclei. The mitotic index was determined by the number of cells in cell division. A total of 200 cells were counted in multiple randomly selected fields, and the percentage of apoptotic and mitotic index cells were then calculated per total cell number.Migration assay Cells were plated into 30 mm petri dishes (1.5 x 105/dish) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2: 95% air at 37°C. During the given period of 48 hours, the cells were treated daily with IBP (25 μM and 50 μM), PGE1 (10 μM) or PGE2 (10 μM). Before the end of treatment, the cell layer was scraped with a sterile razor blade (marking the point of zero migration) and the petri dish returned to the incubator for a further 10 hours in the presence of treatments. At the end of this 10 hours incubation period, the cells were fixed in situ with 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. The cells were washed (x3) with PBS, pH 7.2, and incubated with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 5 min at room temperature. The samples were washed (x3) with PBS, pH 7.2, before mounting in SlowFade mounting medium. Cells were analyzed with a Nikon Optiphot-II epifluorescence microscope equipped with, a Cool Snap Pro camera, and Image Pro plus software. The results were expressed as the number of migrating cells per mm2 of scratched area of petri dish [20].Transwell migration assay A second migration assay was performed using the 24-well Boyden chamber plate with 8-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane filters. T98G cells (5 × 104/well) were placed in the upper part of the Boyden chamber containing DMEM and 10% FCS, the lower chamber also contained DMEM and 10%FCS. After a period of cell adhesion (12 h) the medium was changed and treatment (IBP, PGE1 and PGE2) was added to both parts of the chamber. The culture media with treatment was changed daily for 48 h. After incubation, the cells on the membrane filter were fixed with methanol and stained with 0.05% crystal violet for 30 min. The cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed with a cotton swab. The membranes were then rinsed in PBS until excess stain was removed. The membranes were then were air-dried for 20 min. The migratory cells were determined by counting the cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter by bright field microscopy at 200× magnification. Five random fields were counted for each filter, and each sample was assayed in triplicate.5-Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation (BrdU) BrdU incorporation assay (5-Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation) was used to evaluate the synthesis of DNA. T98G cells were seeded in 6-well plates (5 × 104/well), followed by treatments for 72 h, as indicated. Cells were then incubated with 10 μM BrdU from 45 min, followed by fixation in 4% formaldehyde. After this, cells were washed with PBS/ 0.2% Triton and incubated with 2 M HCl for 10 min at room temperature. At the end of 10 min, the cells were placed in an oven at 40°C for 20 min. The blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity was carried out for 30 min with H2O2 (3%) in methanol/H2O followed by washing. The blocking of nonspecific sites was carried out with glycine and normal donkey serum for 1 h. The cells were then incubated “overnight” with primary anti-BrdU antibody. On the following day cells were incubated for 90 minutes with biotinylated secondary antibody and then washed again with PBS/0.2% Triton. The secondary antibody was detected by incubation with a streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase for 60 min and washed, before reaction with 3,3′- diaminobenzidine (DAB)/H2O2. Cells were left in the developing solution for 2–10 min, counter-stained with 0.1% methyl green, dehydrated and mounted with Permount. The samples were photographed at random in five different fields and the percentage of BrdU positive cells was determined as a percentage of the total cell population [21].Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 activity assay T98G cells were seeded in 12 well plates (5 × 104/well) and incubated for 72 h with IBP, PGE1 or PGE2. After this period the cells were harvested with trypsin and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 2 min. The pellet was resuspended in culture medium with treatment, 1 μl FITC-LEHD-FMK substrate for caspase-3 or 1 μl FITC-DEVD-FMK substrate for caspase-9, and 1 μl Hoechst 33342 at 37°C. Cells were washed and resuspended in caspase assay kit buffer. After mounting, the cells were viewed and photographed in a fluorescence microscope Nikon Optiphot-II equipped with a Cool Snap Pro camera and Image Pro Plus software.Statistical analysis All data are presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was carried out with the Graphpad InStat software. One-way ANOVA with a multiple comparison t-test was used for data analysis. Difference at level of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsEffect of IBP on cell proliferation and apoptosis To determine the importance of PGE1 and PGE2 to cell proliferation, T98G cells were treated with IBP, PGE1 or PGE2 for 72 h (Figure 1). Cell counting showed that the cell number was time and dose dependently decreased by IBP (Figure 1A). In contrast, the presence of PGE1 or PGE2 caused a time and dose dependent increase in cell number (Figure 1B and 1C). Further experiments in the study used the concentrations of 25 and 50 μM IBP, 10 μM PGE1 and 10 μM PGE2. Figure 1 Effect of IBP, PGE1and PGE2on T98G cell number. (A) Cell number decreased dose and time dependently in the presence of IBP. (B) and (C) Cell number increased dose and time dependently in the presence of PGE1 and PGE2. Data are from three independent experiments in triplicate. Statistical significance, * p < 0.05 vs control. These experiments were designed to determine the concentrations and times of incubation for each compound for the remainder of the study. Cell counting showed that treatment with the lower dose of IBP inhibited proliferation by 45% and at 50 μM this inhibition increased to 54% (Figure 2A). Figure 2 Effect of IBP on cell number, mitotic index and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in T98G cells. (A) IBP decreased cell number after 72 h at both 25 and 50 μM. Statistical significance, *p = 0.0010 and **p = 0.0005, n = 3. (B) The number of cells in mitosis was obtained by Hoechst 33342 staining, and counting at x200 magnification. Statistical significance, *p = 0.0001, n = 8. (C) The nuclear incorporation of BrdU in the S-phase was measured after DAB staining and methyl green counterstaining. Statistical significance, *p < 0.0011, n = 4. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Additional experiments proved that longer periods of exposure to IBP caused an even greater decrease in cell number (Figure 3). Cell numbers at 5 days IBP were decreased by 67.8% and 79.7% for 25 μM and 50 μM, respectively. After 10 days IBP cell number were decreased by 80.8% and 91.0% for 25 μM and 50 μM, respectively. After 10 days IBP at 50 μM the decrease in cell number (91.0%) reached levels greater than 3 days IBP at 200 μM (88.4%) (Figure 1A). Figure 3 Effect of IBP after 3, 5 and 10 days on T98G cell number. (A-C) IBP decreased cell number after 3, 5 and 10 days at both 25 and 50 μM. Statistical significance, *p = 0.0010 and **p = 0.0005, n = 3. The fraction of cells in mitosis was quantified by calculation of the mitotic index. The fraction of cells in mitosis also decreased by 57% at 50 μM IBP (Figure 2B). Similarly, the percentage of BrdU positive cells decreased by 50% (25 μM IBP) and 65% (50 μM IBP) (Figure 2C). The overall finding for cell proliferation was an approximately 55–60% decrease in the presence of 50 μM IBP by the three methods used in the study. The effects of IBP on apoptosis were analysed by Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining and visualization of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity in live cells. Data from Hoechst 33342 (Figure 4A) showed a higher percentage of apoptotic nuclei in IBP cells compared to the control group. Apoptosis increased by 167% in the presence of 50 μM IBP. Evidence of caspase-9 and caspase-3-like activity was seen in the form of fluorescence substrate cleavage only in the 50 μM IBP treated cells and representative images are shown in Figure 4B-D. Figure 4 Effect of IBP on apoptosis of T98G cells. (A) Morphological changes in the nuclei typical of apoptosis were analysed after staining with Hoechst 33342.

Nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342.Effect of IBP on cell migration To investigate the effect of IBP on glioma cell migration ability, scratch migration assays and transwell migration assays were performed. As shown in Figure 5A-B, cell migration in the scratch migration assay was reduced by 40% in cells treated with 25 μM ibuprofen and 74% in cells treated with 50 μM IBP. Inhibition of migration was also seen in the transwell assays with 36% inhibition at 50 μM compared with control cells (Figure 5C-D). Figure 5 Effect of IBP on T98G cell migration.

(D) Representative images of crystal violet stained control and 50 μM IBP treated cells.Effect of PGE1 and PGE2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis In the case of treatment with exogenous PGE1 and PGE2, the results showed an increase of 37% with PGE1, while PGE2 increased proliferation by 45% when compared with the control (Figure 6A-B). When mitotic index was measured the presence of PGE’s did not have a significant effect (Figure 6C-D). However, the percentage of BrdU positive cells in cells treated with PGE1 or PGE2 was increased by 62% and 100%, respectively (Figure 6E-F). Figure 6 Effect of PGE1and PGE2on cell number, mitotic index, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and apoptosis in T98G cells. (A) Both PGE1 and PGE2 increased cell number at 10 μM after 72 h treatment. Statistical significance *p = 0.0007 and **p = 0.0008, n = 4.

(D) Morphological changes in the nuclei typical of apoptosis were analysed after staining with Hoechst 33342. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. The effect of PGE1 and PGE2 on apoptosis was also analysed by Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining, and detection of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity. Data from Hoechst 33342 staining (Figure 6 G-H) showed no difference in the number of apoptotic cells. The presence of activated caspase-9 and caspase-3 in the PGE treated cells was no different from the very low levels found in the control cells, unlike the results found for IBP treated cells (data not shown).Effect of PGE1 and PGE2 on cell migration Unlike IBP, the treatment with exogenous PGE1 and PGE2 increased cell migration in both assays. PGE1 increased migration by 43% in the scratch migration assay and by 28% in the transwell assay (Figure 7A-D). PGE2 increased migration by 44% in the scratch migration assay and by 68% in the transwell assay (Figure 8A-D). Figure 7 Effect of PGE1on T98G cell migration.

In our study, we showed that IBP potently inhibited proliferation, migration and induced apoptosis in T98G human glioma cells. It has been shown that several NSAIDs are able to induce glioma cell apoptosis [22]. Previous studies have shown that in various tumours a high concentration of PGE2 and a high COX-2 activity are present. Overexpression of COX-2/PGE2 in human tumors is associated with progression, invasion and angiogenesis [23-25]. However, the mechanism of COX-2/ PGE2 up regulation in glioma cells is still poorly defined. IBP, a generic and relatively inexpensive, non-selective COX inhibitor, is still widely used in clinical practice in the treatment of various cancers including colon and prostate cancer [3-5]. Despite enthusiasm about the potential usefulness of NSAIDs as anticancer agents, little has been reported about the effects of IBP on brain tumours. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IBP upon the proliferation, migration and apoptosis processes in glioma cells. Studies demonstrated that the proliferation and invasion of cultured glioma cell lines was inhibited in vitro by the specific COX-2 inhibitor NS-398, suggesting a functional role for COX-2/ PGE2 in glioma [26]. In our study we showed that IBP in doses of 25 μM and 50 μM inhibited the proliferation of T98G cells dose and time dependently. These findings are compatible with a study that showed that inhibition of COX activity and expression blocked the release of PGE2 from U87-MG human glioma cells and this generated a decrease in their proliferation [27]. In a recent study nano-prodrugs of IBP caused a greater reduction in cell proliferation in comparison with the nano-prodrugs of indomethacin or naproxen in the U87-MG cell line [28]. PGE2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Inhibition of COX-2 was recently reported to decrease migration as well as invasion of human endometrial epithelial and stromal cells. Results of the study indicate that selective inhibition of PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4 suppresses expression and/or activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2 and MMP9) proteins and increases expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP1, TIMP2, TIMP3, and TIMP4) proteins and thereby decreases migration [29]. In another study PGE2 treatment significantly increased cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In addition, the effects of PGE2 were found to be associated with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity [30]. Indomethacin treatment reduced PGE2 content in normal and tumour tissue colorectal cancer. This reduction in tumour tissue PGE2 content was related to significant alterations in the expression of several hundred genes including genes related to cell cycle control and apoptosis [31]. Interestingly, indomethacin-loaded nanocapsules inhibited the growth of glioma cells in vitro and the C6 rat glioma model in vivo [32,33]. Our results demonstrated that T98G glioma cells showed signs of apoptosis after treatment with both concentrations of IBP. We found that after IBP treatment, chromatin condensation and fragmentation were increased in the nuclei. In a recent study, the treatment of U87-MG glioma cells with IBP nano-prodrugs (25 μM and 50 μM) resulted in a significant increase in cell death [27]. In another study the NSAID aspirin induced apoptosis by the inhibition of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 in the A172 glioblastoma cell line [34]. From these studies it is apparent that inhibition of PG production by NSAIDs causes the induction of apoptosis in glioma cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that IBP treatment suppressed T98G human glioma cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro. In addition IBP caused a significant inhibition of T98G migration. In contrast, the addition of either exogenous PGE1 or PGE2 caused a significant increase in cell proliferation and increased cell migration. The difference in PGE1 and PGE2 effects on cell migration may be related to the expression profile of EP and IP receptors in the T98G cell line and requires further investigation. Altering prostaglandin metabolism remains a promising target for GBM treatment and is currently being studied in our laboratory.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors’ contributions RNG participated in the execution and analysis of the study.

Introduction The interactions between plants and micro-organisms in nature are complex and diverse. Microbes can be potential pathogens or beneficial partners, and plants have developed sophisticated mechanism to detect and neutralize them or to make use of their metabolism. Conversely microbes have evolved mechanisms to evade plant immune systems and to use plants as nutritional reservoirs. This co-evolution of plants with micro-organisms has lead to the occurrence of different families of molecules involved in microbial recognition. Microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) are structural components of the microbes that can be recognized by the plant and induce pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), the first immune barrier [1]–[3]. MAMPs are conserved within specific microbial families and include diverse molecules such as flagellin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), fungal chitin or the bacterial EF-Tu elongation factor [4]–[6]. Their recognition is also essential for the establishment of beneficial interactions, a process that is coupled to the suppression of PTI [7], [8]. Plants perceive the different types of MAMPs through specific pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), the best known of which include LRR (Leucin-Rich Repeat) receptor-like proteins (RLPs) and receptor-like kinases (RLKs) [9]. These families of receptors are also found in mammals. In contrast to mammals, plant genomes contain hundreds of genes encoding for RLK and RLP proteins [10], [11]. In addition, there are many “orphan” MAMPs that are known to elicit immune response in plants but for which the specific receptors have not yet been discovered. Successful pathogens have also evolved virulence effectors to interfere with PTI and render the plant susceptible to infection. Pseudomonas syringae for example, produces more than 30 different effectors that are secreted upon contact with host plants and target PTI components [12], [13]. As a counterpart, plants have developed corresponding resistance (R) proteins to recognize these effectors and their modified targets, which results in effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [2]. ETI also involves specific families of plant proteins, notably nucleotide-binding-LRR (NB-LRR) proteins [14], which are believed to integrate effector perception and activation of immune-inducible genes through interactions between their modular domains [15]. Although PTI and ETI responses trigger different defence mechanisms in plants, the distinction between both types of immunity is not always clear [16], [17]. The diversity of MAMPs or virulence effectors that microorganism can display and the multiplicity of the LRR-type receptors that are encoded in plant genomes suggest that a large number of plant proteins could participate in the recognition of bacterial molecules. In this regard, high-throughput protein-interaction screenings are suitable to determine which plant proteins can function as immune receptors for microbial ligands [17], [18]. As an example, by using a yeast two hybrid-based pipeline an interaction network with different pathogen effectors has been created that includes more than 8,000 Arabidopsis proteins [18]. Phage display has been used for more than twenty five years as a powerful tool to discover protein-ligand interactions [19]–[21]. With this technique, peptides or proteins are functionally displayed on a viral surface as fusions with viral coat proteins, and ligands of interest are used to select for interacting partners. Since the displayed protein and its encoding gene are physically linked in the same viral particle, the identification of selected proteins only requires nucleic acid sequencing. Another key feature of this technology is that allows for the display of large numbers (up to ∼1011) of peptide variants. Individual phage clones are selected from billions of different phage particles on the basis of the binding affinity of their displayed protein for the ligand of choice; selected clones are then amplified and the process iterated to enrich the initial phage population in affinity-binding clones. This so-called bio-panning selection can be manipulated to result in a fine tuning of protein-ligand interaction in the presence of competitive partners. The possibility of selecting strong protein-ligand interactions between competing partners made phage display a widely-used technology to discover high-affinity antibodies [22]. In addition, the versatility of phage libraries and bio-panning techniques makes the technology suitable for the isolation of a variety of naturally occurring proteins which interact with their physiological ligands. cDNA libraries displayed in phage particles have been used to identify natural protein complexes in a similar way to two-hybrid screening or to discover in vivo interactions by injection into living animals and recovery of targeted organs [23]. In this paper we constructed two phage-display libraries from the cDNA of microbe-challenged Arabidopsis. Recombinant phage displaying plant proteins capable of interacting with different species of Pseudomonas were selected by bio-panning using microbial cells as selection ligands. Selected phage were identified by two approaches i) sequencing of the dominant clones isolated after bio-panning and ii) hybridization of total vs. selected cDNAs to Arabidopsis microarrays. The latter was used to compare microbe-binding properties of selected clones on a genome-wide scale. We identified plant proteins involved in defence response and confirmed in vitro its capacity to bind microbial cells. The use of different strains of Pseudomonas allowed us to discern between common bacterial receptors and specific targets of virulent or avirulent strains.Results1 Construction of Arabidopsis cDNA libraries for phage-display We used two species of Pseudomonas to elicit immune response in Arabidopsis. This genus includes very ubiquitous bacteria able to parasite a wide range of hosts. P. aeruginosa is typically an opportunistic pathogen of humans which also infects other vertebrates, insects and plants [24], whereas P. syringae is a natural pathogen of plants with different host-specific pathovars. Both species share common MAMPs and effectors [24], [25] but differ in their adaptation to specific host biology and defence mechanisms [12], [26]. The library T7LAtPa was constructed with cDNA obtained from plants infected with the PA14 strain of P. aeruginosa (Pa) [27], [28]. In this infection model, plants were grown in liquid medium and bacteria were inoculated as described by these authors; mRNA was purified at different times post-infection and pooled for cDNA preparation. For the T7LAtPs library plants were grown in soil and infected with P. syringae pv. tomato by infiltration of bacteria into plant leaves; plants were infiltrated either with the virulent strain DC3000 (Pst) or its avirulent variant Pst(avrRpt2) [29] and cDNAs were pooled before the cloning step. In both cases an early defence response was observed in the plant as chlorotic lesions appearing on the infected tissues. The infection with Pa or Pst strains progressed until plant death, whereas Pst(avrRpt2) only caused a hypersensitive reaction without further damage for the host. Plant cDNAs were cloned into the T7Select10-3 vector. This system uses the T7-10B capsid protein of lytic phage to display foreign polypeptides of up to 1200 amino acids. cDNAs that are cloned in frame with the 3′ end of the T7-10B-encoding gene (about 1/3 of the fusions) can be displayed as recombinant proteins on the viral surface. The recombinant phage genomes generated after cDNA ligation into the vector were in vitro packaged to generate a primary library, which was next transfected into the E .coli host to allow for replication and translation of recombinant capsids. Transfected cultures were plated with molten agarose to determine the number of plaque forming units (pfu) in the primary library and then amplified to 1010–1011 pfu/ml. These amplified suspensions constituted our stock libraries for further bio-panning experiments. To estimate the complexity of the libraries we analyzed the inserts contained in a representative fraction of amplified viral clones (Table 1). According to this estimation, the T7LATPa library contained at least 7.7×104 different cDNA inserts, whereas the T7LATPs library, where the size and the proportion of clones with insert were higher, contained 2.3×107. Considering that 1/3 of the cloned cDNAs are expected to be in-frame fusions, both libraries should contain at least one in-frame cDNA fragment representative for each protein encoded in the A. thaliana genome (about 2.5×104 protein-encoding genes). Further hybridizations of the labelled cDNA inserts with high-coverage microarrays for Arabidopsis confirmed a wide representation of genes in the T7LAtPs library (Figure S1). Hybridization of this library produced detectable signals for 24,836 out of the 29,110 gene elements spotted in the microarray, whereas 13,720 elements were detected in the T7LAtPa library.10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.t001Table 1Characteristics of the phage-display libraries constructed for this study.LibraryParameterT7LAtPaT7LAtPsMicroorganism infected in ArabidopsisP. aeruginosaP. syringaeTotal pfu in primary library (a)7×1056×107Clones with insert (b)20%70%Insert sizes (kb)0.2–1.50.2–2.2Non-redundant inserts (c)55%55%Most redundant insert5.6%16%Total number of non-redundant inserts (d)7.7×1042.3×107 d = a×b/100×c/100.2 Selection of Pseudomonas-bound clones by bio-panning Both libraries were panned to select for phage clones displaying candidate targets for MAMPs or virulence effectors. Since some effectors might be expressed by the pathogen only upon contact with the host, bacterial cells were handled as in the root infection model described for PA14 strain [28]. Bacteria were incubated together with A. thaliana plantlets in liquid MS medium and recovered alive from plant surfaces before using them as the ligands for selection. Bio-panning was performed by incubating the amplified phage libraries (6.3×109 pfu) with these infective cells of Pa (T7LAtPa library), Pst or Pst(avrRpt2) strains (T7LAtPs library in both cases). Pseudomonas-bound phage were recovered by elution from bacterial pellets and re-amplified to 6.3×109 pfu for successive rounds of selection. Eluates were titred after each round to assess for the enrichment in specific-binding clones (Figure 1). Bio-panning of the T7LAtPa library with Pa cells produced eluates with an initial titre of 1.5×105 pfu/ml (in the first round), which increased up to a maximum of 5×107 pfu/ml in the 5th round. Bio-panning of the T7LAtPs library with Pst or Pst(avrRpt2) cells produced titres similar to those of Pa in the first round, but reached a maximum more rapidly (after 3 rounds 4.3×107 pfu/ml for Pst(avrRpt2) and 2.8×107 pfu/ml for Pst). However bio-panning with agarose beads as a control for non-specific binding failed to produce high eluate titres, with the number of eluted phage falling down to 103 pfu/ml in the 5th round. These data suggested that enrichment in specific-binding clones already happened in rounds 5th (Pa) and 3rd (Pst(avrRpt2) and Pst), and additional rounds of amplification and selection were not required.10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.g001Figure 1Titres of eluted phage increase after successive rounds of bio-panning with Pseudomonas sp. Bacteria were pre-incubated with 10-to-15-days old plantlets in liquid MS medium and collected from the roots before bio-panning. Phage (6.3×109 pfu from T7LAtPa or T7LAtPs libraries) were panned against 1 OD of (A) Pa (B) Pst(avrRpt2) (avr) (C) Pst or (D) agarose (Agar). After washes, bound phage were eluted and amplified for the next round of bio-panning. The titres of eluted (black dots, continuous line) or amplified (white dots, dashed line) phage were calculated by pfu-counting. The arrows indicate the peak of maximal titre for each pan series.3 Sequence analysis of dominant clones selected by bio-panning The pool of cDNA inserts contained in the eluates from maximum-titre rounds (the 5th round for Pa or 3rd round for Pst and Pst(avrRpt2) strains) was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotides in the flanking regions of the T7-10B gene. The cDNA amplicon from the panned eluates was enriched in specific bands when compared to the “smear” from non-panned libraries (not shown). Thus, the increase of the eluate titres after bio-panning correlated with enrichment in certain types of cDNA inserts, which strengthened the hypothesis of specific selection occurring between these rounds. The eluates from enriched rounds contained between 4×106 and 4.8×107 pfu (Figure 2A). To identify the dominant clones selected, the eluates were diluted and plated, and individual pfu were randomly picked to sequence their cDNA inserts. A total of 156 clones from the 3 bio-pannings were analyzed. As expected, most inserts were present as redundant copies and only 27 different sequences were found (Figure 2A, B). The study of their fusion sites resulted in the identification of 10 different polypeptides in frame with the T7-10B minor coat protein. Their description and the fraction of the full-length protein that is fused to T7-10B are shown in Table 2. The most abundant clone rescued from the Pa bio-panning encoded for the defence-related protein ATERF-1 (At4g17500), a member of the AP2/ERF-family of transcription factors which is highly induced upon infection with different pathogens [30]–[32]; the ATERF-1 fusion to T7-10B (amino acids 176 to 268) comprises the DNA-binding and defence-related domains. The PSAN subunit of photosystem I (At5g64040) and the anti-silencing protein AtSP7 (At1g66740) were the dominant clones identified from Pst(avrRpt2) bio-panning and both contained significant fragments of the full-length proteins (82% and 83% respectively). The major in-frame clone rescued from Pst bio-panning encoded for the ubiquitin-activating enzyme ATUBA1 (At2g30110). This protein has a role in defence, since a 15-bp deletion in its C-terminus (mos5 mutant) is able to revert the constitutive defence response phenotype of snc1 mutant [33]. Interestingly, the fusion with the T7-10B protein in the rescued clone covers the fragment of ATUBA1 that is deleted in mos5 (amino acids 1040 to 1080).10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.g002Figure 2Sequence analysis of 156 phage clones eluted after bio-panning with Pa, Pst(avrRpt2) (avr) or Pst strains.

Phage displaying the ATERF-1 polypeptide (T7-ATERF-1 clone) or a competing, non-related peptide (T7-C1 clone), were bio-panned against bacterial cells. The T7-ATERF-1:T7-C1 phage clones were mixed in three different input proportions (1∶1, 1∶6 and 1∶17) and bio-panned against the three strains of Pseudomonas or against agarose as a control for non-specific binding (Figure 3A). In the three cases after a single round of bio-panning the mixture recovered from the eluates contained T7-ATERF-1 as the major clone, representing up to 100% of the rescued phage. In contrast, the proportion of this clone recovered after bio-panning against agarose remained similar to the input mixture. Using the minimal input (1∶17) as the baseline, the ratio between input and rescued phage was used to assess for the maximal enrichment in T7-ATERF-1 that could be detected after one round of selection. The three strains resulted in significant and more-than-10-fold enrichment. To exclude the possibility that a mutation in the phage particle rather than the phage-displayed polypeptide itself was responsible for increased binding, recombinant (r) ATERF-1 protein was added to the cells during bio-panning. The addition of rATERF1 reduced recovery of T7-ATERF-1 clone to less than 40% (Figure 3B). This suggests that rATERF-1 can compete with the T7-ATERF-1 polypeptide for the binding, resulting in less T7-ATERF-1 phage bound to the cells during bio-panning. These results support the assertion that ATERF-1 protein binds selectively to Pseudomonas cells. This binding is likely through a bacterial component common to the three strains, since panning against all of them resulted in a significant increase of the T7-ATERF-1 clone in rescued phage. To further demonstrate the specificity of T7-ATERF-1 binding, a Gram (+) bacteria was used as the substrate for competitive bio-panning under identical conditions than Pseudomonas strains (Figure 3C), and was found unable to produce significant enrichment. Since LPS is a MAMP common to all Gram (−) bacteria and it has been demonstrated that induces expression of a high number of defence-related genes in A. thaliana [5], bio-panning was also performed against immobilised bacterial LPS (Figure S2A). Although bio-panning against LPS resulted in a considerable enrichment in recovered T7-ATERF1 phage, t-test comparison produced high p-values and the result was considered non significant.10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.g003Figure 3Competitive bio-panning assay shows specific binding of T7-ATERF-1 clone to the three strains of Pseudomonas. (A) Competition between T7-ATERF-1 phage (which expresses ATERF-1 polypeptide) and T7-C1 (competing phage randomly selected). Mixtures of phage containing 1∶1 (input 1), 1∶6 (input 2) and 1∶17 (input 3) proportions of T7-ATERF-1:T7-C1 clones were prepared to a final concentration of 6.3×109 pfu/ml. Phage mixtures were panned against 1 OD of Pa, Pst, Pst(avrRpt2) (avr) or agarose (Agar) under the same conditions used for T7LAtPa and T7LAtPs libraries. The bar series show the percentage of T7-ATERF-1 clone in the input and in the eluates that were recovered after one round of selection. The numbers below the bars represent the fold enrichment for T7-ATERF-1, calculated as the ratio between eluate and input percentages. Asterisks indicate significant differences (t-test, p<0.05) respect to the agarose (non-specific binding) control. (B) Addition of rATERF-1 protein inhibits binding of T7-ATERF-1 phage to Pst cells. Bacteria were incubated with 10 µg of rATERF-1 (+) or rLacZ (−) during panning with a 1∶10 mixture (input) of T7-ATERF-1:T7-C1 phage. Recovery of T7-ATERF-1 in the eluates was significantly decreased (p<0.05) when rATERF-1 was added to the cells. (C) Competition between T7-ATERF-1 and T7-C1 clone for binding to Pa, Pst or Enterococcus faecalis (Ef). The percentage of T7-ATERF-1 phage recovered from bio-panning with the Gram(+) bacterium was not significantly different from the input (p = 0.1835), whereas eluates recovered from Pseudomonas sp. bio-pannings were enriched in T7-ATERF-1 clone (Pa p = 0.0086 and Pst p = 0.0021). A similar competition assay was performed for the clone T7-ATUBA1 (Figure S2B), but the maximal enrichment that could be measured in this case was 1.7-fold. Thus, we focused our next studies in the in vivo interactions of ATERF-1 protein during bacterial infection.5 ATERF-1 is exported from the nucleus after challenge with Pseudomonas Since the in vivo localization of ATERF-1 is predicted to be nuclear, the binding to bacterial components as was suggested by our competition assay is expected to take place in the nucleus as well. Bacterial MAMPs and effectors are usually perceived by plant receptors located in the plasma-membrane or internalized through the endocytic pathway to signal pathogen presence from different subcellular localisations [34]; however, very few nuclear proteins have been involved in bacterial MAMP/effector-binding [35], [36]. To determine the subcellular localization of ATERF-1, a translational fusion to the Green Fluorescent Protein (35S:GFP-ATERF-1) was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 (pGV2260) and infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves, allowing transient expression of GFP-ATERF1. The RFP-H2B reporter line, which expresses nuclear Red Fluorescent Protein, was used in this study to visualize co-localization with GFP-ATERF-1. As expected, the localization of ATERF-1 in non-treated plants was clearly nuclear (Figure 4 and 5). However, when leaves were infiltrated with Pa, Pst or Pst(avrRpt2) strains, GFP-ATERF-1 appeared in extra-nuclear localisations, compressed against the plasma membrane. Mock treatment failed to induce extra-nuclear localisation of GFP-ATERF-1, which indicates that the nuclear export is induced by the presence of bacteria rather than the wounding damage. Moreover, infiltration with heat-killed strains also resulted in extra-nuclear localisation (only shown for Pst(avrRpt2) strain), suggesting that translocation does not require metabolically active bacteria. Cytoplasmic localisation of GFP-ATERF-1 after infiltration of Pst strain was confirmed by western-blot analysis in transgenic A. thaliana plants (Figure 5C).10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.g004Figure 4GFP-ATERF-1 localisation after inoculation with Pseudomonas strains.

Photographs were taken 3–5 h. after the inoculation.10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.g005Figure 5Comparison between nuclear and extra-nuclear GFP-ATERF-1 in non-infected and Pst infected plants.

(C) Western-blot detection of GFP protein in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions from 35S:GFP-ATERF-1 transgenic plants of A. thaliana. Plants were expossed to mock or Pst infection and their protein extracts were separated in nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions. The fractions were resolved in SDS-PAGE gels, blotted and probed against anti GFP antibodies to detect the 75 KDa, GFP-ATERF-1 fusion protein. Membranes were re-probed with anti-H3 histone (H3, nuclear) and anti RuBisCo (RbcL, cytoplasmic) antibodies.6 Mutant aterf-1 shows increased susceptibility to Pst infection To gain further insight into the role of ATERF-1 in plant defence, we examined the susceptibility phenotype of a loss-of-function, aterf-1 mutant upon infection with P. syringae. A series of bioassays were performed in which leaves of Col-0 wild-type and aterf-1 plants were infiltrated with the Pst strain and disease symptoms developed on their surfaces were compared (Figure 6A, B and C). The number of leaves that displayed extensive chlorotic lesions was much higher in the aterf-1 mutant than in the Col 0 (Figure 6B), and the Disease Index indicated a highly significant difference between both genotypes (Figure 6C). A different type of bioassay measured the in planta growth of the Pst bacteria at different times post-infection (Figure 6D); in accordance with the symptoms developed by the plant, bacterial growth was significantly higher in the aterf-1 mutant. These results demonstrate that the ATERF-1 gene product is required in vivo for a proper defence response to Pst infection.10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.g006Figure 6aterf-1 mutant shows increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. (A) Macroscopic symptoms of disease caused by inoculation of Pst strain into the leaves of Col-0 and aterf-1 mutant. (B) Rossette leaves of 5-week-old plants were inoculated with a Pst suspension in series of 8 plants per genotype. Disease symptoms (3 days post-inoculation) were rated on 75–88 leaves/genotype comparing leaves of similar developmental state. The following disease severity classes were established: I, 0–10% of leaf surface as a chlorotic lesion, II, 10–50% of leaf surface, and III, >50% of leaf surface. The percentage of leaves falling in each category is represented with the number of scored leaves inside the bars (C) Disease Index (DI) was calculated for each genotype according to the formula DI = (0n1+1n2+2n3)/Nt where n1–n3 is the number of leaves in the I, II or III classes and Nt is the total number of leaves collected from one plant. Asterisk indicates significant differences respect to the wild-type genotype with a p = 3.15×10−6 (t-test) (D) Bacterial titre in Pst-inoculated leaves at 3 and 4days post-inoculation (dpi). Bars represent the average cfu/cm2 leaf surface and error bars represent SD. Asterisks indicate significant difference between genotypes (p<0.01), which was observed in two independent bioassays.7 Systematic identification of selected clones by microarrays Next, we developed a microarray-based strategy to allow for systematic identification and quantification of clones selected by bio-panning. Clones shown in table 2 were easily isolated since they were present at high frequency in the bio-panned eluates, which contained as much as 8.6×107 pfu (Figure 2A). However, the identification of less frequent but still valuable clones requires large-scale analysis. The isolation of individual pfu and the sequencing of their cDNA inserts is a time-consuming and expensive procedure when large number of clones needs to be analysed. On the other hand, although redundancy of a clone after bio-panning suggests affinity selection, a clone that was already very frequent in the initial library would be also expected at high frequency after a random selection. Therefore, the abundance of a clone before and after bio-panning should be compared to determine the enrichment yield after selection. To this end, we used Arabidopsis, two-colour microarray probes to rapidly quantify the copy number of each cDNA insert before and after bio-panning. The inserts contained in the libraries (L) or in the bio-panned eluates (B, rounds 1 to 5) were PCR-amplified, labelled with Alexa 555 or 647 fluorochromes and hybridized to Quiagen AROS Version 3 microarrays. The signals from the T7LAtPa or T7LAtPs libraries were used as the reference colour channel and 4 replicates were performed for each B versus L comparison in order to provide error estimations for the statistical analysis. Normalized values from all the probes are provided in supplemental datasets S3–S5.7.1 Significance analysis of P. aeruginosa bio-panning Significance analysis of microarrays was performed with GeneSpring software using the t-test against 0. This analysis provided p- and fold-change values for each gene spotted on the microarray, which are fully listed in S6 dataset. The dataset is represented as a plot in Figure 7. To select for genes with maximal fold-change after selection but significant p-values we used a cut-off plus multiple testing correction. Since stringency of multiple testing corrections depends on how many genes are tested, a first cut-off on fold-change (>|±1.45|) and p-value (<0.1) was used to reduce the number of tests, and 806 genes were pre-selected for correction (Table 3). From here genes with negative fold-change (genes that were selected against during the bio-panning) were removed and then False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction was applied to define a final set of 101 candidates with corrected p<0.05 (S7, S10).10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.g007Figure 7Microarray analysis of the Pa bio-panning, significance vs. fold-change plot. cDNA from the T7LAtPa library (L) and the clones selected after bio-panning (B) was hybridized to AROS microarrays. For each gene spotted in the microarray the B/L ratio and the statistical significance of B/L≠1 were determined. The plot represents the B/L ratio as a fold-change in the Y-axis (log values centred around 1) and the p-values for the statistical test in the X-axis. Genes with highest fold-change (maximum enrichment after bio-panning selection) and lowest p-value represent the best candidates as Pseudomonas-bound clones.10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.t003Table 3Microarray selection of three sets of 101 (Pa), 153 (avr) and 318 (Pst) genes with significant fold-change after bio-panning.Bio-panned libraryBio-panning substrateBio-panning roundGenes with |FC|>1.45 and p<0.1Genes that pass FDR correctionT7LAtPaPa5B806101T7LAtPsavr1B121312B4881223B1091B U 2B U 3B31 U 122 U 9 = 153Pst1B5311712B3741423B24171B U 2B U 3B171 U 142 U 17 = 318 FC Fold Change, FDR False Discovery Rate.7.2 Significance analysis of P. syringae bio-panning The fold-change and p-value for each gene were calculated from the t-test as described for P. aeruginosa microarrays (full list in S6). In this case we observed that in rounds 1 and 2 the genes with highest fold-changes were concentrated around the lowest p-values, whereas in the 3rd round fold-changes were more evenly distributed along the p-value axe (Figure 8). In addition, fold-changes in the 1st and 2nd rounds were overall higher than in the 3rd round of selection. Thus, the best candidates (maximal fold-change with the minimal p-value) were already defined in rounds 1 and 2. Consequently, we delimited the final set of candidates taking into account microarray data generated during the 3 rounds of selection. The genes that passed the FDR correction in at least one round of bio-panning defined two sets of 153 and 318 genes from Pst(avrRpt2) and Pst strains respectively (Table 3 and S8, S9, S10).10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.g008Figure 8Microarray analysis shows significant fold-changes in rounds 1 and 2 of Pst and Pst(avrRpt2) (avr) bio-pannings. cDNA from the T7LAtPs library (L) and the clones selected after bio-panning rounds 1, 2 or 3 (1B, 2B or 3B) were hybridized to microarrays. For each gene spotted in the microarray the B/L ratio and the statistical significance of B/L≠1 were determined. The plot represents the B/L ratio as a fold-change in the Y-axis (log values centred around 1) and the p-values for the statistical test in the X-axis. Best candidates to be Pseudomonas-bound clones are represented by the spots with highest fold-change and lowest p-values, which are located on the top-left area of the graph.7.3. Overlapping of significant gene sets The 101-, 153- and 318-gene sets define three groups of phage clones for which copy number was significantly increased after bio-panning with Pa, Pst(avrRpt2) and Pst strains respectively. The union of the three sets contains 472 genes which represent potential MAMP/effector-interacting proteins. The overlapping among sets is shown in Figure 9A. As expected, the two strains of P. syringae shared a large number of genes (95), whereas Pa shared only 5 genes with the Pst strain, 2 of them common to Pst(avrRpt2). Three subsets of 96, 58 and 220 genes remained specific for Pa, Pst(avrRpt2) and Pst strains respectively. The genes in each subset are listed in S11–S16. We inspected the lists to identify in-frame clones already sequenced in table 2. Since the microarray probe for ATERF-1 is located at the very N-terminus of the predicted protein, this probe does not cover the fragment that is present in the T7-ATERF-1 clone, and therefore the clone could not be identified by hybridisation to microarrays. However the lists includes AtSP7 (At1g66740) as a top-represented gene (see complete list of fold-change values in S6) and RBCS1A (At1g67090). Both genes were identified by sequence analysis of the dominant clones rescued after bio-panning. Thus, our significance analysis confirmed in-frame proteins identified through the first approach to characterize Pseudomonas-bound clones. The 472-gene set also contained 23 targets (S17) that produced immune interactions in the Plant-Pathogen Immune Network-1 (PPIN-1) [18], including RBCS1A.10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.g009Figure 9Overlapping and categorisation of the gene sets defined by significance analysis of microarray data. (A) The analysis identified 3 sets of genes: 101, 153 and 318 genes were selected after bio-panning against Pa, Pst(avrRpt2) (avr) and Pst strains respectively. The sets are represented as overlapping Venn diagrams and the number of shared genes is shown in the intersections. The union of the 3 sets produces a total of 472 genes as candidate MAMP/effector ligands. The positions of At1g66740 (AtSP7), At1g67090 (RBCS1A) and At5g47220 (ATERF-2) are shown in each set. Gene products that produced immune interactions in PPIN-1 are represented by coloured dots. (B) Genes in the 472-gene set were annotated according to the GO categories for Biological Process and the percentage of annotations falling in each category (in bold) was compared to the percentage produced by the 26,303 genes spotted on the microarray (in brackets). Categories with significant (p<0.01) over-representation are shown by asterisks. The 472 genes were grouped into broad functional categories based on the GO hierarchy. The percentage of genes falling in each category was compared between this set and the whole set of genes in the microarray (26,303 genes, Figure 8B). The 472 gene-set was significantly enriched in genes falling in the categories of response to abiotic/biotic stimulus and response to stress (12% and 10% in the 472-gene set compared to 5% and 6% in the microarray respectively). This analysis confirmed that the 472 genes are not a random selection from the microarray gene-set and include a significantly increased number of representatives for biological categories consistent with a role as immune targets.8 Defence-related genes in the significant sets identified by microarays Genes falling in the broad categories of response to biotic/abiotic stimulus or stress response were inspected to find the best candidates for MAMPs/effector targets. The genes annotated as defence-related in the fine GOslim classification were listed apart (Table 4). This list includes different molecular families involved in plant immunity, some of which are discussed next.10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.t004Table 4Significant genes falling in the GO fine category of “defence response”.Gene setGene IDSub set1B FC2B FC3B FC5B FCDescription101 PaAt1g0934096---5.4CRB CHLOROPLAST RNA BINDING protein, putativeAt3g0472096---5.1PR4 PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 4At3g1101096---3.0RLP34 Receptor like protein 34 (LRR-containing N-terminal domain, type 2)At5g4722096---2.9ATERF-2 ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 2At4g2367096---2.5Major latex protein-relatedAt2g31880*96---1.7LRR transmembrane protein kinase, putative153 avrAt1g24020931.42.2−1.2-MLP-like protein 423At3g28930581.01.6−1.3-AIG2 AVRRPT2-INDUCED GENE 2At1g63870*58−1.01.5−1.1-Disease resistance protein (TIR-NBS-LRR class), putativeAt5g0632058−1.2−1.01.5-NHL3 NDR1/HIN1-like 3At3g2785093−1.43.11.0-RPL12-C RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN318 PstAt1g24020933.9−1.1−1.0-MLP-like protein 423At1g792102202.5−1.01.1-20S proteasome alpha subunit BAt3g212202202.1−1.21.1-ATMKK5 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE KINASE 5At1g52660*2201.9−1.41.4-Disease resistance protein, putative (NB-ARC, LRR type 3)At4g238102201.9−1.2−1.0-WRKY53 transcription factorAt2g152202201.51.2−1.0-Plant basic secretory protein (BSP) family proteinAt3g27850931.5−3.3−1.5-RPL12-C RIBOSOMAL PROTEINAt5g53890*2201.01.91.3-LRR transmembrane protein kinase, putativeAt1g19610220−0.91.51.2-LCR78/PDF1.4 Low-MW-cysteine rich 78At2g43530220−2.53.82.0-Trypsin inhibitor, putative FC Fold change, 1 to 5 rounds of bio-panning (1B to 5B). Predicted LRR-containing proteins are marked in bold, asterisks indicate immune-related baits tested by Muhktar et al. The most represented family of proteins in Table 4 is the group of LRR receptors [37], with 5 representatives. From them, At2g31880 has been previously reported as a flagellin-responsive gene. At2g31880 expression is elicited by flagellin or Pseudomonas infection and activates defence responses through a signalling pathway that is repressed by BIR1, a negative regulator of BAK1 [38], [39]. BAK1 and its partner FLS2 are themselves LRR-containing receptors that signal pathogen presence by interacting with flagellin [40], [41] but also with pathogen-derived effectors like AvrPto [42], [43]. Our data suggest that the mechanism by which At2g31880 activates defence involves the binding between the encoded protein and a Pseudomonas-derived molecule, which could also be in the basis of BIR1 inhibitory action. The table also includes 2 genes encoding for nuclear proteins: ATERF-2 (At5g47220) and WRKY53 (At4g23810). ATERF-2 is the closer homologe to ATERF-1 and both transcription factors share extensive similarity within and outside the ERF domain [30], [32]. WRKY53 is a positive regulator of basal resistance triggered by virulent pathogens/MAMPs and is tightly regulated at various levels, i.e., its interaction with the MEKK1 kinase that signals pathogen infection [44], [45]. This mechanism is a short cut to directly activate WRKY53-controlled genes upon pathogen infection, which shows that transcription factors involved in plant defence have evolved several check-points to sense pathogen attack. AIG2 (At3g28930) and NHL3 (At5g06320) are in the subset of genes that were specifically identified after bio-panning with Pst(avrRpt2) strain (58-gene subset). AIG2 was one of the first genes isolated that exhibited RPS2- and avrRpt2-dependent transcript induction early after infection with P. syringae strains carrying avrRpt2 [46]. Although its function remains unknown, the protein structure suggests that AIG2 can bind small ligands in a hydrophilic cavity as a part of its active site [47]. NHL3 encodes for a plasma membrane protein responsive to P. syringae infection which has been proposed to function as an R receptor for Avr proteins [48]. In the Pst-specific group (220-gene subset) there are 8 genes previously annotated as defence-related. At1g79210 encodes for an endopeptidase which forms part of the 26S proteasome complex and accumulates differentially in response to inoculation with Pst or avrRpm1 strains [49]. At3g21220 encodes for the AtMKK5 kinase. This protein has been shown able to interact directly with the HopF2 effector of P. syringae and interfere with MAMP-triggered immunity [50]–[52]. At1g19610 and At2g43530 are included in the defensin family of proteins [53]. Defensins bind strongly to microbial surfaces as a first step to exert they antimicrobial function [54], and so they are good candidates to be rescued by affinity bio-panning. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on a number of these genes to validate our microarray analysis (Figure 10). Defence-related and top-regulated genes selected from the significant subsets of Pa (PR4 and ATERF-2), Pst(avrRpt2) (AtSP7 and At1g08930) and Pst (RBCS1A) bio-panning analysis were tested, as well as ATERF-1. qRT-PCR confirmed a significant enrichment of these genes after bio-panning selection in all the cases.10.1371/journal.pone.0054654.g010Figure 10Quantification of microarray-selected candidates by qRT-PCR. Relative abundance of each gene was measured before selection in the libraries (T7LAtPa or T7LAtPs) and after bio-panning selection in the eluates (1 to 3 or 5B). Columns represent normalized values from 3 replicas respect to an internal sequence in the T7-Select10 3b vector. All the genes were over-represented after selection, with significant p-values.Discussion Phage display is a powerful technique that allows for the expression of a large number of proteins on viral particles and their selection on the basis of their binding affinity for a ligand. In this study we used the technique to perform a high-throughput selection of Arabidopsis proteins with affinity for Pseudomonas bacteria and therefore with a putative role in natural plant-microbe interactions. Phage-display-based strategies have been shown before suitable for the selection of plant proteins with physiological ligands [55], [56], but to date no attempts to use them in a wide screening of plant immunity targets have been reported. To provide input for this selection we constructed two phage-displayed libraries covering different fractions of the plant immune transcriptome. To identify the output we took advantage of microarray development in Arabidopsis and coupled microarrays to phage display in a novel tool for research. This innovative approach stood for the quantification of all putative binders in a genome-wide scale and provided a significant list of candidate targets for MAMPs and virulence effectors. Clone identification is the last and less efficient step of phage display, and only recently has been addressed by using high-throughput technologies [21]. Three different plant-pathosystems were used as a cDNA source for the construction of the libraries. In the Arabidopsis vs. Pst pathosystem, infection with the bacterium results in a compatible interaction and induces de transcription of a large number of plant genes [31], [57]. Infection with the Pst(avrRpt2) strain elicits the HR response in hosts that recognize the AvrRpt2 protein and results in incompatible interaction. The use of P. aeruginosa in the third pathosystem has additional interest since this bacterium is an opportunistic pathogen of humans with an extended range of hosts [58]. P. aeruginosa PA14 strain is a hypervirulent isolate that produces pyonacin and other factors of virulence both for mammalian and plant hosts [24], [27], [28]. The three strains share MAMPs common to most Gram-negative bacteria, like LPS or flagellin, and secrete virulence factors some of which are able to subvert host defences activated by MAMPs. Recently, it was shown that P. aeruginosa is able to evade immune recognition of flagellin through a similar mechanism in mammals and plants [59]. Unlike P. syringae, this bacterium has not evolved to be nutritionally dependent of a plant host [26]. Thus, these 3 pathosystems represent different degrees in the specificity of the plant-microbe interaction during which the host response might involve a broad range of molecules that recognize, signal and neutralise MAMPs and/or virulence effectors. As the vector for phage display expression we used T7, since display in the lytic phage can produce libraries of greater diversity than M13. According to our estimations in Table 1 and S1 the T7LAtPs library constructed in this study represents virtually the entire AtORFeome. Our determination of phage numbers in the primary library was based on pfu-counting; however quantification by real-time PCR provides estimations 5 to 10 times higher [21]. Thus, the actual coverage of these libraries might be higher than reported here. Since the average size of cloned fragments ranges from 0.2 to 1.5 or 2.2 kb, full-length cDNAs should be represented to some extent, although N-terminal domains are under-represented as observed from Table 2. The screening of 6.3×109 pfu that we performed for each pan represents every possible cDNA in the most complex, T7LatPs library with a multiplicity of 100. This allows sufficient sequence representation to find rare cDNAs during selection. The next step in our strategy involved the selection of affinity clones by bio-panning against a living substrate. Living cells like zoospores or cultured cell lines [60], [61] have been bio-panned against peptide libraries. We used bacterial cells that were pre-incubated with plants to ensure the expression of effectors induced only upon host contact. To follow the enrichment in affinity clones we monitored the titres of eluates during successive rounds of selection (Figure 1). When bio-panning high-affinity antibodies titres usually increase up to a maximum that indicates the round from which eluted clones should be analysed. The selection and amplification of the clones bound in the first round results in increasing titres in later rounds, but once the eluates are saturated for affinity-binding clones titres plateau since no further selection happens and clones amplify similarly. This is not necessary observed when selecting for low-affinity interactions where clones compete weakly for binding to the substrate. In our case, the iteration of pannings against bacteria but not against the agarose control resulted in titres that were increased 102–103 times respect to the first round. This is a significant increase, similar to values reported for antibody libraries. However, maximum titres of rounds 5th and 3rd did not remain stationary, suggesting that bio-panning was not driven to saturation. The point of maximum enrichment for affinity-binding clones depends on the complexity of the library and the requirements of each displayed protein vs. substrate interaction, since phage selected in one round compete to each other in different proportion during the next round. In our bio-panning we introduced an additional level of complexity because bacterial cells can display many different ligands for selection at the same time. The analysis of the dominant clones isolated from rounds with titration peaks (Figure 2 and Table 3) was relevant since the T7-ATERF-1 clone confirmed its binding properties in the competition assay. However, the isolation of a clone at high frequency in a particular round of bio-panning does not imply enrichment during selection. Microarrays allow for the quantification of the differences in the copy number of each clone during selection (B vs. L fold change), which can provide an absolute measurement for enrichment. In our study, B vs. L fold-changes, were monitored across the first 3 rounds of bio-panning with T7LAtPs library, and this provided additional data about the kinetics of selection. From significance vs. fold-change plots in Figure 7 the clones with lowest p-value and highest fold-change appeared in the first and second rounds of selection; therefore we included these data in the significance analysis (Table 3). The S6 dataset summarizes the most relevant information produced by our genome-wide analysis: for each gene spotted in the microarray a fold-change value is provided plus its associated significance level. We choose significance analysis of microarrays as a supervised statistical procedure to define the best candidates, but a variety of methods are available for microarray selection that can be applied to our supplemental data. The significance analysis defined a total of 472 genes with significant fold-changes (Table 3), distributed in overlapping sets. The 101 gene-set (Pa) was selected from a different input (T7LAtPa library) and the low overlapping with the other two sets might be due to the lower coverage of this library. However, gene sets arising from Pst and Pst(avrRpt2) bio-pannings are comparable since both were selected from the same input (T7LAtPs). Thus the high overlapping between them (Figure 9A, 95 shared genes) likely reflects common targets for the two P. syringae strains. Mining of data in S10 might provide additional information about the specificity of the interaction with the three bacterial strains tested in his study, although interpretation about the biological relevance of these interactions during in planta defence response should be cautious. Overall, the 472-gene set represents a microarray selection of candidate genes based on the microbe-binding properties of their phage-displayed proteins. Further validation of individual candidates picked from the set is necessary to confirm their importance as immune targets. A global study of the categories represented in the 472-gene set indicated over-representation of biological processes that are consistent with a role of the selected genes as putative targets for MAMPs or virulence effectors (Figure 9B). In addition, the comparison with previously published, transcript profiling datasets [31], [57] revealed that at least 120 genes in this set are also regulated at the transcriptional level during the in vivo response of the plant to bacteria (S17). A finer inspection through GO hierarchy detected 19 defence-related genes with very different molecular functions, discussed in detail in section 8. At least one of them (At3g21220) encodes for an in vivo-validated target of a bacterial effectors. Moreover, the 472-gene set contains 23 immune targets (S18) confirmed by protein interactome analysis [18] which are also very diverse in their molecular roles. NB-LRR disease resistance proteins are represented (At1g52660), but also metabolic enzymes validated by our sequence analysis (At1g67090) and transcription factors like SNZ (At2g39250), in the family of AP2-ERF DNA-binding proteins, or AtTCP15 (At1g69690). The latter was able to interact with several groups of Avr and Hop effectors from Pseudomonas syringae used as baits for the PPIN-1 map. These results demonstrated that microarray hybridization plus significance analysis provide an efficient method for wide identification of putative targets. Since hybridisation does not pre-require isolation of clones, this approach is fast and produces information for many genes. However, clone isolation facilitates frame analysis and further characterization of the binding properties of selected protein. We used the T7-ATERF-1 clone isolated from bio-panned eluates to validate our selection strategy and investigated the role of ATERF-1 during plant-defence. The binding of T7-ATERF-1 to the 3 strains of Pseudomonas was compared and we found that, in addition to Pa, Pst strains also produced significant enrichments in recovered phage, whereas a Gram (+) bacterium did not (Figure 3). This suggested that the bacterial ligand for ATERF-1 is a molecule present in the 3 strains of Pseudomonas rather than a strain-specific virulence factor. In accordance, the nuclear translocation of GFP-ATERF-1 protein was promoted equally by the 3 strains (Figure 4). Inoculation with heat-killed bacteria induced the same translocation effect, whereas a mock solution without bacteria failed to change subcellular location of the protein. Thus, translocation from the nucleus does not require the signals produced by living bacteria in the plant apoplast, and is not induced by wounding signals associated to inoculation. Although our results do not imply that the binding of a bacterial ligand to ATERF-1 causes the exportation from the nucleus, the two phenomena share common features. Bacterial effectors like PopP2 can interact with host proteins to modulate their nuclear localisation [35], [62]. In an effort to go deeper into the physiological role of ATERF-1, we assessed the resistance of an aterf-1 mutant against P. syringae infection (Figure 6). The sensitive phenotype indicates that ATERF-1 is required for a proper immune response and other defence mechanisms induced during natural response to the bacterium are not able to compensate for its effect. The ERF family of transcription factors is very redundant and loss-of-function mutants do not usually exhibit susceptible phenotypes [63]. In contrast to other members of the family [64]–[66], the expression of ATERF-1 is induced not only by ethylene, but also by flg22 treatment and Pst infection [31], [57]. However, the transcriptional response to Pst is stronger than that to flg22 or ethylene alone [31]. According to these authors, this would indicate that ethylene basal response is insufficient to prevent Pst pathogenesis or that Pst is able to block ethylene signalling or responses downstream ATERF-1 induction. Considering our results, it is tempting to speculate that a Pseudomonas ligand can be internalized into the nucleus where interacts with ATERF-1 to release transcriptional regulation by this factor. The finding that ATERF-1 activity is both sensitive to ethylene and pathogen-derived molecules suggests that the long-distance control of defence response by hormones and direct sensing of pathogen molecules can be integrated through the same transcription factor. Although classically transcription factors have not been considered as direct binders of the microbe-derived molecules that trigger immunity, there are recent examples of nuclear host proteins which are able to interact with bacterial factors [35], [67]. The RRS1-R protein from A. thaliana interacts with the Ralstonia solanacearum effector protein PopP2 in the nucleus of living plant cells [68]. RRS1-R is composed of two differentiated domains, with a DNA-binding motif which is characteristic of the Zin-finger class or WKRY transcription factors and a Toll/Interleukin receptor (TIR)-NBS-LRR-like domain for pathogen sensing. Similarly, ATERF-1 (At4g17500) is composed of a C-terminal domain with homology to the ERF-1 family of transcription factors plus an N-terminal extension which is not present in any other member of the family. The PPIN-1 interactome map revealed that transcriptional regulators represent the most enriched category in the subgroup of 165 putative effector targets [18]. The identification of a variety of immune targets as a result of our microarray analysis underscores the possibility that pathogen-sensing is a capacity retained in very different families of proteins that are involved in plant defence, from surface receptors to transcriptional regulators. Typical R proteins have a modular structure composed of different terminal domains in addition to their central NB-LRR region. This structure facilitates a tight regulation of their activity, which is accomplished by intramolecular interactions between the various domains [15]. The acquisition of pathogen-sensing domains during the evolution of structurally unrelated proteins would facilitate the integration of defence responses in the complex immune system of the plant.Materials and MethodsMicrobial strains Pseudomonas aeuriginosa PA14 strain is a hyper-virulent isolate that was kindly provided by Prof. F. Ausubel (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA). Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 strain (Pst; wild-type, Rifr) and the avrRpt2 strain containing the pV288 plasmid [29] were generous gifts from Dr. Jens Boch (Martin Luther Universitat, Halle, Germany). Enterococcus faecalis was provided through the CECT Spanish Collection of Culture Types. Escherichia coli DH5α (F− recA ΔlacU169(π80 lacZΔM15) endA hsdR gyrA) was obtained from Dr. F. Fierro (Universidad de Leon, Leon, Spain) and BLT5103 and BL21 (F− ompT gal [dcm][lon] hsdSB) strains from Novagen. Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 strains containing the pGV2260 or the pCH32 plasmid are described in [69]. Unless otherwise noted, bacteria were grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg/ml), kanamycin, rifampicin or gentamicin (50 µg/ml) when appropriate.Plant materials Arabidopsis thaliana accession Columbia-0 (Col-0) is the genetic background used in this work. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 20% bleach and 0.05% Tween-20 for 90 s and washed five times in sterile water before sowing. Seeds were stratified for 3 days at 4°C and then sown on Petri dishes containing Murashige and Skoog medium (MS basal salts, 2–3% (w/v) glucose, 0.6% (w/v) agar pH 5.7). Plates were sealed and incubated in a controlled environment growth chamber. Seven- to ten-day-old seedlings were transferred to individual test-tubes containing 5 ml of liquid MS or sown on pots containing a sterile mixture 3∶1 soil-vermiculite and grown in the greenhouse with 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod. Plants used for the bioassay with P. syringae were sown in autoclaved sand and grown in a controlled-environment chamber at 21°C, 70% relative humidity and 200 µM×m2/s of cool white fluorescence illumination (10-h light/14-h dark). After 10 days, germinated seedlings were transferred individually to 60-ml pots containing sterile soil-sand mixture (12∶5 v/v) [70]. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown in the greenhouse at 22°C and 16-h light/8-h dark cycle.Infection of plants with bacterial strains For infection with Pa, 25-day-old plants grown in liquid MS were inoculated with OD600 = 0.02 as previously described [28]. Infected plants were incubated into a growth chamber at 30°C and 90 rpm, under long-day light conditions. For infection with P. syringae 4-week-old plants growing in pots were infected with OD600 = 0.002 of bacteria by using the vacuum infiltration procedure [71]. For aterf-1 bioassays, series of eight 5-week-old plants were inoculated with OD600 = 0.0005 from an overnight culture (resuspended in 10 mM MgSO4). Bacteria were introduced in 4–5 rossette leaves per plant by pressure infiltration [69]. At 3 and 4 days post inoculation (dpi), leaves were classified by similar developmental state and disease symptom severity was scored using a scale consisting of three classes of lesions: 1 (0–10% of the leaf surface with necrotic lesions), 2 (10–50%), 3 (>50%). Disease index (DI) was calculated for each plant using the three-grade scale according to the formula: DI = (0n1+1n2+2n3)/Nt where n1–n3 is the number of leaves in the indicated class and Nt is the total number of leaves collected from one plant. To determine bacterial concentration in infected leaves, series of 8 plants per genotype and time point were inoculated in rosette leaves as before and the most developed leaves were collected to quantify bacterial titre by homogenizing 2 leaf discs (6 mm diameter) per plant in 400 µl of 10 mM MgSO4. Serial dilutions of this homogenate were plated on selective KB medium (2% Protease peptone, 0.15% MgSO4-7H2O, 0.2% KH2PO4, 1% Glycerol, 1.2% Agar and 25 µg/µl Rifampicin) and incubated for 48 h at room temperature before bacterial colonies were counted. Transgenic N. benthamiana plants expressing RFP:H2B and the 35S:GFP-ATERF-1 transient-expression construct were infected with OD600 = 0.02 of Pseudomonas bacteria 3–4 days post-agroinfiltration. Bacterial cultures were centrifuged, resuspended in 10 mM MgSO4 and injected with a syringe into the leaves. Boiled bacteria were heated 10 min at 100°C. After the infection plants were incubated 3 hours into a growth chamber and observed with a confocal microscope.Construction of T7 -phage-displayed libraries from Arabidopsis cDNA Plants were infected as described above and frozen in liquid nitrogen at different times post-inoculation (1 h, 3 h, 24 h, 48 h and 3–4 dpi to construct T7LAtPa library and 24 h, 48 h, 3 and 7 dpi for T7LAtPs libraries). For each time point, highly purified, total RNA was isolated from 5 g of frozen plants after homogenization with a micro-dismembrator (Braunn) as described previously [72]. mRNA was isolated from 400 µg of pooled RNAs to represent the transcriptional response of the plant during a time-course infection. The cDNA was synthesized from 4 µg of mRNA using OrientExpress cDNA Synthesis Kit (Novagen) and 2 µg of T18V3N to prime synthesis. A mix 2∶1 of MMLV RT (Novagen) and SuperScript III (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize first strand cDNA. Second strand synthesis and end modification were performed as recommended in the manual. End-modified cDNAs were fractionated by gel filtration using the Mini Column Fractionation Kit (Novagen) and higher molecular weight fractions were used for ligation intoT7Select10-3b vector EcoRI/HindIII arms. Different ligations were performed and independently packaged to achieve optimal vector∶insert ratios. Each packaging reaction yielded a different sub-library that was analyzed in order to determine the percentage and the size of the cloned inserts. Final libraries were generated by combining the most representative sub-libraries and scaling the packaging process up. To calculate the number of primary recombinants, dilutions of the packaging reactions were mixed with E. coli BLT5403 and plated on LB+ampicillin plates as described in the T7-Select System Manual. After incubation at 37°C lysis plaques were counted to calculate phage titres, defined as pfu per unit volume. To determine the percentage of cDNA inserts cloned into the T7Select10-3b vector lysis plaques were transferred to a PCR mix and amplified with PIAG01 (5′ AGATTATCGCTAAGTACGC 3′) and T7ID (5′ GCAAGC(T)18 3′) primers; a minimum of 271 (T7LAtPa) or 358 (T7LAtPs) pfu were analysed by this method during the construction of the sub-libraries. Amplification, storage of the libraries and related procedures were performed as recommended by Novagen.Bio-panning selection Pseudomonas bacteria were grown to saturation in liquid LB and inoculated (OD600 = 0.16) into test tubes containing 10-days-old plants grown in 5 ml of liquid MS. Plants and bacteria were incubated together for 90 min without shaking at 30°C for P. aeruginosa or 25°C for P. syringae. Bacteria from 5 plants were recovered by gently rubbing the roots with a 1-ml tip containing MS. MS was then filtered through sterile Whatman paper to remove plant tissues. Bacteria were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 ml of the filtered MS before mixing them with 0.5 ml of LB containing 6.3×109 pfu of recombinant phage. Bio-panning was performed for 30 min in 1.5-ml microtubes within a hybridization oven at 25–30°C and 70 rpm. After this time, bacteria were centrifuged 1 min at 13.200 rpm and rinsed by vortexing 1 min in 1 ml TBST (Tris–buffered saline, Tween 0.005%) a total of 5 times. For elution, the bacterial pellet was resuspended by pipetting 3–5 times in 200 µl of elution buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7, SDS 1%). 100 µl of this solution were amplified immediately for the next bio-panning round in 50-ml cultures of E.coli BLT5403 and 100 µl were preserved in 1 ml of saline mixture (0.5 M NaCl) for titrating and further analyzes. For competitive bio-panning different input mixtures of T7-ATERF-1 or T7-ATUBA1 clones and T7-C1 control phage were prepared to a final concentration of 6.3×109 pfu/ml and panned under the same conditions described above. Input and eluted mixtures were simultaneously titred and replica-analyzed by PCR of 24 to 96 clones from each titration series. The inserts contained in the clones were amplified using PIAG01 and PIAG02 (5′ ATAGTTCCTCCTTTCAGC 3′) primers to yield a 200-bp band for T7-C1 and a 600-bp or 550-bp band for T7-ATERF-1 or T7-ATUBA1 clones, respectively. 2–3 independent pans were performed from each input mixture to provide the final error estimations. Non-specific binding controls were performed by replacing bacteria with an agarose solution at similar OD600. For the LPS-binding assay, purified LPS from P. aeruginosa serotype 1022 (SIGMA) was coupled to agarose using ABH (p-Azidodenzoyl hydrazide, Thermo Scientific) as a cross-linker. LPS was cross-linked to a final concentration of 2.5 mM, which simulates a living cell. Agarose-coupled LPS was used as the substrate for competitive bio-panning experiments with the T7-ATERF1:T7-C1 input mixtures instead of Pseudomonas living cells. Bio-panning with rATERF-1 or rLACZ proteins was carried out by resuspending Pst cell pellet in 500 µl of 0.1× Protein Elution Buffer, which contained 10 µg of freshly obtained, recombinant protein. After incubation at 25°C during 30 min to block ATERF-1-binding sites, cells were pelleted and resuspended in the phage mixture. Subsequent bio-panning was performed upon addition of 10 µg of recombinant protein to the cell/phage mixture, maintaining equivalent conditions of salinity (30 mM NaCl present in the 1× Protein Elution Buffer) and protein concentration (10 µg/ml) for incubations with rATERF-1 or rLacZ.PCR analysis, sequencing and clone rescue To monitor the enrichment in particular clones during bio-panning a specific PCR-procedure was used. Phage eluted after each round of selection were amplified to >109 pfu/ml and used to prepare high quality phage DNA by precipitation with 50% PEG 8000 (T7 Select-system Manual) and successive phenol extractions to remove phage capsid proteins. The cDNA amplicons contained in this clone mixture were amplified by PCR [94°C 2 min, 30×(94°C 30 s, 48°C 30 s, 68°C 3 min) 68°C 5 min] with PIAG01 and T7ID primers and Expand high fidelity polymerase (ROCHE). For individual-pfu analysis phage plaques were directly tipped into the PCR mix and analyzed with Taq (Invitrogen). For sequencing the PCR products were sub-cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and submitted to SISTEMAS GENOMICOS as DNA or colony plates when a large number of sequences were required. T7-ATERF-1 and T7-ATUBA1 clones rescued from the plates were amplified from eluates of Pa 5B round or Pst 3B round. Lysis plaques were picked with a sterile tip and kept in 100 µl of Phage Extraction Buffer (PEB, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgSO4). Aliquots of 1.5 µl were used for PCR amplification with PIAG01 as the common 5′ primer and T7-ATERF-1Rvs (5′ TCAACAACCTCGCACTTCAC 3′) or T7-ATUBA1Rvs (5′ AACGTAGGGCAGATGCAGAG 3′) as specific 3′ primers. Positive clones were amplified from PEB in 2 ml of BLT5403 (OD600 = 1) until cell lysis was observed and centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was re-amplified in 20 ml of bacterial culture under similar conditions. Lysates were filtered through a cellulose acetate filter (0.45 µm) and kept in 0.5 M NaCl.Labelling of cDNA inserts for microarray hybridization To generate microarray probes 100 ng of highly-purified phage DNA was amplified by PCR with the PIAG01 and T7ID primers. PCR was performed in 100 µl with 1.5 units of Expand High Fidelity Plus PCR (ROCHE) under the following cycles: 94°C 2 min, 30×(94°C 30 s, 48°C 30 s, 68°C 3 min) 68°C 5 min. The product of 5 PCR reactions was purified before labelling with QUIAquick PCR purification columns (QUIAGEN). Labelling was performed with Alexa 555 or 647 fluorochromes using 4 µg of PCR-amplified DNA and the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labelling System (Invitrogen).Microarray hybridization and analysis Arabidopsis Genome Oligo Set (AROS) Version 3 microarrays were provided by The University of Arizona. Microarrays were re-hydrated according to the manufacturer's instructions (http://ag.arizona.edu/microarray/methods.html) prior to hybridization. Microarrays were pre-hybridized and washed as previously described [73], and hybridized with 60 pmoles of each DNA-incorporated dye after denaturing in 90 ml of hybridization solution (50% formamide, 3× SSC, 1% SDS, 5% Denhard's reagent, 5% dextransulfate). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42°C in a Corning hybridization chamber immersed in a water bath. Labelled samples were co-hybridized on the same microarray as follows: T7LAtPa library (L) versus 5th bio-panning (5B) round with Pa (5BPavsL), T7LAtPs versus 3rd, 2nd or 1rst bio-panning round (3B, 2B or 1B) with Pst (3BPsvsL, 2BPsvsL or 1BPsvsL), T7LAPs versus 3rd, 2nd or 1rst bio-panning round with Pst(avrRpt2) (3BAvvsL, 2BAvvsL or 1BAvvsL). For each BvsL comparison 4 replica microarrays were hybridized swapping the dies of L and B labelled DNAs. Spot signals were captured using a confocal GeneChip scanner (BIO-RAD) and the Vers-Array software. Captured data were lowess-normalised, averaged and statistically analyzed following the workflow for two-colour experiments implemented in the GeneSpring GX Software (Agilent), with L signals used as the control channel for normalization. For significance analysis the GeneSpring t-test was used to determinate if the expression values (log B/L centred around 0) for each gene were significantly different from 0. The p-value from the t-statistics was computed asymptotically with n = 100 permutations. Filtering with volcano plots was performed on p-values (p<0.1) and absolute fold change (>|±1.45|) of 5BvsL for Pa bio-panning or 1BvsL, 2BvsL and 3BvsL for Pst(avrRpt2) and Pst bio-pannigs. Corrected p-values were calculated with the Benjamini and Hochberg FDR correction on the minimum set of genes selected after each comparison, ie. 276-gene set for Pa; 31, 122 or 9-gene sets (1B, 2B and 3B respectively) for Pst(avrRpt2); and 171, 142 or 17-gene sets (1B, 2B and 3B respectively) for Pst. Supplementary data are shown as exported from GeneSpring GX gene-lists under the corresponding experiment interpretation. Functional categorization was performed with the Gene Ontology tool at TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go). Comparisons with the PPIN-1 were performed by importing into GeneSpring a list of 841 genes from A. thaliana that produced immune interactions as described in [18]. For comparisons with the transcriptionally regulated genes reported by Truman et al. [57] or Thylmony et al [31] two lists of respectively 3,718 or 2,800 differentially regulated genes were imported and compared in Excel.qRT-PCR analysis High quality phage DNA from the eluates recovered after bio-panning selection was subjected to quantitative PCR in one StepOnePlus RT-PCR thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) by using the following primers for target genes: qAtSP7FW1 (5′ TGTTGGCAACTACCGCTTTG 3′), qAtSP7RV1 (5′ AGGCTCTTCCTTGAGTTGCTC 3′), qERD6FW1 (5′ TCTGCAATGGGTTTGAGTGC 3′), qERD6RV1 (5′ ACACAATGTGACCCAAGACG 3′), qRCBS1AFW1 (5′ AGCTTCACCGGTTAATTTCCC 3′), qRCBS1ARV1 (5′ CGCAAACCGGAAAACAAACG 3′), PR4FW1 (5′ GGCCATCTCATTGTTGACTACC 3′), qPR4RV1 (5′ CAATGGCCGAAACAAGCATG 3′), qATERF2FW1 (5′ TGGTGATGAGACACGTGTTG 3′), qATERF2RV1 (5′ CACGGGAACACTTTTACTTGGTG 3′), qATERF1FW1 (5′ AGCTAGGGTTTGGTTAGGAACG 3′), qATERF1RV1 (5′ ATTCAACAAAGCGCGGGAAC 3′). Primers qT7S10FW1 (5′ TGTTAAGCTGCGTGACTTGG 3′) and qT7S10RV1 (5′ TCACACCTGACTGGAATACGAC 3′) were used to amplify the internal control. Amplification was monitored by using the Brilliant® SYBR® Green QPCR MasterMix (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions. The thermal profile followed in these experiments was 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min and finally 50 s at 72°C. Quantification was repeated three times to get representative values for the slope of the standard curves and the standard deviation. The concentration of samples was calculated with the StepOnePlus RT-PCR software, which created threshold cycle values (Ct) and extrapolated relative levels of PCR product from the standard curve. The levels of PCR product for each tested gene were normalized against the internal control in the T7-Selelect 103B vector sequence. Bar graphs show normalized levels relative to the calibrator (PCR product detected in the libraries, before bio-panning selection) as log10 of the 2-ΔΔCt value.Isolation of the aterf-1 insertional mutant Seeds of the aterf-1 mutant (SALK_036267) were obtained from NASC. Plants homozygous for the T-DNA insertion were confirmed by PCR amplification using a T-DNA specific left border primer (T-DNA SALK Lba1, 5′ TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG 3′) and a forward ATERF-1-specific primer (ATERF-1-LPb, 5′ CGTCCATCTCATCCGAAAAT 3′). The amplicon confirmed the presence of the T-DNA insertion. The wild type ATERF-1 locus was identified by PCR amplification using ATERF-1 specific primers (ATERF-1-LPb and ATERF-1-RPb, 5′ CGTCGGAAGACGAAGAAGAC 3′). Loss-of-function was checked by Real Time-PCR using ACTIN8 as endogenous control for expression levels and the ATERF1 specific primers (qATERF1FW1 and qATERF1RV1) for the amplification.GFP fusions and Agrobacterium infiltration analysis ATERF-1 (At4g17500) full length cDNA was obtained from ABRC (U16643) and translationally fused to the C-terminal region of the GFP gene in the pMDC43 vector [74] by using the GATEWAY technology (Invitrogen). The resulting construct (35S:GFP-ATERF-1) was transformed into A. tumefaciens C58C1 strain carrying the pGV2260 plasmid, which delivered it into the leaf cells of RFP:H2B transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana. This transgenic line constitutively expresses red fluorescent protein (RFP) that is targeted to nuclei [75]. Simultaneous agro-infiltration with the pGV2260 and the pCH32-carrying strains was performed as described [76] to avoid gene silencing. Basically, Agrobacterium cells were resuspended in 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES pH 5.6 and 200 µM acetosyringone and infiltrated in tobacco leaves by using a 10 ml-syringe. After infiltration plants were maintained for 3–4 days in a growth chamber before exposure to Pseudomonas strains.Fluorescence microscopy The fluorescence photographs were taken with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope and Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 laser scanning confocal imaging system (LaserSharp v.5 Image software). For GFP and RFP detection, the excitation source was an argon ion laser at 488 nm and detection filters between 426–481 nm and 498–554 nm, respectively. Quantification of fluorescence was performed by using the Stack Profile tool of the Leica Application Suite AF Lite software (Version 2.3.5).Generation of transgenic Arabidopsis plants Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were transformed with OD600 = 0.8 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the construct 35S:GPF-ATERF1 by the floral dip method. Basically, 200 ml of the bacterial culture were grown at 28°C and 250 rpm, centrifuged 10 minutes at 7000 rpm and resuspended into 200 ml of transformation solution (MS medium, 5% sucrose, 4.4 µl BAP (500 µg/µl), 60 µl Silwet L-77). Flowers were dipped into the transformation solution and vacuum-infiltrated twice during 30 sec. Seeds from transformed plants were harvested and plated on Hygromicin selective MS medium (1% Sucrose, 0.3% Phytagel and 40 µg/ml of Hygromicin) to identify T1 transgenic plants. Approximately 100 of T2 seeds were plated on hygromicin-containing MS and transgenic lines with a 3∶1 (resistant∶sensitive) segregation ratio were selected. T3 progeny, homozygous for hygromicin resistance, was used for further studies. Gain-of-function was checked by Real Time-PCR using ACTIN8 as endogenous control for expression levels and the ATERF1 specific primers (qATERF1FW1 and qATERF1RV1) for the amplification.Subcellular fractionation and Western Blot analysis Rosette leaves from 4-week-old, 35S:GFP-ATERF1 plants were infiltrated with OD600 = 0.02 of Pst strain, harvested after 3–4 h and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Next, 10 g. of plant material were ground to fine powder by using a mortar and pestle and resuspended in 30 ml of NIB buffer (CelLytic™PN, SIGMA), 1 mM DTT. The suspension was filtered and centrifuged at 1260 g for 10 min. Pellets were completely resuspended in 1 ml of NIBA (1× NIB, 1 mM DTT and 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail), 0.3% TRITON X-100, and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected as the cytosolic fractions whereas pellets were washed in 1 ml of NIBA for crude nuclei preparation. Protein concentration for each fraction was determined by the Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Sixty µg of protein were loaded per well onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to an Inmobilon™-P PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in PBS-T containing 5% ECL Advance Blocking Agent (Amersham) and probed with anti-GFP monoclonal (JL-8) antibodies (Living Colors® A.v., Clontech). To monitor for the cleanness of fractions control blots were performed with antibodies against nuclear H3 histone (Abcam) or cytoplasmic RuBisCo-Large subunit (Agrisera). Membranes were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies (ECL-peroxidase, Amersham) and chemi-luminescence signals produced with the ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham). Signals were detected with the Intelligent Dark-Box II, LAS-1000 scanning system (Fujifilm).Production of recombinant ATERF-1 protein To produce rATERF-1 the full-length CDS of At4g17500 was PCR-up with the PETAT1Fw (5′ CACCATGTCGATGACGGCGGATTC 3′) and PETAT1Rv (5′ TCAAAATTATAAAACCAATAAACGATCGCC3′) primers and the pU16643 DNA as the template, to amplify an 817 bp fragment which was directionally cloned into pET100/D-TOPO expression vector (Champion™ pET Direccional TOPO Expression Kit, Invitrogen). The expression of recombinant protein was induced with 1 mM IPTG in BL21 Star™(DE3) cells of E. coli following the procedures recommended by Invitrogen. rLACZ was produced from the pET100/D/lacZ plasmid provided in the kit as the expression control. Purification of rATERF-1 or rLACZ proteins was performed in parallel under native condition, as recommended in Protino NI-IDA Columns user manual (Macherey-Nagel). Recombinant proteins were purified from the soluble fraction obtained after 24 h IPTG-induction and subsequent treatment of the cells with lysozyme (Macherey-Nagel). Both proteins were obtained with a similar purity and maximal concentration (0.2 mg/ml) from the 5th eluted fraction in 1× Protein Elution Buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole pH 8.0).Supporting InformationInformation S1 Gene elements spotted on A. thaliana microarrays that were detected in T7LAtPs and T7LATPa libraries.

Findings indicate that saffron extract has antioxidant properties but its underlying beneficial effects on diabetic encephalopathy were unclear. In the present study, the protective activities of saffron were evaluated in diabetic encephalopathy. Saffron at 40 and 80 mg/kg significantly increased body weight and serum TNF- and decreased blood glucose levels, glycosylated serum proteins, and serum advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) levels. Furthermore, significant increase in HDL and decrease ( < 0.05) in cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL were observed after 28 days of treatment. At the end of experiments, the hippocampus tissue was used for determination of glutathione content (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities. Furthermore, saffron significantly increased GSH, SOD, and CAT but remarkably decreased cognitive deficit, serum TNF-, and induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity in hippocampus tissue. Our findings indicated that saffron extract may reduce hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia risk and also reduce the oxidative stress in diabetic encephalopathy rats. This study suggested that saffron extract might be a promising candidate for the improvement of chemically induced diabetes and its complications.

Introduction Diabetes mellitus is a serious metabolic disorder which is a major source of ill health all over the world and its incidence is expected to increase by 5.4% in 2025 [1]. It has been shown that patients with diabetes mellitus have increased oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defense systems, which appear to contribute to the initiation and progression of diabetes-associated complications [2]. Diabetic encephalopathy has been recognized as a severe diabetic complication, with adverse functional and cognitive effects. There is a growing body of evidence to support the assertion that the deficits are associated with the damage to the hippocampal neurons [3]. The increased mortality and morbility of encephalopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes is closely associated with hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension [4]. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), generated by nonenzymatic glycation and oxidation of protein and reducing sugars, are known to initiate and aggravate the pathological damage in diabetic encephalopathy [5]. The accumulation of AGEs can damage brain by eliciting oxidative stress which have been implicated in the damage of the structure and function of the brain's neurons and hippocampus [6]. Therefore, interfering with hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, oxidative stress, and the AGEs signaling pathway might have the potential to attenuate hyperglycemia-induced brain damage. Ethnobotanical field studies revealed that a number of plant remedies were used to alleviate the symptoms of diabetes. Saffron obtained from the pistils of Crocus sativus L. flowers and represents the red dry stigmas of the flower. Saffron is used in the traditional medicine for the treatment of numerous diseases including depression, inflammation, cognitive disorders, seizures, and cancer [7, 8]. Further, saffron by its compounds crocin, crocetin, and safranal has high antioxidant activities [9, 10]. The accumulating evidence in vitro and in vivo showed that saffron extract has a beneficial neuroprotective activity on brain ischemia in the rats. Saffron can attenuate the neurotoxicity for the brain's neurons in cerebral infarct and neurodeficit in rat [11]. Diabetes-linked alterations in antioxidant defense system enzymes, such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, have been demonstrated [2]. The negative impact of diabetes on the retinal, renal, nervous, and cardiovascular systems is well recognized, yet little is known about its effect on the brain. On the other hand, whether saffron extract has hypoglycemic, hyperlipidemia, and antioxidant activities that can prevent the pathological damage of diabetes in STZ-induced diabetic rats is unknown. Thus, the present study was designed to evaluate the effect of saffron extract on a model of diabetes mellitus and its effects on serum lipid profiles, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a marker for inflammation, and oxidative stress parameters in this process and the other aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the cognitive function and hypoglycemic and antioxidant activities of saffron extract on diabetic encephalopathy in STZ-induced rats.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Reagents All purified enzymes, coenzymes, substrates, standards, buffers, kits, and the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical (St. Louis, USA).2.2. Preparation of Aqueous Extract of Saffron The saffron used in this study was collected from a private garden and identified by botanists in the herbarium of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (specimen number 293-0303-1). The part of C. sativus that is being used as additive and also as herbal medicine is the stigma. The pistils of saffron flowers were air-dried in the shade before extraction. The stigmas were being powdered for 10 min with the use of mortar and pistil. After grinding, aqueous extract was prepared with 15 g of its ground stigma and 400 mL of distilled water in a Soxhlet extractor for 18 hours. The prepared extract was concentrated to 100 mL with a rotatory evaporator in low pressure, then the extract was dried at 35°C–40°C, and the yield of extraction was 25 mg of freeze-dried powder per 100 mg dry stigma and the extraction was repeated five times. Finally, the extract was filtered through a 0.2 mm filter to be sterilized. The resultant solution was stored at 4°C to 8°C. To prepare the solutions for injection, after weighing, powder was dissolved in distilled water and immediately administered to the animals. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of saffron extract using UV detector with wavelength of 308 nm showed the presence of safranal with concentration of 0.514% and also HPLC analysis of saffron extract using UV detector with wavelength of 443 and 250 nm showed the presence of all crocins and picrocrocin with concentration of 95.83% and 3.02%, respectively.2.3. Study Design 50 male Wistar albino rats weighing 180–220 g were randomly allotted to five experimental groups (n = 10 per group) as follows. The animals were kept in their own cages in a controlled environment, with constant room temperature (21 ± 2°C) under a normal 12 h light/dark cycle. Standard food and water were given ad libitum. Rats in Group A were fed with standard feed and received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 0.9% saline for blank control (C). The animals were housed according to regulations for the Welfare of Experimented Animals. The study was conducted in Mashhad Medical University Experimental Animal Research Laboratory. Protocols were approved by the Ethical Committee (The Ethical Research Committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences). On the first day of the study, the diabetic groups were given streptozocin in a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at a dose of 60 mg/kg for induction of diabetes. Blood was extracted from the tail vein for glucose analysis 72 hours after streptozocin injection. Rats with blood glucose levels greater than 250 mg/dL were considered as diabetic and used for the study. Three days after the induction of diabetes, STZ-treated rats were divided into four groups of ten animals. Group B was left without treatment and served as the untreated diabetic group (D). Groups C, D, and E were treated with saffron extract (i.p. injection) at a daily dose of 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg, respectively. These injections were continued to the end of the study (4 weeks). The daily dosages of saffron extract were used in this experiment and were estimated from the published literature [12]. Groups included low-saffron group (L-saf), moderate-saffron group (M-saf), and high-saffron group (H-saf). Blood glucose level and body weights were recorded at weekly intervals. At the end of the 4-week period, animals were killed by pentobarbital overdose (150 mg/kg, i.p.), and blood was subsequently collected from the retroorbital sinus. Blood and sera were separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min and stored at −80°C until determination within 12 h for glucose and lipid profile. After the rats were sacrificed, brains were removed carefully and then the hippocampi were immediately dissected on a cold plate, weighed, and homogenized with ice cold saline. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Finally, the supernatant was taken for use.2.4. Morris Water Maze Test Animals were tested in the Morris water maze test [13]. The apparatus consisted of a circular water tank. A platform invisible to the rats was set inside the tank and filled with water maintained at approximately 28 ± 2°C. The tank was located in a large room where there were several brightly colored cues external to the maze; these were visible from the pool and could be used by the rats for spatial orientation. The position of the cues remained unchanged throughout the study. The water maze task was carried out for 5 consecutive days. The rats received four consecutive daily training trials in the following 5 days, with each trial having a ceiling time of 90 s and a trial interval of approximately 30 s. For each trail, each rat was put into the water at one of four starting positions, the sequence of which being selected randomly. During test trials, rats were placed into the tank at the same starting point, with their heads facing the wall. The rat had to swim until it climbed onto the platform submerged underneath the water. After climbing onto the platform, the animal remained there for 20 s before the commencement of the next trial. The escape platform was kept in the same position relative to the distal cues. If the rat failed to reach the escape platform within the maximally allowed time of 90 s, it was gently placed on the platform and allowed to remain there for the same amount of time. The time to reach the platform (latency in seconds) was measured.2.5. Measurement of Blood Glucose Glucose concentrations were measured with the Ames One Touch glucometer (One-Touch Basic; Lifescan, Johnson and Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) in rat tail vein blood. Blood glucose was estimated using the diagnostic kits (Pars Azmoon kit, IRI) on an automatic analyzer (Abbott, model Alcyon 300, USA).2.6. Estimation of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-α) Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was estimated using rat TNF-α kit (R&D Systems). It is a solid phase sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a microtitre plate reader at 450 nm. Concentrations of TNF-α were calculated from plotted standard curve. TNF-α levels were expressed as mean ± SEM.2.7. Measurement of Serum Lipid Profile The concentrations of total lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in serum were estimated by using diagnostic kits (Pars Azmoon kit, IRI) on an automatic analyzer (Abbott, model Alcyon 300, USA).2.8. Measurement for Glycosylated Serum Proteins in Serum Serum concentrations of glycosylated serum proteins (GSP) were detected using a commercial kit. In brief, an aliquot of serum (100 μL) was mixed with 2 mL of nitroblue tetrazolium maintained at 37°C for 15 min. At the end of the reaction, a stabilizer was added to the mixture. Finally, the absorbance of the mixture was read at 530 nm with a spectrophotometer.2.9. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for AGEs in Serum Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to quantity AGEs concentration in serum according to the reported method [14]. Briefly, 96-well plate was incubated with diluted serum sample (1 : 5) and standard AGE-bovine serum albumin (40, 80, 160, 320, and 480 ng/L) for 30 min at 37°C. An aliquot of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used for the blank control and then the wells were washed with a wash buffer for five times. Horseradish peroxidase- (HRP-) labeled AGEs antibody (50 μL) was added to maintain for another 30 min at 37°C. After being washed five more times, the plate was incubated with 100 μL of chromogenic agent tetramethyl benzidine with a dark environment for 30 min at 37°C. The blue reaction was changed to yellow by an addition of 50 μL acidic stopping solution. Finally, the absorbance of the samples was measured with a spectrophotometer at 450 nm.2.10. Preparation of Test Samples of Hippocampus The hippocampus tissue of rats was taken quickly after being sacrificed and was excised quickly under sterile conditions. The tissue was cut into pieces and then added with cold saline containing 1% Triton X-100 to prepare the homogenate of hippocampus tissue. The samples were then collected and centrifuged at 14,000 g at 4°C. The supernatant fraction was used for estimation of the glutathione (GSH) content, SOD, CAT activities, and induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity assays within 6 h. Whole homogenates were used for measurement of lipid peroxidation.2.11. Assay of GSH Content in Hippocampus Tissue The GSH content in hippocampus homogenate was determined as described previously [15] and expressed as μmol/L.2.12. Assay of SOD The activity of SOD was determined by the method of S. Marklund and G. Marklund (1974), using inhibition of pyrogallol autooxidation at Ph 8.0 [16]. The specific activity of SOD is expressed as units per mg protein.2.13. Catalase Activity Assay Catalase activity was assayed by H2O2 consumption, following Aebi's (1984) [17]. Briefly, The decomposition of H2O2 can be followed directly by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm. The difference in absorbance per unit time is a measure of CAT activity. Previously, hippocampus homogenate aliquots were centrifuged at 1000 g and 4°C for 10 min. The adequate amount of supernatants (60 μL equivalent to 1.5 mg tissue wet weight) was added to a reaction mixture that contained 0.002% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m phosphate buffer, pH = 7.0, and 15 mm H2O2 in 1 mL final volume. Activity was calculated with the initial 30 s decomposition rate and the results are expressed in mmol/mg protein.2.14. Assay for iNOS Activity in Hippocampus Tissue The pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy is associated with oxidative stress in the body; therefore, the activity iNOS in the serum was measured. The activity of iNOS in the serum was measured by an iNOS activity assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) using a fluorescence microplate reader with excitation/emission wavelength of 495/515 nm.2.15. Analysis of Body Weight during Treatment Period Body weight was recorded at weekly intervals in all the experimental groups.2.16. Statistical Analysis Data from the three groups were expressed as means ± standard deviation. The statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance using GraphPad Prism 5.0 statistical software. Differences between treatment groups were analyzed by Tukey's test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.3. Results3.1. Saffron Extract Significantly Increased Body Weight in STZ-Induced Diabetic Rats As shown in Table 1, during the experimental period (4 weeks), STZ induced diabetic rats had significantly lower body weights (183 ± 11 g) compared with the blank control (301 ± 18 g). However, the treatment with 20 mg/kg saffron extract prevented STZ-decreased body weight in diabetic rats (194 ± 15 g). Interestingly, the treatment with M-saf (40 mg/kg) and H-saf (80 mg/kg) also significantly increased body weight in diabetic rats (231 ± 12 g and 239 ± 14 g, resp.). Furthermore, saffron extract increased the body weight in a dose-dependent manner (Table 1). The results indicate that saffron could improve the body weight in diabetic rats.3.2. Saffron Extract Significantly Decreased Blood Glucose Levels The diabetic rats exhibited significant (P < 0.001) hyperglycemia compared with the control rats (Figure 1). After 4 weeks the saffron extract dose dependently decreased blood glucose levels in the diabetic rats compared with the untreated diabetic rats (Figure 1). Saffron extract (20 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased glucose in STZ diabetic rats only at the 4th week of the study (P < 0.05), while at 40 mg/kg/day saffron reduced significantly blood glucose significantly at the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th week from induction of diabetes compared with untreated diabetic rats (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001, resp.). At the highest dose of saffron extract (80 mg/kg/day), serum blood glucose was significantly reduced beginning from the first week of the treatment (P < 0.05) (Figure 1).3.3. Effect of Saffron Extract on Diabetes-Induced Cognitive Deficit The cognitive function was assessed in the Morris water maze test. The mean escape latency for the trained rats decreased from 55 to 11 s over the course of the 20 learning trials. The mean escape latency did not differ between any of the groups on the first and second days of testing in Morris water maze but from the third day onwards there was significant difference in transfer latency between diabetic (60 ± 6.1) and control (28 ± 4.3) animals. Treatment of saffron significantly decreased mean transfer latency in diabetic animals (Figure 2). Diabetic animals showed a lower ability to find the platform and learn its location in the 5th day of training. This poorer performance was prevented by the treatment with saffron and decreased latency to find the platform from the 3rd day of training (P < 0.05).3.4. Effect of Saffron on Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-α) Serum TNF-α level was markedly (P < 0.001) increased (571.91 ± 51.28 pg/mL) in diabetic rats as compared to control (83.5 ± 14.7 pg/mL). Interestingly, the serum TNF-α level decreased significantly (P < 0.05) to 340.4 ± 27.9 and 265.8 ± 21.4 pg/mL after the administration of 40 and 80 mg/kg saffron extract, respectively (M & H-saf versus untreated diabetic group) (Figure 3).3.5. Saffron Extract Significantly Ameliorate Serum Lipid Profile Levels STZ-injected rats showed significant increases in the serum levels of total lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL but significantly decreased serum HDL level compared to the control group (Figure 2). Saffron extract dose dependently reduced the serum levels of total lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL but, however, increased serum HDL level during the experimental period. At the highest saffron extract dose (80 mg/kg/day) there was no significant difference in total lipid, cholesterol, LDL, and HDL levels between the STZ-treated rats and the control rats (Figure 4).3.6. Effects of Saffron Extract on GSP As shown in Figure 3, there was a significant increase in GSP level between the untreated diabetic group (3.10 ± 0.35 mmol/L) and control (1.93 ± 0.21 mmol/L) (P < 0.05). The 20, 40, and 80 mg/mL doses of saffron extract decreased GSP levels up to 6.45% (2.90 ± 0.21 mmol/L), 19.35% (2.50 ± 0.34 mmol/L), and 32.25% (2.10 ± 0.39 mmol/L), respectively (Figure 5); however, only at the highest dose (80 mg/mL) the treatment significantly decreased GSP levels compared with untreated diabetic group (P < 0.05).3.7. Saffron Extract Significantly Decreased Serum AGEs The accumulation of AGEs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy [18]. In this study, the AGEs level in serum in the untreated diabetic group (1401.7 ± 168.5 ng/L) was elevated significantly as compared with the control (385.3 ± 63.3 ng/L). As shown in Figure 6, L-saf, M-saf, and H-sae significantly inhibited AGE formation up to 14.00%, 29.47%, and 39.30% at doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg, respectively. The AGEs level in serum in the H-saf group was decreased significantly as compared with the untreated diabetic group (P < 0.05; Figure 6). The findings demonstrate that saffron extract is able to inhibit AGE formation in vivo.3.8. GSH Content in Hippocampus Tissue Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the development and progression of diabetic encephalopathy. GSH, a small molecule peptide consisting of three amino acids, has been regarded as an important factor in the antioxidant and scavenging of free radicals in vivo. After being induced by 60 mg/kg STZ, the hippocampal GSH content was lower compared with control (41.73 ±4.12 μmol/L versus 68.17 ± 5.21 μmol/L). More importantly, the GSH content in the hippocampus increased significantly to 60.31 ± 5.22 μmol/L after the administration of 80 mg/kg saffron extract (H-saf versus untreated diabetic group) (Figure 7(a)). Our data support the premise that saffron extract has antioxidant activity on the attenuation of memory deficits in diabetic encephalopathy rats.3.9. SOD Content in Hippocampus Tissue Changes in the activities of SOD in hippocampus of control, untreated diabetic, and saffron extract-treated rats are summarized in Figure 7(b). There was a decrease in SOD in the STZ-diabetic group compared with respective control group (P < 0.01). Saffron extract (40 and 80 mg/kg/day) treated diabetic rats significantly increased the SOD content in hippocampus tissue compared with the untreated diabetic rats (P < 0.05). In addition, there was not a significant difference between diabetic rats treated with high saffron concentration (80 mg/kg/day) and the control group (Figure 7(b)).3.10. CAT Content in Hippocampus Tissue There was a decrease in CAT level in the untreated diabetic group compared with respective control group (P < 0.05), but CAT activity showed a nonsignificant increase in the rats receiving low concentration of saffron compared with the untreated diabetic group. Supplementation with the moderate and high concentration of saffron for a month (40 and 80 mg/kg/day) significantly increased CAT activities in the hippocampus of diabetic rats versus the untreated diabetic group (P < 0.05). In addition, there was not a significant difference between diabetic rats treated with the moderate and high saffron concentrations (40 and 80 mg/kg/day) and the control group (Figure 7(c)). Therefore, treatment with diabetic rats with saffron extract restored the antioxidant enzyme activity nearly to that of control rats.3.11. iNOS Enzyme Activity in Hippocampus Tissue The NOS isoforms play an important role in hippocampus dependent forms of learning in rats [19]. As shown in Figure 8, STZ markedly enhanced the iNOS level in hippocampus of diabetic rats as compared with the control (2.53 ± 0.28 U/mg protein for untreated diabetes group and 0.92 ± 0.12 U/mg protein for control). Interestingly, the STZ-increased iNOS level in the hippocampus was decreased significantly by the treatment with saffron extract of 40 and 80 mg/kg (1.83 ± 0.10 U/mg protein and 1.76 ± 0.17 U/mg protein, resp.). The results show that hippocampal iNOS levels of diabetic rats were correlated negatively with performance (Figure 8). These results suggest that the effect of saffron extract on the STZ-enhanced hippocampal iNOS levels might contribute to the amelioration of memory deficits in diabetic rats.4. Discussion There is clinical evidence that suggests that patients with diabetes have impaired cognitive functions but evidence from experimental studies is not clear. The potential mechanisms for this include direct effects of hypo- or hyperglycaemia and hypo- or hyperinsulinemia and also indirect effects via cerebrovascular alterations [20, 21]. This study analyzed the role of saffron on the biochemical and behavioral function of diabetic rats. The results of the present study indicate that intraperitoneal injection of saffron significantly ameliorated the adverse metabolic effects in rats treated with STZ. Experimental diabetes models can be induced by chemicals that selectively destroy the insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas [22]. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes produced marked impairment in cognitive function which was coupled with marked increase in oxidative stress in the brain. Chronic treatment with saffron significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits. It has been shown that saffron can prevent the impairment of learning and memory to the hippocampus induced by chronic stress and also saffron and its active component (crocin) have the enhancing effects on memory and, therefore, demonstrate its implication in the mechanisms underlying recognition and spatial memory [23]. The direct glucose toxicity in the neurons is especially due to increased intracellular glucose oxidation [24], which leads to an increase in reactive species production [25]. Oxidative stress seems to play a central role in brain damage [26]. Recently, it has been reported that oxidative damage to rat synapses contributes to cognitive deficit [27]. Our results revealed that during experimental period, blood glucose level in untreated diabetic rats was significantly higher compared to the normal control rats. High blood glucose level causes deterioration of pancreatic β cells due to oxidative stress. The results showed that STZ induced diabetic rats had significantly higher serum levels of total lipids, TC, triglycerides, LDL as compared to the normal control group. Increased plasma lipid profile levels in diabetes may be related to the changes in lipid metabolism and structure. Recently, our research also demonstrated that plasma cholesterol and triglycerides levels were increased significantly in diabetic rats induced by STZ [22]. Previous study demonstrated that in diabetic rats the utilization of impaired carbohydrate leads to accelerate lipolysis, resulting in hyperlipidaemia and increased lipid peroxidation which is associated with hyperlipidaemia [28]. In the present study, diabetes caused significant increase in the level of blood glucose along with reduction in body weight. Saffron injection after STZ treatment resulted in lower serum glucose levels and improved lipid profile as well as body weight as compared with rats treated with STZ alone. Lozano et al. reported that saffron extract has various compounds like Krustyn, crocins including the crocin and tricrocin, pykrvkrvsyn, and safranal [29]. These active constituent have antioxidants properties which may be very important in mitigating impaired insulin secretion and action in insulin resistance and prevent diabetes complications [30]. The hypoglycemic effect of saffron extract seems to be exerted by mechanisms such as insulin resistance reducing [31], stimulating of glucose uptake by peripheral tissues [32], and inhibition of intestinal glucose absorption [33]. Regarding the hypolipidemic effects of saffron, Sheng et al., [34] indicated that crocin has lipid lowering properties and selectively inhibits the activity of pancreatic lipase as a competitive inhibitor. Moreover, He et al. [35] found that crocin has a potent hypotriglyceridemic and hypocholesterolemic activity in atherosclerotic quails, so that saffron is beneficial for curing of cardiovascular disorders [36]. The central nervous system (CNS) is sensitive to oxidative stress. Most of the reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) dependent central nervous disorders have been observed to be actually triggered by the presence of free radicals. Free radical generation during brief periods of cerebral ischaemia has been suggested to induce delayed neuronal death [37]. Antioxidant therapy has proved to be remarkably beneficial to combat ROS-induced injury in the CNS [38]. A number of investigations have been performed to indicate that brain loss is a consequence of both type I and type II diabetes [7, 39]. However, the exact mechanism(s) as to how diabetic conditions could affect brain activity remains to be fully characterized. Hyperglycemia increases the generation of free radicals by glucose autooxidation and the increment of free radicals may lead to brain cell damage. Therefore, diabetes-induced oxidative damage is responsible for the changes occurring in the activities of membrane-bound enzymes of significance leading to impaired neuronal activity. Besides the enhanced level of ROS, nitric oxide levels are also increased, and Mastrocola et al. [40] reported that the expression of mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase appears to be significantly increased in the brain mitochondria of diabetic rats with consequent nitric oxide hyperproduction: in those conditions, nitric oxide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase activity but might also act on other mitochondrial components, inhibiting other respiratory chain complexes by nitrosylation or oxidizing protein thiols [40, 41]. Beside its effects on the respiratory chain, nitric oxide may also contribute to cell damage in diabetes, modulating glucose entry into the cells. Indeed, nitric oxide has been shown to upregulate glucose transporters in neurons [42]. This activity has been regarded as protective in conditions (such as cerebral ischemia) in which the glucose supply to the brain is reduced [43]. Our results showed an increase in nitrite levels in hippocampus of diabetic rats and chronic treatment with saffron significantly decreased hippocampal nitrite levels because of its potential to inhibit expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase [44] and nitric oxide scavenging effects [45]. Increasing evidence indicates that factors such as oxidative and nitrosative stress, glutathione depletion, and impaired protein metabolism can interact in a vicious cycle which is central to pathogenesis of dementia. Our previous studies showed that diabetes induces oxidative stress [22]. In the present study, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities were markedly reduced in the hippocampus of diabetic rats. Treatment with saffron returned the levels of reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase towards their control values. These protective effects of saffron against oxidative stress are in agreement with our previously published report [46]. Yoshino et al. [47] reported crocetin- (saffron's component) induced inhibition of cellular reactive oxygen species generation. In the present study saffron significantly ameliorated the cognitive impairment in diabetic rats. Thus, saffron may be preventing oxidative stress in hippocampal neurons and consequently may be improving synaptic plasticity. A transitory brain glutathione deficit results in selectively damaged in spatial memory [48]. Diabetes is chronic metabolic disorder conncted with reduction in glutathione levels which finally terminates to memory deficits in diabetic animals. Since, saffron could prevent intracellular reduced glutathione depletion may due to its antioxidant properties (our unpublished data), therefore, reversal of diabetic cognitive dysfunction could be observed. In the present study, significant decline in GSH level and antioxidant enzymes activity including SOD and CAT in the hippocampal tissue of rats reflects oxidative stress of hippocampus in experimental diabetes. These results are in line with the findings reported by Feillet-Coudray et al. [49], who observed that STZ-induced diabetes in rat accompanied with an increase in the susceptibility to lipid peroxidation. The data of our study also revealed that daily treatment of saffron extract markedly improves antioxidant status of the hippocampus tissue of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes as GSH level and antioxidant enzymes activities comprising SOD and CAT significantly increased. GSH (an important part of the nonenzymatic antioxidant system) is a major nonprotein thiol in living organisms, which plays a central role in coordinating the body's antioxidant defense processes. Perturbation of GSH status of a biological system can lead to serious consequences. Reduction in GSH stores of the hippocampus tissue of diabetic rats suggest that oxidative stress due to free-radical damage is one of the possible mechanisms in the pathophysiology of diabetic encephalopathy. The current investigation showed that the administration of the saffron extract caused the increased GSH levels. This indicates that in the presence of saffron extract there is an improvement in the oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress in the hippocampus tissue of streptozotocin diabetic rats was similarly reported. This was said to be a contributory factor in the development of the complications of diabetes. SOD, CAT, and GSH constitute a mutually supportive team of defense against ROS. SOD is a metalloprotein and is the first enzyme involved in the antioxidant defense by lowering the steady-state level of O2−. In hyperglycaemia, glucose undergoes autooxidation and produces superoxide, and it produces free radicals that in turn lead to lipid peroxidation in lipoproteins. CAT is localized in the peroxisomes or the microperoxisomes, which catalyses the decomposition of H2O2 to water and oxygen and thus protects the cell from oxidative damage produced by H2O2. In our study, decline in the activities of these enzymes in the hippocampus tissue of streptozotocin-induced animals and attainment of near normalcy in saffron extract treated rats indicate that oxidative stress elicited in the hippocampus of diabetic rats had been nullified due to the effect of the extract. Thus, considering the pathophysiology of diabetes and the results presented in the present work, it is sensible to suggest that saffron ameliorates oxidative stress parameters in the hippocampus. In fact, ROS causes damage in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [50]. In addition, Bhattacharya et al. [51] reported decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, enhanced cytochrome c release, reciprocal regulation of the Bcl-2 family, and increases of caspases 3 and 9 in alloxan-induced diabetes. The authors also showed that treatment with D-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone, a derivative of D-glucaric acid which has antioxidant properties, counteracted these changes. The accumulation of GSP levels (GSP) and AGEs, derived from the nonenzymatic glycation of reducing sugars and proteins, contributes to the development of diabetic encephalopathy [52]. The daily intake of 40 and 80 mg/kg saffron significantly increased body weight and decreased blood glucose, GSP levels, and serum AGEs levels in STZ-induced diabetic encephalopathy rats. The findings indicate that saffron has a beneficial effect on diabetic encephalopathy. AGEs are the final products of nonenzymatic glycation and oxidation of proteins and lipids, which have been found to deposit in human tissues with aging and brains of diabetic patients [53]. AGEs are believed to play a crucial role in the development and the progression of diabetic encephalopathy by the damaging the structure and functional properties of the hippocampus and cerebral cortical neurons via binding to cell surface receptors for AGEs (RAGE) [15]. The receptor for AGEs (RAGE) is a multiligand receptor protein thought to play an important role in neuronal damage [54]. The interaction between AGEs and RAGE activates a variety of signaling pathways that lead to the pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy, such as neurodegeneration [55]. Our study also provided further confirmation that the accumulation of AGEs activated RAGE in the hippocampus neurons. However, saffron extract treatment ameliorated the elevated AGEs associated with diabetic encephalopathy. These results suggest that the decreased hyperglycemia with saffron administration might contribute to the amelioration of hyperglycemia-induced encephalopathy damage. Proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α) are known to be increased in several neuropathological states that are associated with learning and memory. In addition to oxidative and nitrosative stress, hyperglycemia is also associated with enhanced inflammatory response [56, 57]. Under chronic hyperglycemia, endogenous TNF-α production is in increased microvascular and neural tissues, which may cause accelerated microvascular permeability, hypercoagulability, and nerve damage, thus initiating and promoting the development of characteristic lesions of diabetic microangiopathy, polyneuropathy, and encephalopathy [58, 59]. It has been recently reported that uncontrolled diabetes significantly enhanced TNF-α level [60]. A significant inhibition of TNF-α levels by saffron observed in our study is indicative of the fact that saffron contributes to beneficial effects seen in diabetic encephalopathy. With respect to inflammation, saffron reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. In our knowledge for the first time, we showed the effects of the animal model of diabetes induced by STZ on oxidative stress parameters in the hippocampus of rats and also indicated for the first time that the treatment with saffron ameliorated them. The present study showed pharmacologic effect of saffron (C. sativus Linn.) extract in hippocampus complications of diabetes. Thus, saffron treatment ameliorated blood glucose, cognitive deficit, lipid profile, reduced oxidative stress, nitric oxide, and TNF-α in the diabetic rats. Moreover, the findings of the study also suggested that the principle mechanisms involved in the antidiabetic and neuroprotective effect of saffron are its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential. Although, its low side-effect profile and long history of safe use, many questions related to antihyperglycemic and antioxidant effect of C. sativus extract remain unanswered. Much more work is clearly needed before phytotherapy for diabetic encephalopathy can be advanced to clinic. Therefore, it seems that saffron extract has positive effects on the prevention of early hippocampal injury in diabetes mellitus due to oxidative stress and can be recommended in diabetic humans as herbal drug after randomized clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae, (formerly Pseudomonas avenae) is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped causal bacterial agent, which infects many economically important crops, including rice, maize, millet, oats, sugarcane, and foxtail (Song et al., 2004). In rice, it causes bacterial brown stripe (BBS) disease, which is a devastating rice disease in some areas in Asia, Africa, North America, and Europe (Xie et al., 1998, 2011). Although this worldwide rice disease has caused significant yield and quality losses, currently little is known about this bacterial pathogen, especially at the molecular and cellular levels. Recently, the draft genome sequence of A. avenae subsp. avenae RS-1 has been released (Xie et al., 2011). This opens a new avenue to study this pathogen that will ultimately lead to better control of this disease. Comparative genomic analysis with closely related species has revealed several novel horizontally transferred gene clusters in this pathogen (Xie et al., 2011). Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a progress in which an organism incorporates genetic material from other organisms without vertical inheritance. This progress has been considered as a major driving force in bacterial evolution (Ochman et al., 2000). HGT can transfer not only one gene to the recipient that enhances the niche adaption, but even an entire gene cluster that may dramatically alter the metabolic repertoire of the host, even creating functional novelties, including stress response (Slade and Radman, 2011). Bacterial cells are always exposed to various adverse conditions and surroundings, which compel them to adapt to conditions far from optimum. For example, oxidative stress occurs when reactive oxygen species are naturally generated in aerobically growing cells where incomplete reduction of molecular oxygen happens during their normal metabolism. These toxic compounds induce oxidative stress to the cell, damaging nucleic acids, and proteins (Imlay, 2013). The reactive oxygen species include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide radical (O2⋅), and hydroxyl radical (HO⋅). Reactive oxygen species can also occur from a variety of environmental sources, such as redox-cycling agents and ionizing radiation (Sies, 1997). Paraquat, one kind of redox-cycling agents, can generate endogenous superoxide stress and react with respiratory chain components in bacterial cells (Tu et al., 2012). In most cases, survival in this unstable environment requires a wide range of adaptive, effective feedbacks mediated or triggered by regulatory proteins (Ramos et al., 2005). The TetR protein family is a common class of transcriptional regulator found in a diversity of bacteria. It has been reported that this protein family can take function in various physiological processes, such as biosynthesis of antibiotics and expression of enzymes implicated in catabolic pathways, and multidrug resistance (MDR; August et al., 1998; van der Geize et al., 2000; Cho et al., 2003; Rand et al., 2006). However, only about 5% among them have been fully characterized (Ramos et al., 2005; Hillerich and Westpheling, 2008), and fewer were reported in phytopathogens (Ramos et al., 2005). Whole genome sequencing of the A. avenae subsp. avenae RS-1 strain has provided a general view of HGT, which may have enhanced its pathogenicity or survival ability. In this study, we found a horizontally transferred gene cluster containing four genes including the tetR gene and paraquat-inducible genes (pqiAA’B). We investigated the role of TetR in regulating expression of this gene cluster and found it negatively regulated its expression. We also found TetR plays a role in cell growth rate, biofilm formation, and oxidative stress survival.MATERIALS AND METHODSBACTERIA STRAINS, PLASMIDS, AND CULTURE CONDITIONS Strains and plasmids used in this study were listed in Table 1. A. avenae subsp. avenae strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or LB with 1.5% (w/v) agar at 30°C. LB agar without sucrose and LB agar containing 10% (w/v) sucrose were used for deletion mutagenesis (Li et al., 2011). The bacterial optical density (OD600) was determined with a spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda35 UV/VIS). When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin (Amp), 100 μg ml-1; chloromycetin (Chl), 3.4 μg ml-1; kanamycin (Km), 50 μg ml-1; and rifampicin (Rif), 100 μg ml-1.Table 1 Strains and plasmids used in this study.Strain or plasmidRelevant characteristicsaSource or referenceStrainsAcidovorax avenae subsp. avenaeRS-1RifR; The pathogen of bacterial brown stripe of rice, isolated from the diseased rice from Zhejiang province in ChinaLab collectionRS-tetRRifR, RS-1 in-frame deletion mutation defective in tetRThis studyRS-tetR-compRifR, AmpR, ChlR; RS-tetR complemented with pRADK-tetRThis studyEscherichia coliDH5αF- Φ80d lacZΔM15Δ(lacZYA-argF) U169 recA1 endA1, hsdR17(rk-, mk+) phoA supE44λ- thi-1 gyrA96 relA1This studyS17-1(λ pir)λ Lysogenic S17-1 derivative producing π protein for replication of plasmids carrying oriR6K; recAprohsdRRP4-2-Tc::Mu-Km::Tn7 λ- pirSimon et al.

Experiments were performed in greenhouse. For inoculating plants, strains were grown in LB broth for 48 h, diluted in ddH2O, and adjusted to OD600 of 0.6 (1 × 108 CFU ml-1; Liu et al., 2012). Leaf-clip inoculation was carried out on 6 weeks-old rice plants. Lesion length was measured at 14 days post-inoculation (Yu et al., 2011).PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS Each gene of interest was compared against sequences in the NCBI nr database using BLASTp (Altschul et al., 1997) followed by extracting the sequence of each specie with highest similarity for further study. We considered two genes as homologs when E-value <10-5 and when the alignment similarity was higher than 40% with more than 80% coverage (Nogueira et al., 2009). ClustalW was used for sequences alignment (Thompson et al., 1994), and the conserved region of each alignment was trimmed with Gblocks (Castresana, 2000) under stringent settings described previously (Ciccarelli et al., 2006). Maximum Likelihood (Fang et al., 1999) phylogenies were evaluated and built by PhyML (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003) using a JTT model and a gamma distribution with eight rate categories. We performed 1,000 bootstraps to gain branch support values.CONSTRUCTION OF tetR-DEFECTIVE DELETION MUTANT AND COMPLEMENTATION To investigate the role of tetR in A. avenae subsp. avenae, an in-frame deletion mutation by double cross-over events of this gene (RS_1091) was constructed as described previously using the suicide vector pKMS1 (Li et al., 2011; Zou et al., 2011) by homologous recombination on the background of wild-type strain RS-1. Briefly, two fragments flanking the start and stop codons of target gene, tetR1 (250 bp) and tetR2 (186 bp), were amplified from the wide-type genomic DNA (gDNA) with primer pairs tetR1-F/tetR1-R and tetR2-F/tetR2-R (Table S1), respectively. The two fragments were digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into the vector pKMS1 at the corresponding sites, resulting in pKMS-tetR. This recombinant plasmid was transferred into Escherichia coli S17-1 λ pir (Simon et al., 1983) and then introduced into A. avenae subsp. avenae by filter mating (Smith and Guild, 1980). The single colonies that emerged on LB plates containing kanamycin and rifampicin at 30°C for 2 days were then transferred to LB broth medium followed by incubating at 30°C and 200 rpm for 16 h. Afterward, the bacterial culture was plated to LB agar containing 10% (w/v) sucrose for the second cross-over through sacB and sucrose-positive selection. After sucrose resistant colonies were patched onto LB and LB plus kanamycin plates, respectively, individual colony that grew normally on LB plates, but did not grow on LB containing kanamycin, was considered potential deletion mutants where double exchange homologous recombination events occurred at the two tetR fragments, resulting in a 267 bp deletion. One of the mutants, named RS-tetR, was subsequently verified by PCR and sequencing before using for further study. In order to complement the RS-tetR strain, the 1062 bp fragment containing full-length of tetR gene and 300 bp of its upstream region was amplified by PCR. The primers were designed based on RS-1 genome and listed in Table S1. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector, verified by sequencing, and then cloned into pRADK (Gao et al., 2005). Complementation vector was introduced into mutant cells by electroporation and complementary strain was selected by resistance to Chl and Amp.GROWTH CURVE AND SURVIVAL ASSAYS In order to monitor the growth rate, the growth curve assays were performed as described by Tu et al. (2012) with minor modification. 1 ml overnight culture, which was grown at 30°C with 200 rpm agitation in LB broth, was added into 99 ml fresh LB broth to OD600 of 0.05. The concentration of commercial 30% H2O2 (10 mol L-1) solution and 100 mmol L-1 paraquat (N,N′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dichloride, C12H14Cl2N2, 257.16 g mol-1) solution (2.57 g solid paraquat diluted with 100 ml ddH2O) were used. The reactive oxygen compound (H2O2 or paraquat) was added at mid-log phase (OD600=0.3) to the indicated final concentrations. After comparing with the untreated bacterial growth curve, the sensitivity and tolerance of cells to the reagents was determined. This experiment was repeated three times independently.PROTEIN PURIFICATION AND LC-MS/MS ANALYSIS Protein extraction was performed as described by Tu et al. (2012) with some modifications. Briefly, 2 ml overnight grown cells were added to 100 ml fresh LB broth to continue growing at 30°C with 200 rpm agitation. Paraquat or H2O2 was added to cells at mid-log phase (OD600=0.3) to the indicated concentration that perturbed the growth without causing cell death according to the survival assay (40/60 mM H2O2 or 0.4/0.8 mM paraquat, RS-1/RS-tetR). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 g, 10 min, 4°C) after exposure to the oxidative compounds for 60 min. Then the cells were treated with lysozyme (1 mg/mL) in the phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), disrupted by ultrasound, and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C in a Sorvall centrifuge to remove cell debris. A second-time centrifugation step (20,000 g, 30 min, 4°C) was required by by Sorvall centrifuge (Sorvall WX100, Thermo Scientific, USA). The protein content was quantified using the enhanced BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, China). Protein extracts were subject to 1D SDS-PAGE gel composed of 5% acrylamide for stacking gel and 10% for running gel (Schägger and Von Jagow, 1987) with a mini-gel apparatus (VE-180 vertical electrophoresis bath, Tanon, China). Subsequently, the separated protein bands in the SDS-PAGE gel were visualized by silver staining. The peptides released from trypsin digestion for LC-MS/MS analyzing were prepared in two biological replicates. LC was performed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-LC system. Firstly, the tryptic peptides were acidified by 2% acetonitrile with 0.025% trifluoroacetic acid before loading onto the Dionex Acclaim PepMap 100, C18 trap column (20 mm × 100 μm, 5 μm, 100 Å) at the flow rate of 10 μl min-1. Then, the Dionex Acclaim PepMap 100, C18 analytical column (150 mm × 75 μm, 3 μm, 100 Å) were applied to divide the enriched tryptic peptides by gradient elution. The Bruker amaZon electron transfer reaction (ETD) ion trap system coupled with nano source expanded the capability to identify the trapped tryptic peptides under 300–1400 m/z and 50–2200 m/z scan range for MS and MS/MS, respectively. The MASCOT LC-MS/MS ion search algorithm (Matrix Sciences) was applied to evaluate the LC/MS spectra and sequence similarity of resulting peptides to A. avenae subsp. avenae RS-1 was compared with Acidovorax species accessible on NCBI. To further identify the proteins, the cross correlation scores (X corr; Lin et al., 2007) of singly-, doubly- and triply-charged peptides were fixed greater than 1.8, 2.5 and 3.5, respectively. Then, a list of peptide sequences with the highest X corr values was identified. The hydrophobic nature of proteins was accessed through evaluating the grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) score of peptides by ProtParam ExPASy. Furthermore, proteins were annotated by RAST automatic pipeline to analyze their function.ENZYME ASSAYS FOR SOD AND CATALASE After protein purification as mentioned above, 1–2.5 μg protein was used to measure superoxide dismutase (SOD) or catalase activities. Precisely, SOD activity was determined with a SOD assay Kit-WST (Beyotime, China). The Catalase Assay Kit (Beyotime, China) was used to detect catalase activity. Briefly, for SOD activity assay, the samples were treated by WST-8 [2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)- 2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt] and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Afterward, the absorption maximum at 450 nm was measured by Thermo Multiskan EX Micro plate Photometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SOD activity was calculated by standard curve according to the instruction of manufacturer in kit. For catalase assay, the samples were treated with 10 μl of 250 mM H2O2 and incubated 5 min at room temperature, and the remaining H2O2 (not decomposed by catalase) was coupled with a substrate to generate N-4-antipyryl-3-chloro-5-sulfonate-p-benzoquinonemonoimine, which has an absorption maximum at 520 nm and was quantified spectrophotometrically. Catalase activity was then calculated by standard curve according to the instruction of manufacturer in kit. These experiments were repeated three times independently.BIOFILM FORMATION ASSAY Biofilm formation assays were performed using the crystal violet (CV) assay method (Peeters et al., 2008). Bacteria were grown overnight with approximately 200 rpm agitation and diluted at 1:50 into fresh LB media. 100 μl of 108 CFU ml-1 mutant or wild-type bacterial suspension was added to one well of 96-well microtitre plate with sterile ddH2O serving as blanks. Cells were allowed to form biofilm at 30°C for 48 h without agitation. After the planktonic organisms were removed and each well in the plate was rinsed and air-dried, 125 μl of 0.1% (w/v) CV solution was used to stain biofilm and 150 μl of 33% acetic acid was added to release the bond CV. The optical density was measured at 590 nm using a Thermo Multiskan EX Micro plate Photometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). This experiment was repeated three times independently with 12 replicates each.RNA EXTRACTION AND REAL-TIME PCR The bacterial culture (OD600=1.0) was utilized for RNA extraction after exposure to the oxidative stressor (40/60 mM H2O2 or 0.4/0.8 mM paraquat, RS-1/RS-tetR) for 10 min. Bacterial total RNA was extracted from RS-1 and RS-tetR strain respectively as described by the manual of RNeasy Protect Bacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and then used for generating first strand complementary DNA (cDNA) as described in the protocol of the Takara PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara). Briefly, 1 ml of bacterial cells were mixed with 2 ml of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent before incubating for 5 min at room temperature. A pellet was obtained after centrifugation and was then treated by TE buffer (10 mM Tris⋅Cl, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme at room temperature for 5 min. After detecting the RNA quantity by agarose gel electrophoresis and the quality by Nanodrop ND1000 spectrophotometer V 3.5.2 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA), 1 μg of the resulting total RNA was used at 42°C for 2 min to eliminate gDNA by gDNA Eraser and buffer before obtaining cDNA. Then the reverse transcription reaction was accomplished by incubating at 37°C for 15 min and then 85°C for 5 s in the presence of random RT primers. An ABI PRISM 7500 Real-Time PCR System and SYBR green fluorescence chemistry (SYBR Green I Master Kit, Roche Diagnostics) were employed to perform quantitative real-time RT-PCR amplification and analysis. Real-time PCR amplification was generated with 30 s of initial denaturation at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95°C, 30 s at 60°C for amplification. The reference genes (16S rRNA of both RS-1 and RS-tetR) were used to normalize the measurements between samples. Data analyses were based on change-in-cycling-threshold method (2-ΔΔCt; Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). RNA extraction was carried out with two replicates per strain and qPCR was performed with three replicates.EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION OF THE tetR PROTEIN The tetR gene was PCR-amplified from A. avenae subsp. avenae RS-1 genome with primers that introduced a BamHI site overlapping the translation initiation codon and a SalI site downstream of the stop codon, respectively (Table S1). A 763 bp tetR-containing DNA fragment was cut with BamHI and SalI and subcloned into the pGEX6P-1 expression vector (Novagen, USA) with the same restriction enzymes, yielding pGEX6P-tetR. Subsequently, pGEX6P-tetR was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and was grown in LB medium containing 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin at 30°C to OD600=0.5. Afterward, the culture was grown for an additional 3 h after isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 g, 4°C for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (70 mM HEPES, 20 mM imidazole, 650 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 8; Balhana et al., 2013). Cells were disrupted on ice by ultrasonic treatment for 20 min with 8 s rest period every 16 s and the supernatant was recovered by removing the cellular debris through centrifugation (12,000 g, 20 min, 4°C). Subsequently, TetR protein with GST-tag was separated and eluted by GST-Tag Bind resin (Sangon Biotech, China) followed by the manufacturer and the purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of the purified protein was determined using the enhanced BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, China).ELECTROPHORETIC MOBILITY SHIFT ASSAYS (EMSA) A 292 bp fragment comprising the intergenic region between tetR and pqiA’ was PCR amplified from A. avenae subsp. avenae RS-1 gDNA and the 3′-end of the fragment was labeled by biotin to be used as probe, according to the procedures of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) Probe Biotin Labeling Kit (Beyotime, China). A 150 bp DNA fragment from the downstream of pqiB gene was worked as non-specific DNA control. Binding reactions were carried out by incubating varying concentrations of protein with 0.05 pmol of labeled probe in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. The EMSA were performed using a Light-Shift chemiluminescence EMSA kit (Beyotime, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions and the membrane was washed and detected following chemiluminescent method using Streptavidin-HRP conjugates and BeyoECL Plus reagents. ECL signals were captured and visualized by exposing the membrane to HyperfilmTM (GE Healthcare).STATISTICAL ANALYSES When needed, the data of quantitative assays were analyzed by SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) using an analysis of variance test and the mean values were compared with the least significant differences test. Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) enrichment analysis was carried out based on the Hypergeometric Test,P=∑i=xn(Mi)⁢(N−Mn−i)(Nn) In which, N means the number of genes in the RS-1 genome, M means the number of genes filling into one COG category in the RS-1 genome, n means the number of differential proteins in tetR mutant LC-MS/MS result and I means the number of genes filling into one COG category in tetR mutant LC-MS/MS result. P < 0.01 was used as the cutoff to define the significance.RESULTSTHE SYNTENY AND ORIGIN OF GENE CLUSTER Horizontal gene transfer is an important mechanism driving the evolution of microbial genomes (Gogarten and Townsend, 2005). By comparing with A. avenae subsp. avenae ATCC 19860 and A. citrulli AAC00-1, two most closely related genomes deposited in public database, we found that the upstream and downstream regions of this cluster were highly conserved (Figure 1), indicating a novel gene cluster in RS-1. This cluster encodes four genes including pqiAA’B and tetR gene. The tetR gene is located upstream from the paraquat-inducible genes (pqiAA’B) in tandem. In the phylogenetic trees generated using the four genes in this cluster, RS-1 always grouped together with different bacterial species, with Pseudomonas as the out-group (Figure S1). These gene trees were highly incongruent with the bacterial species tree. Based on these results, we hypothesize that this gene cluster may be horizontally transferred from a Pseudomonas ancestor.FIGURE 1 Alignment of Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae RS-1, ATCC 19860 and A. citrulli AAC00-1 chromosomes. One cluster was found in RS-1 containing four genes including tetR and pqiAA’B. Sequences from this cluster with upstream and downstream sequences were aligned with A. avenae subsp. avenae ATCC 19860 and A. citrulli AAC00-1. The single-headed arrows represent the position and orientation of the gene in genome. The deleted site of the tetR gene was shown by inverted triangle. In previous reports, TetR family members are particularly abundant in microbes and play important roles in bacterial adaptability or fitness when they are exposed to adverse environmental challenges, such as oxidative stress conditions (Ramos et al., 2005). Thus, in order to understand the role of the TetR protein in RS-1, we decided to investigate its molecular function by deleting tetR gene in RS-1 strain (Figure S2).THE tetR MUTANT SHOWED DECREASED BACTERIAL GROWTH RATE AND INCREASED TOLERANCE TO OXIDATIVE STRESS The growth rate of the tetR mutant strain RS-tetR decreased significantly compared with the wild-type as well as the complemented strain RS-tetR-comp (Figure S3). Wild-type and RS-tetR-comp strains entered the log phase 1 h after the culture started and the OD600 reached up to 2.2 while the RS-tetR strain entered the log phase much later and its OD600 only reached 1.7. In order to investigate the tolerance capability of A. avenae subsp. avenae strains to oxidative stress, we carried out a comparative analysis of the growth kinetics under different concentrations of paraquat or H2O2. Generally, paraquat or H2O2 strongly inhibited the growth of both mutant and wild-type strains. Importantly, the mutant strain showed higher resistance than wild-type strain to these reactive oxygen reagents (H2O2 or paraquat) when added at mid-log phase (OD600=0.3; as the arrow shown in Figure S4). Six different concentrations of paraquat (0.0–1.0 mM) or H2O2 (0–100 mM) were used to test their effects. At 0.4 mM paraquat or 40 mM H2O2, RS-1 and RS-tetR-comp were completely inhibited, showing no further growth (Figures S4A,B,E,F), whereas the RS-tetR was little affected and continued to grow. At 0.8 mM of paraquat or 60 mM of H2O2, growth of RS-tetR strain was inhibited (Figures S4C,D), whereas RS-1 and RS-tetR-comp cells started to die. Moreover, the results from LB plate assay were consistent with those of growth curves. The RS-tetR grew well on LB plates containing 0.8 mM paraquat or 60 mM H2O2, while RS-1 and RS-tetR-comp was inhibited (Figure 2). These data suggest that TetR is involved in negative regulation of cell growth and adaption under oxidative stress.FIGURE 2 Survival assays of RS-1, RS-tetR and RS-tetR-comp, respectively. The mutant strain grew well on the LB plates containing paraquat or H2O2, while the growth of wild-type and complementary cells were inhibited. (A) Growth on LB plate without oxidative reagent; (B,C) Growth on LB plate with 0.8 mM paraquat and 60 mM H2O2, respectively.DIFFERENCE IN BIOFILM FORMATION, BUT NO DIFFERENCE IN BACTERIAL VIRULENCE The morphological appearance and thickness of biofilm showed obvious differences after 48 h of adhesion at 30°C without agitation. Particularly, RS-tetR strain formed a thicker biofilm compared with RS-1 and RS-tetR-comp strains. When quantified, RS-tetR yielded readings twice as high as RS-1 and RS-tetR-comp (Figure 3). The quantitative data confirmed that the mutant strain exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) higher biofilm-forming capability compared to the other two strains. However, the virulence did not show significant difference comparing among wild-type, mutant and complementation strains by observation of symptoms and analysis of lesion lengths 14 days post-inoculation (Figure S5).FIGURE 3 Biofilm quantification and optical density measurements at 590 nm. Bacterial cells were placed in 96-well plate at 30°C without agitation. After 48 h, biofilm was formed and stained by 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet solution before releasing by 33% acetic acid. Means ± SEM are shown; n = 12. Different letters indicated significant differences (P < 0.05) among treatments.INCREASED ACTIVITIES OF SOD AND CATALASE IN tetR MUTANT CELLS WITH OXIDATIVE STRESS Superoxide dismutase and catalase in cytoplasm of bacterial cells play a pivotal role in protection against superoxide and peroxide stress (Henriques et al., 1998; Inaoka et al., 1999). They are highly efficient enzymes and likely to be transiently induced (Hassett and Cohen, 1989). Our results in Figure 4 showed that their enzyme activities were increased in response to oxidative stress compared to the untreated control (Figure 4). More importantly, the RS-tetR mutant strain showed markedly higher levels of catalase and SOD activities compared to wild-type and complemented strains (Figure 4). The quantitative analysis of SOD activity showed that the absence of TetR led to ∼2.3-fold increase in enzyme activity in paraquat treatment and ∼2.2-fold in the H2O2 treatment. The quantitative catalase activity analysis yielded similar results: deletion of tetR resulted in ∼2.7-fold and ∼2.1-fold increase in H2O2-treated and paraquat-treated samples, respectively. These results raised the question as to whether TetR can also influence expression of genes encoding other oxidative stress detoxifying enzymes, such as sodAB, katA, ahpCF and hemAXCDBL (Zuber, 2009). We therefore carried out LC-MS and quantitative PCR analysis to address this issue.FIGURE 4 Total SOD (A) and catalase (B) activities in response to superoxide and peroxide stress. Enzyme activities of different strains were evaluated using cytoplasmic proteins after 60 min induction with oxidative compounds (0.4/0.8 mM paraquat or 40/60 mM H2O2, RS-1 and RS-tetR-comp/RS-tetR). Error bars indicated standard deviations from three independent experiments.IDENTIFICATION OF PROTEINS REGULATED BY tetR In order to investigate how many proteins can be influenced by TetR under oxidative conditions, we employed 1D SDS-PAGE to compare cytoplasmic proteins of RS-1 and RS-tetR, prepared as described in Section “Materials and Methods” (Figure 5). The resultant protein bands were further digested and peptides were then analyzed by LC-MS/MS subsequently.FIGURE 5 1D SDS-PAGE of cytoplasmic proteins obtained from A. avenae subsp. avenae cells. Lane 1–3, wild-type strain RS-1 under no stress conditions, 0.4 mM paraquat and 40 mM H2O2 stress conditions, respectively; Lane 4–6, mutant strain RS-tetR under 0.8 mM paraquat, 60 mM H2O2 stress conditions and no stress conditions, respectively. The protein profiling data of LC-MS/MS from two biological replicates revealed a non-redundant list of proteins, after removing overlapping entries, with high (>98%) confidence. The results clearly suggest differential expression of these newly identified cytoplasmic proteins between wild-type and tetR mutant strains. In total, there are 111 proteins identified (Tables S2 and S3). Specifically, 15 proteins were only identified in RS-1 while 96 proteins were identified only in RS-tetR. These proteins are mainly associated with oxidative stress response, detoxification, and biofilm-formation. COG enrichment suggested that there were more proteins involved in energy production and conversion, cell motility, post-translational modification in the RS-tetR strain, compared to RS-1 (P < 0.01, hypergeometric distribution test); whereas the wild-type strain produced more proteins involved in coenzyme transport and metabolism, amino acid transport and metabolism, and cell division (Figure S6). Overall, these results provide an explanation for the observed physiological changes caused by TetR and support our main hypothesis that this gene cluster plays a key role in bacterial survival under oxidative stress.QUANTITATIVE PCR ANALYSIS OF THE tetR-REGULATED GENES The LC-MS/MS study exhibited a comprehensive profile of proteins whose coding genes are regulated by the TetR regulator under oxidative stress. For further confirmation, we selected 11 genes from the proteomic profile which were involved in oxidative stress response or biofilm-formation, or encoded detoxifying enzymes. We examined their gene expression with quantitative real-time PCR. The results in Figure 6 showed different fold change in gene expression regulated by tetR comparing mutant to wild-type strain. As expected, the expression of pqiA’AB was significantly up-regulated in the RS-tetR strain (6.2-, 6.5-, 7.8-fold, respectively). Similar results were obtained for genes sodA, ahpF and katA, which encode SOD, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, and catalase, respectively (Figure 6). Up-regulated expression in these genes is expected to lead to increase in detoxifying enzyme activities, as shown in SOD and catalase activities assay (Figure 6). Moreover, the increased detoxifying enzyme activity can also contribute to the higher resistance to paraquat and H2O2. Flagella are important for bacterial colonization and biofilm formation (Conrad, 2012; Bogino et al., 2013; Ren et al., 2013). Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the gene expression level of fliL and flaB, two flagella-associated genes, was 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold higher in the absence of TetR. The clpAB gene family plays a role in synthesis of stable and native proteins, which are required for intracellular replication, stress tolerance, and biofilm formation of bacteria, in the presence of ATP (Wawrzynow et al., 2003; Frees et al., 2004). Thereby it was not surprising to see these genes up-regulated in the absence of the tetR regulator.FIGURE 6 Quantitative PCR analysis shown as fold change in gene expression regulated by tetR. The data were quantified by the change-in-cycling-threshold method (2-ΔΔCt) using the 16S rRNA for normalization. Total RNA was extracted from RS-1 and RS-tetR cells exposed to the oxidative compounds for 10 min. Error bars indicated standard deviations from three independent experiments. Different letters indicated significant differences (P < 0.05) among treatments.TetR BINDS TO pqiA’-tetR INTERGENIC REGION To investigate whether the repression of the genes on the gene cluster by TetR occurs via physical interaction between TetR and the promoter of the gene cluster, we performed EMSA using a 292 bp putative promoter fragment of the pqiA’-tetR intergenic region from A. avenae subsp. avenae RS-1 (Figure 7A). We purified the TetR protein with GST tag (about 48 kDa) and confirmed it by SDS-PAGE with silver staining (Figures S7A,B). After mixing the biotin-labeled probe with TetR, a band with substantial mobility shift corresponding to a TetR-DNA complex was detected (Figure 7B, Lane 3–5). When TetR concentration was increased, an increase in the shifted band was observed (Figure 7B, Lane 3–5). This result indicates that the binding of TetR to the DNA fragment is concentration dependent. As a control, we showed that there was no mobility shift of the probe when TetR was not added (Figure 7B, Lane 2). In addition, a strong binding shift appeared when unlabeled non-specific DNA was added (Figure 7B, Lane 1); while when unlabeled cold probe was added, it abolished the binding, demonstrating the binding sensitivity and specificity of TetR for this intergenic region (Figure 7B, Lane 6–7).FIGURE 7 Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of TetR binding to the pqiA’-tetR intergenic region. (A) The 292 bp DNA fragment comprising the intergenic region between the tetR and pqiA’ genes was amplified by PCR and used as probe in EMSAs. (B) Detection of protein–DNA complexes by EMSA using 0.05 pmol labeled probe incubated with increasing amount of GST-TetR protein (0 mg, Lane 2; 0.20 mg, Lane 3; 0.40 mg Lane 4; 0.60 mg, Lane 5). The 5 pmol unlabelled non-specific DNA, 0.05 and 5 pmol unlabeled specific DNA (cold competitor probe) was mixed and incubated with 0.40 mg purified GST-TetR protein before adding labeled specific probe in Lane 1, Lane 6 and Lane 7, respectively.DISCUSSION It is believed that pathogenic bacteria can acquire and integrate foreign DNA into its chromosome. This process has been hypothesized to give advantages to the pathogenic bacteria (Dobrindt et al., 2004). A. avenae subsp. avenae, the phytopathogen causing BBS disease, has developed several mechanisms to defend itself against oxidative stress, including induction of protective enzymes against peroxide/superoxide and adjustment of eﬄux pumps. HGT is an efficient means to acquire foreign DNA, which helps to adjust cellular responses to successfully survive environmental challenges, such as oxidative stress. Many methods have been developed to detect HGT including GC content, codon usage and phylogenetic tree analyses (Eisen, 2000). In these, phylogenetic tree has proven to be the “golden standard” for HGT detection (Bansal et al., 2012). Our phylogenetic tree analysis suggested that this gene cluster might be acquired from a Pseudomonas ancestor as many Pseudomonas species clustered with RS-1 (Figure S1). Consistent with this evidence, A. avenae RS-1 and most Pseudomonas strains are both soil dwellers; many Pseudomonas strains are plant pathogenic bacteria (Sarkar and Guttman, 2004). Thus, RS-1 may have gained these genes from a Pseudomonas donor. In most cases, TetR-like transcriptional factors are believed to have two domains responsible for signal perception and DNA-binding, respectively (Hillerich and Westpheling, 2008). Besides, it was reported that the TetR protein regulates many genes and pathways in bacteria that are involved in secondary metabolism, MDR, and so on (Ramos et al., 2005; Hillerich and Westpheling, 2008). The deletion of the tetR gene in RS-1 rendered the bacterium more resistant to oxidative conditions, suggesting that it normally functions to regulate the onset of anti-oxidative stress response. Moreover, the LC-MS/MS results revealed that the TetR can regulate expression of multi-proteins in RS-1. Biofilm-forming capacity of bacteria is important for their survival and infection on host cells. Therefore, studies on the regulatory mechanisms governing biofilm formation are important and could eventually lead to prevention of or therapy for pathogen infections. Nevertheless, the regulation of biofilm formation is too complex and multifactorial because of the varying environmental factors, including osmolarity, temperature, anaerobiosis, and levels of iron, ethanol, glucose, nitrites, and citrate (Prigent-Combaret et al., 1999; Schlag et al., 2007). In addition, there are a number of endogenous proteins, for instance CsrA, Crc, BfdR, and LuxR, which regulate biofilm-forming ability of bacteria (O’Toole et al., 2000; Jackson et al., 2002; Huang et al., 2013; HuiQiu et al., 2013). Here we reported that the tetR gene in a gene cluster of A. avenae subsp. avenae also affected its biofilm-forming ability. To access expression level of biofilm-forming associated genes, we employed LC-MS/MS analysis and real-time PCR study, and found activation of an array of flagellar genes and clpAB genes in the absence of TetR (Tables S2 and S3, Figure 6). On the other hand, the proteins down-regulated (such as methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase and MinC) in the tetR mutant, mainly belong to bacterial catabolic pathways and regulator of cell division and growth (Tables S2 and S3; Höschle et al., 2005; Aguilar et al., 2008; Bramkamp and van Baarle, 2009; Lutkenhaus, 2009). In particular, the decreased minC gene expression can cause slower cell growth, which may help bacteria to withstand arduous conditions. These results also provide evidence supporting the role of TetR as a positive regulator of genes promoting cell growth. As a transcriptional regulator, the TetR protein binds to the promoter of the gene cluster directly, as EMSA showed (Figure 7). Mutation of the tetR gene resulted in activation of the pqiAA’B genes, suggesting that TetR negatively controls the transcript levels of pqiAA’B. This result is consistent with our observations that the mutant displayed increased levels of resistance to paraquat and H2O2. With the exception of TetR regulator, there are some other known regulators associated with oxidative stress regulation, such as OxyR or PerR. Although similar properties make them functionally analogous with each other, genetic evidence revealed that they have much difference on protein structures and functional mechanisms. OxyR, a member of the LysR family, is a well-characterized positive regulator of the adaptive response to H2O2 stress in E. coli and in Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (Zheng et al., 1998; Helmann, 2002), and a negative regulator of catalase expression in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Tseng et al., 2003). Recently, more researches have shifted to favor a model for OxyR activation. It was believed a specific disulfide bond formation was required in the oxidative activation of OxyR, rather than being chemically modified by individual cysteine (Cys) residues (Helmann, 2002; Lee et al., 2004). PerR is a metal-dependent peroxide sensors that regulate inducible peroxide-defense genes, such as catalase gene katA, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase gene ahpCF (Horsburgh et al., 2001; Lee and Helmann, 2006). PerR is as well required for virulence and iron storage proteins in Staphylococcus aureus (Horsburgh et al., 2001). These features separate PerR functionally and mechanistically from TetR and OxyR regulators. Here, we did not find the TetR controlling virulence in A. avenae subsp. avenae by observing symptoms and analyzing lesion lengths 14 days post-inoculation (Figure S5). Most of the fully identified and characterized TetR-family repressors were associated with biosynthesis of antibiotics, eﬄux pumps, and osmotic stress (Aramaki et al., 1993, 1995). As a regulator of adaptive response to H2O2 stress, it was not known whether paraquat or H2O2 was the direct modulator for TetR protein activity. Future studies are required to cope with this question. It is well-known that there is a balance between different factors contributing to fitness in bacteria. The trade-off hypothesis in pathogen evolution states that higher benefit in one aspect is correlated to lower benefit in another aspect (Alizon et al., 2009). Based on the trade-off hypothesis, there must be undesirable side effects derived from over-expression of the TetR-regulated genes. Our results showed that over-expression of the TetR-regulated genes in the tetR mutant led to low cell growth rate under non-oxidative stress conditions. In favorable growth conditions, fast growth would be more important to bacteria than keeping its defense heightened. TetR is a repressor in the operon to regulate the pqiAA’B genes to achieve the balance between fast growth and resistance to arduous surroundings. This feedback mechanism is of high flexibility, which is important to bacterial adaptability. TetR-like repressors, such as PrqR, Aur1R, EthR and CifR, with similar mechanisms are also found in other bacteria (Babykin et al., 2003; Engohang-Ndong et al., 2004; MacEachran et al., 2008; Novakova et al., 2010). In Vibrio cholerae, HapR (another TetR regulator) is found to play a positive role on detachment of V. cholerae to the gastrointestinal epithelium as well as a negative effect on biofilm formation (Silva et al., 2003). We still don’t know exactly the positive role of the tetR gene. However, based on the differential protein profiles between tetR mutant and wild-type strain, we hypothesize that TetR also plays positive roles, including promoting cell growth. More research is needed to reveal other physiological roles of TetR.Conflict of Interest Statement The Review Editor Yuejin Hua declares that, despite being affiliated to the same institution as authors He Liu, Chun-Lan Yang, Meng-Yu Ge, Muhammad Ibrahim, Bin Li, Bo Zhu and Guan-Lin Xie, the review process was handled objectively and no conflict of interest exists.

This study reports our findings from the application of a weekly dialysis schedule plus less severe protein restriction (standard low-protein low-phosphorus diet) in stage 5 CKD patients with consistent dietary discipline. This is a multicenter, prospective controlled study, including 68 incident CKD patients followed in a pre-dialysis clinic with Glomerular Filtration Rate 5 to 10 ml/min/1.73/ m2 who became unstable on the only medical treatment. They were offered to begin a Combined Diet Dialysis Program (CDDP) or a standard thrice-a-week hemodialysis (THD): 38 patients joined the CDDP, whereas 30 patients chose THD. Patients were studied at baseline, 6 and 12 months; hospitalization and survival rate were followed-up for 24 months. Volume output and residual renal function were maintained in the CDDP Group while those features dropped quickly in THD Group. Throughout the study, CDDP patients had a lower erythropoietin resistance index, lower β2 microglobulin levels and lower need for cinacalcet of phosphate binders than THD, and stable parameters of nutritional status. At 24 month follow-up, 39.4% of patients were still on CDDP; survival rates were 94.7% and 86.8% for CDDP and THD patients, respectively, but hospitalization rate was much higher in THD than in CDDP patients. The cost per patient per year resulted significantly lower in CDDP than in THD Group. This study shows that a CDDP served to protect the residual renal function, to maintain urine volume output and to preserve a good nutritional status. CDDP also blunted the rapid β2 microglobulin increase and resulted in better control of anemia and calcium-phosphate abnormalities. CDDP was also associated with a lower hospitalization rate and reduced need of erythropoietin, as well as of drugs used for treatment of calcium-phosphate abnormalities, thus leading to a significant cost-saving. We concluded that in selected ESRD patients with preserved urine output attitude to protein restriction, CDDP may be a beneficial choice for an incremental hemodialysis program.

Background The Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is on an upward trend worldwide. Since the 1990s incidence has risen by approximately 40% per decade, with prevalence rates in the general adult population up to 13% in the USA and ranging 10.2-11.6% in Europe [1–4]. These figures indicate a CKD epidemic leading to an increased number of patients requiring dialysis and a heavy burden on public health resources. Nutritional and pharmacological therapy constitute the basis for the prevention and treatment of signs and symptoms of CKD, and they serve to delay the commencement of dialysis. The appropriate time to start dialysis is still a matter of debate. In particular, dialysis is not superior that conservative treatment especially in the comorbid-elderly population. It is known that a standard thrice--weekly hemodialysis schedule invariably leads to rapid loss of the residual renal function, to psychological and socials drawbacks, and to high costs. Real incremental dialysis programs are implemented in peritoneal dialysis but not in the hemodialysis setting where only a twice -weekly schedule may be proposed prior to maintenance hemodialysis. During the 1980’s and 1990’s, an Integrated Diet Dialysis Program (IDDP) was proposed as a therapeutic option for selected patients with markedly reduced residual renal function and it consisted of weekly hemodialysis session (HD) combined with nutritional therapy, namely a very low-protein diet supplemented with ketoacids [5–8]. Malnutrition risk and low compliance to the severe dietary restrictions represented major concerns that prevented a widespread application of this schedule. In the present study we propose a Combined Diet Dialysis Program (CDDP) which includes a less severe low protein (0.6 g/Kg/d) diet combined with once-weekly hemodialysis. The goal is to prolong a conservative approach and thus reduce the need for hemodialysis, thereby limiting the risk of malnutrition and of poor dietary adherence. This study aimed to assess the safety, benefits and drawbacks of the CDDP approach including nutritional status, residual renal function, morbidity, mortality and costs.Methods This is a multicenter, non-randomized, prospective controlled study, including stage V CKD patients followed in a pre-dialysis clinic who were not suitable for a peritoneal dialysis program. Patients with GFR 5 to 10 ml/min who were approaching hemodialysis treatment and who had vascular access were included in the study. Global criteria of starting dialysis and then for entering the study were fluid retention, inadequate control of BUN or severe secondary hyperparathyroidism or hyperphosphatemia, reduced compliance to dietary treatment. Patients with pericarditis, congestive heart failure, severe fluid retention, overt protein-energy wasting, hyperkalemia or severe metabolic acidosis with acute reduction of residual renal function or concurrent diseases were excluded, as well patients with unreliable discipline with regards to dietary restrictions were treated at once with maintenance hemodialysis and then excluded from the study. During the pre-dialysis phase, patients were followed in a tertiary care CKD clinic every two-three months (stage 4) or on a monthly basis (stage 5). Compliance to dietary and pharmacological treatment was acceptable, as assessed by urinary urea excretion and by dietary recall and interview. Sixty-eight incident patients were recruited and all the patients were provided a functioning native artero-venous fistula or graft. Underlying kidney diseases included mainly hypertension/vascular nephropathy, ADPKD. The patients were offered the choice to commence a weekly hemodialysis schedule plus low-protein diet on the non-dialysis day (namely, CDDP), or to begin a standard thrice- weekly hemodialysis (THD) schedule and free-choice diet. All the patients were informed and directly involved in the decision making process. Randomization was not applied since any dietary regimen requires adherence and motivation. According to their own choice, 38 patients entered in the CDDP Group, whereas the remaining 30 patients formed the THD control group. The clinical and biochemical features of the two groups at baseline are reported in Table 1. At baseline, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease history was similar in CDDP (28.9%) and in THD (30%) group. Six type 2 diabetics were included in CDDP group and 13 in THD group.Table 1 Baseline characteristics of the studied groups CDDP group (n = 38)THD group (n = 30)pMale/females25/1319/11Age, years64.5 ± 13.265.2 ± 11 0.82 Body weight (kg)65.5 ± 15.166.2 ± 11.9 0.73 BMI (kg/m2)23.7 ± 4.025.6 ± 4.13 0.03 Urine volume output (mL/24 h)1983 ± 6511472.6 ± 433 <0.001 GFR (mL/min × 1.73 mq b.s)7.8 ± 1.99.2 ± 4.2 <0.01 EPO (IU/kg/week)104 ± 108184 ± 84 <0.001 CRP <5 mg/dl, %8966.6 <0.01 iPTH, >300 ρg/mL, %31.550 <0.01 Charlson comorbidity index score5.5 ± 2.53.8 ± 2.5 0.004 Charlson comorbidity index score >4, %62.533.3 <0.01 All the patients were studied at baseline, and after 6 and 12 months. The survival rate and hospitalization rate were followed up to 24 months. Blood samples were collected from the arterial line before the start of the first dialysis of the week; 24h urines were collected during the day before the HD session. GFR was measured as the average of creatinine clearance and urea clearance, and expressed as ml/min*1.73 m2 body surface area [9]; eGFR was also estimated by MDRD formula [10]. Protein catabolic rate (PCR) was used as an indicator of dietary protein intake and calculated by the urea appearance method according to Maroni’s formula [11]. Maroni’s formula was used throughout the course of the CDDP and only at baseline time in patients in the THD Group. Within the THD Group, for patients with the significant loss of renal function and urine output volume we included the method of urea kinetics model for estimation of nPCR. Dialytic adequacy was expressed using eKt/V according to Daugirdas formula et al [12]. Body mass index was calculated by the body weight at the end of the dialysis session. The bioelectrical parameters, were measured with a single-frequency impedance analyzer (BIA 101 – Akern - Florence), 30’ after the end of the hemodialysis session. Erythropoietin Resistance Index (ERI) was calculated as weekly EPO dosage (units)/body weight (Kg)/Hb (g/dl) [13]. Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI) score, was calculated to evaluate comorbidity conditions [14]. Creatinine production, as a surrogate of muscle mass, was calculated by the sum of 24h urine creatinine excretion and metabolized creatinine. Metabolized creatinine was calculated from the product of serum creatinine and extrarenal Creatinine clearance (estimated as 0.038 L/kg BW/d) [7]. All the patients on CDDP underwent nutritional counseling by a renal dietician and were prescribed a low protein (0,6 g/kg b.w./d), low phosphorus (600–700 mg/d), low sodium diet with an energy intake of 30–35 kcal/kg b.w./d. Proteins were mostly from animal sources (0.4 g/Kg/b.w.), to cover the requirement of essential amino acids; no dairy or processed foods are included to the aim of limiting the sodium and phosphorus intake; [15] protein-free products are included to supply energy with negligible load of phosphorus, sodium, potassium and nitrogen [16]. The 60–62% of energy intake derived from carbohydrates (mostly represented by protein-free products), 30–32% from lipids and 8-10% from proteins. As average, the daily dietary plan consisted of 5–7 servings of protein free products, namely 2–3 serving for breakfast and snacks and 2 servings for both lunch and dinner; the patients were usually advised that they can add other servings, when required to satisfy the energy requirement. The servings of animal protein sources (meat, fish, egg white) were calculated for each patient in order to guarantee a daily total amount of 0.4 g protein per kg b.w. Two servings of vegetables and two of fruits were provided with specific suggestions for patients with high potassium levels as well as boiling was suggested to reduce to mineral content (potassium, sodium, calcium, and phosphorus) of food. Finally, 5–6 servings of fats (olive oil as first choice) were suggested. This diet was prescribed for 6 days a week, while no dietary restrictions occurred on the dialysis day. Patients in the THD control group followed an unrestricted protein diet, but they were given dietary counseling focused on preventing excess sodium, potassium, phosphorus and fluid intakes. All the patients were prescribed 4-hour hemodialysis sessions with highly biocompatible synthetic membranes. The study protocol was approved by the Cagliari Hospital Ethics Committee, and all the patients gave their written informed consent for participation in the study.Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics is given as mean ± standard deviation. Normality tests were performed on all continuous variables measured throughout the study. The log-rank test was used for hypothesis testing. Time repeated measurements were analyzed using linear mixed models including treatment, time, and treatment by time interaction for all measured variables using ANOVA. Inter-group drug use was compared by means of the binomial test with Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered as statistically significant when p <0.05.Results Patients who entered the CDDP showed several differences with respect to patients who commenced THD (Table 1). Despite a lower residual renal function (RRF), CDDP patients showed lower circulating levels of phosphate, BUN, PTH and higher albumin levels with respect to THD patients. 34 out of the 38 patients were still on CDDP at 12 months: 2 patients were shifted to a thrice- weekly dialysis schedule at 8 and 10 months, while 2 patients partially recovered their renal function and remained clinically stable with the low-protein diet and no need for dialysis. During the study period, GFR was preserved in CDDP patients in comparison to THD group (Table 2). GFR loss progression was very low in the former (-0.13 ml/min/month) while it was faster in the latter (-1.53 ml/min/month). Similarly, in the CDDP group an effective urine volume output was maintained whereas it dramatically dropped in the THD patients (Figure 1a). As a consequence, the interdialytic weight gain in CDDP patients was limited to (800 ± 300 g) per week.

No difference in arterial blood pressure values emerged between the two groups. The main nutritional indicators, i.e. total protein, albumin and transferrin improved significantly in the CDDP group (Figure 1b, Table 2). Estimated dietary protein intake remained stable in the CDDP groups throughout the study (from 0.58 ± 0.2 to 0.57 ± 0.11 g/kg/day). This was also the case for THD patients (from 1.03 ± 0.1 to 1.04 ± 0.3 g/kg/day). No significative changes in body weight or Body Mass Index (BMI) were recorded in the two groups (Table 2). A significant reduction in the ESAs requirement was observed in the CDDP group along with markedly lower ERI values (Table 3).Table 3 Biochemistry parameters in CDDP and THD groups at 6 and 12 months CDDP groupTHD groupBaseline (n = 38)6 months (n = 38)12 months (n = 34)Baseline (n = 30)6 months (n = 30)12 months (n = 29)P Triglycerides (mg/dL) 109 ± 36134 ± 92126 ± 50131 ± 72152 ± 67139 ± 52 0.03 Total Cholesterol (mg/dL) 164 ± 36168 ± 36164 ± 35165 ± 41168.5 ± 34170 ± 40 0.51 HDL Cholesterol (mg/dL) 44 ± 1447 ± 1348 ± 2044 ± 1245 ± 1344 ± 12 0.58 LDL Cholesterol (mg/dL) 101 ± 2993 ± 3493 ± 3195 ± 3293 ± 2997.8 ± 34 0.95 Cholinesterases (UI/mL) 5474 ± 13966073 ± 1474586 ± 16464968 ± 14885511 ± 16044673 ± 1450b 0.27 Uric acid (mg/dL) 7.3 ± 2.37.5 ± 2.47.1 ± 1.96.4 ± 1.8b 7.3 ± 1.27.2 ± 1.3b 0.60 Sodium (mmol/L) 139 ± 2.6137 ± 3.6137 ± 4.0138 ± 2.7138 ± 2.3134 ± 3.3 0.58 Potassium (mmol/L) 4.4 ± 0.64.3 ± 0.64.3 ± 0.74.3 ± 0,674.7 ± 0.74.8 ± 0.9b 0.07 Calcium (mg/dL) 9.2 ± 0.59.0 ± 0.59.1 ± 0.69.1 ± 0.69.1 ± 0.79.0 ± 0.5 0.51 Phosphatemia (mg/dL) 4.4 ± 0.94.6 ± 0.84.6 ± 0.85.1 ± 1.55.6 ± 1.15.2 ± 1.1 0.001 Bicarbonate (mEq/L) 22.0 ± 3.123.1 ± 3.323.2 ± 3.221.8 ± 4.221.9 ± 3.221.6 ± 2.7 0.17 β2-microglobulin (mg/dL) 14.2 ± 3.916.8 ± 5.716.0 ± 5.118.4 ± 11.631.0 ± 16.028.0 ± 11.4b 0.007 Hb (g/dl) 10.8 ± 0.111.5 ± 0.9511.5 ± 0.97a 10.5 ± 1.411.3 ± 0.911.2 ± 0.95a 0.31 EPO (IU/kg/week)104 ± 10869 ± 5960 ± 74b 184 ± 84172 ± 138204 ± 252 0.002 ERI (IU/kg/week)/Hb10 ± 116 ± 55 ± 7b 19 ± 1015 ± 1319 ± 23 <0.001 CRP (% patients) <5.0 8981.57966.683.376.6 <0.05 CRP (mg/dL) 3.3 ± 3.93.5 ± 3.33.2 ± 3.68.6 ± 9.74.9 ± 6.55.8 ± 5.8 <0.01 iPTH (ρg/mL) <150 (%) 39.552.65236.743.334.5 0.09 iPTH (ρg/mL) 150–300 (%) 29293013.32027.6 0.26 iPTH (ρg/mL) >300 (%) 31.5a 18.418a 5036.737.9 0.02 Changes versus baseline: ap < 0.01; bp < 0.03; P: ANOVA significance for treatment by time interaction.

So their use began after commencing dialysis (even once-a-week): patients on THD showed a secondary hyperparathyroidism more severe than patients on CDDP , consequently the need of calcimimetics was higher in the former than in the latter. No significant reduction in creatinine production was observed after 12 months of CDDP (16.8 ± 4.3 vs. 15.9 ± 3.9 mg/Kg/d).Hospitalization Throughout the 24 month follow-up period, 3 CDDP patients were admitted to hospital for a total of 11 days (3.7 ± 1.5 days/patient) due to atrial fibrillation, acute bronchitis and acute cholecystitis. Instead 24 hospital admission were recorded in 15 patients of THD groups for a total of 147 days (6.1 ± 6.3 days/patient). Causes for admission were: set up of new vascular access (7), artero-venous fistula stenosis angioplasty (1), infection of central vein catheter (2), acute pulmonary edema (1), surgery for biological prosthetic valve (1), myocardial infarction (1), valvular and coronaropathy angioplasty (2), congestive heart failure (1), atrial fibrillation (2), hyperpyrexia (1), hypertensive crisis (1), hypoglycemic coma (1), abscess in thigh hematoma (1) and obstructive jaundice secondary to gallstones (2).Survival At the 24-month follow-up, no significant difference was detected between the CDDP and THD group survival rates: 94.7% and 86.8% respectively (Figure 2).Figure 2 Cumulative survival in CDDP group (Dotted line) and in THD Group (Full line). Death in 3 CDDP patients was caused by cardiac events: 1 during the 13th, 1 during the 16th and 1 during the 18th month of CDDP. Four deaths occurred in the THD group: 1 in the 9th, 2 in the 13th and 1 in the 22nd month following start of dialysis. Causes included myocardial infarction and acute heart failure, sepsis and stroke.CDDP global outcome At 12 months 34 out of the 38 patients (89.5%) were on CDDP. At 24 months, 15 patients were still on CDDP (39.4%) since 1 patient received a kidney transplant, 3 patients had fatal myocardial infarction, whereas 17 patients have progressed to an incremental dialysis program (namely twice to thrice-weekly dialysis and free-protein diet) and 2 patients partially recovered their renal function. The main reasons for dropping out were loss of dietary adherence and/or reduction of residual renal function. When compared to THD group, CDDP patients registered a lower number of hospitalizations and a lower need for expensive drugs. These findings, coupled with the 66% reduction in number of dialysis sessions (52 versus 156 sessions in THD Group in a year) allows to estimated that the cost of a CDDP patient is more than 60% less than that of a THD patient.Discussion This study shows that in selected ESRD patients, a CDDP is able to protect the RRF, to maintain urine volume output, to preserve a good nutritional status, to blunt the rapid β2 microglobulin increase, and to allow better control of anemia and calcium-phosphate abnormalities. CDDP is also associated with a lower rate of hospitalization , reduced need of EPO and drugs used for the CKD-MBD treatment, thus leading to a significant cost-saving. CCDP may be considered as the first step of an incremental approach to hemodialysis treatment of ESRD. Patients who entered the CDDP showed a better control of phosphatemia, BUN, PTH levels and higher albumin levels despite a lower RRF. It suggests that patients who had maintained consistent adherence to dietary treatment chose the CDDP whereas THD was chosen by patients with poor compliance to dietary prescriptions. In fact, dietary discipline is the first pre-requisite for a safe and successful CDDP. In the CDDP group an effective urine volume output was maintained whereas it dramatically dropped in the THD patients. As a consequence, the interdialytic weight gain in CDDP patients was quite small, thus allowing low intradialytic ultrafiltration volumes. In turn, this may contribute to further preservation of the residual renal function and to limit cardiovascular damage. When compared to THD, CDDP was not associated with greater mortality risk (Figure 2) and hospitalization rate was much lower. One of the main goals of the CKD patients care is to preserve RRF as long as possible because it is of very favorable prognostic value. The majority of patients succeeded in sticking to CDDP for at least one year ensuring a good nutritional status and maintaining GFR (-1.56 ml/min/year); in stage 4–5 CKD Levin et al. reported a GFR loss of 2.6 ml/min/year [17]. Three major studies investigated once a-weekly dialysis coupled with low protein regimens in ESRD patients [5–8]. Mitch et al. reported that combined diet-dialysis treatment resulted in a decrease in urea production with a positive nitrogen balance during interdialytic interval [5]. Patients studied by Giovannetti et al. showed no uremic symptoms even after years of IDDP despite an extremely low RRF, thus indicating that the nutritional therapy is a major factor preventing the onset of uremic symptoms [6]. The studies carried out by Locatelli et al. concluded that IDDP may be very important from a psychological and economic point of view, but concerns arose about compliance and long-term nutritional and depurative adequacy [7]. After a 4-year period they found a reduction of creatinine generation rate, possibly suggesting a reduction in muscle mass. This was not confirmed in our patients where the CDDP differs from the similar strategies proposed in the 1980’s and 1990’s [6, 7]; the treatment is distinguished by less severe residual renal function from among patients, less severe protein restriction, and by closer nutritional monitoring. In addition, hemodialysis sessions were performed with high quality water and highly bio-compatible membranes [18–21]. Retrospective and prospective studies failed to demonstrate any benefits, in terms of survival, for an early onset of dialysis. In 2010 the first randomized, controlled trial of early versus late initiation of dialysis reported that early access to dialysis (eGFR > 7 ml/min/1.73 m2) provided no statistically significant benefits in terms of patient survival [22]. The role played by RRF in the clearance of medium-sized molecules such as β2-microglobulin is well-known (Figure 1c). Accordingly, patients with a significant RRF manifest lower levels of β2-microglobulin. On commencing CDDP, maintenance of effective urine output volume, a better hyperparathyroidism control, and a good nutritional status may have produced a positive effect on erythropoiesis leading to better anemia correction with reduction of ERI [23–25]. Our findings are in keeping with those of Di Iorio et al. who demonstrated that a poorer response to EPO was related to secondary hyperparathyroidism [23]. At baseline, in 50% of THD patients PTH was >300 pg/ml with significantly higher serum phosphate levels and a significantly lower use of calcimimetic drugs compared to CDDP Group (Tables 3 and 4). During the study, CDDP patients had no need for additional dialysis sessions. In turn, an easy volumes balance with quite low interdialytic weight gains, and prevention of high ultrafiltration rates and of intradialytic hypotension, contribute to the protection of RRF during CDDP. Moreover, Fouque et al. showed that dietary treatment produced a positive effect in delaying the need of dialysis [26]. It is noteworthy that the hospitalization rate in CDDP was much lower than in THD Group. In the latter, the causes of admission were mainly vascular access complications and infection. In addition the overall 2 year-survival rate of CDDP was similar to that of THD patients. In fact, data from literature show that a conservative approach may be not inferior to dialysis in elderly ESRD patients, in terms of survival and/or quality of life [27–29]. Lastly, the CDDP treatment resulted in an approximate 50% savings on the cost of drugs and dialysis resources, including a lower number of dialysis hours/nursing and medical staff ( 66% less compared to thrice-weekly hemodialysis) and comorbid incidence in terms of days of hospitalization, as well as of indirect costs such as transport of patients to and from the dialysis unit. When compared to THD, the CDDP group showed a lower hospitalization rate, lower need for expensive drugs, and by definition a 66% lowering of number of dialysis sessions and related costs. CDDP patients may have the additional cost of the protein-free products. As a whole, CDDP seems to be a safe and effective exit strategy for lowering the cost of ESRD population, even if it can occur for a limited period of time and in selected ESRD patients. Another advantage of CDDP is an improvement in patient’s acceptance and adaptation to renal replacement therapy. The patient feels less sick and less machine-dependent, resulting in an increased copying capacity (or psychological adaptation). Patients moreover tended to adapt better to low protein diets thanks to a more varied diet, as well as to address concerns about “dialysis-day”, which was also the day they were allowed to eat a “normal” diet. The study has not had the opportunity to randomize and this may be seen as a limitation, but randomization was not feasible because one could not force patients to choose one method rather than the other. Patients were followed in pre-dialysis care: a multidisciplinary clinic (doctors, nurses, dietitians and psychologists) was able to provide the necessary education and choice of treatment modalities. This study aimed to reproduce the real world clinical practice where patient’s adherence is a crucial issue for the success of any treatment, especially if dietary in nature, where patients play an active role and must be involved in the decision-making process. Patients who entered the CDDP showed a lower residual renal function but better control of phosphatemia, BUN, PTH levels and higher albumin levels. This finding suggests that CDDP is suitable for patients who still have a positive inclination towards dietary manipulations. Moreover, together with a preserved urine output volume, good compliance to dietary prescriptions is mandatory and a pre-requisite for the success and safety of CDDP. Now it could be necessary to begin considering a tailored dialytic treatment and to evaluate the greater power of RRF. The incremental choice is considered a good option in peritoneal patients since the 2000’s [30, 31] thanks to RRF and it again underestimates for twice-weekly HD patients [32, 33]. Energy-adequate low-protein regimens have a fundamental role in controlling and maintaining a good metabolic status and in reducing GFR loss [26, 34].Conclusions This study shows that in selected ESRD patients, a CDDP is able to protect the RRF, to maintain urine volume output, to preserve a good nutritional status , to blunt the rapid β2 microglobulin increase, and to allow better control of anemia and calcium-phosphate abnormalities. CDDP is also associated with a lower rate of hospitalization and reduced need of EPO and drugs used for the CKD-MBD treatment, thus leading to a significant cost-saving. As a whole, our findings suggest that CDDP could be a beneficial choice for selected collaborative patients who would otherwise be referred to thrice-weekly hemodialysis. CCDP should be considered as the first step of an incremental approach to hemodialysis treatment in motivated and selected ESRD patients, or anywhere dialysis facilities and resources are lacking.	
1995-07-02T07:00:00Z	1995-7-2	7615641	2199930							95340642				Recent studies have demonstrated that inhibition of mevalonate synthesis in cultured cells leads to altered cell morphology due to inhibition of protein prenylation. To investigate the effects in vivo of mevalonate deprivation in nondividing, terminally differentiated neural cells, we have analyzed the effects on retinal tissue of intravitreal injection of lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of the mevalonate-producing enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase. A single injection of lovastatin (0.25 mumol) produced profound dysplastic-like changes in adult rat retinas primarily involving the photoreceptor layer. Within 2 d after injection, photoreceptor nuclei migrated in a circular pattern resulting in the formation of rosette-like structures by 4 d. Also during this period, photoreceptor inner and outer segment degeneration was evident. By 21 d, intact photoreceptor nuclei with remnants of inner and outer segments were dispersed throughout all retinal layers. To investigate the biochemical specificity of the lovastatin-induced alterations, and to distinguish the relative importance of the various branches of the mevalonate pathway, the incorporation of [3H]acetate into retinal lipids was examined in the presence and absence of metabolic inhibitors. HPLC analysis of lovastatin-treated retinas revealed a dramatic reduction in the incorporation of intravitreally injected [3H]acetate into nonsaponifiable lipids, compared with controls. In contrast, intravitreal injection of NB-598, a specific inhibitor of squalene epoxidase, eliminated the conversion of newly synthesized squalene to sterols without obvious pathology. Hence, involvement to the sterol branch of isoprenoid metabolism in the lovastatin-induced morphologic disruption was obviated. Intravitreal injection of 0.27 mumol of N-acetyl-S-trans,trans-farnesyl-L-cysteine (AFC), an inhibitor of carboxyl methyltransferase activity and prenylated protein function, produced morphologic changes that were virtually indistinguishable from those induced with lovastatin. These results implicate a defect in protein prenylation in the lovastatin- induced retinal degeneration, and suggest the presence of a dynamic pathway in the retina that requires isoprenylated proteins to maintain retinal cytoarchitecture.

INTRODUCTION Zolpidem is extensively prescribed as a hypnotic in clinical practice, both in the form of a standard oral tablet (Ambien®) and a controlled-release tablet (Rosenberg, 2006; Soubrane et al., 2005). In either case, it is to be ingested at bedtime with an available 7–8 h of time in bed because of its potential for next-morning residual effects on memory and psychomotor performance following shorter periods of bedtime (Partinen et al., 2003; Verster et al., 2002). A different, low-dose sublingual transmucosal formulation of zolpidem (ST zolpidem, Intermezzo™) is currently under investigation as a sedative-hypnotic with rapid onset and short duration of action for the treatment of insomnia patients whose primary complaint is difficulty returning to sleep after middle-of-the-night awakening (Roth et al., 2006). This formulation consists of sublingual lozenges designed for transmucosal delivery of zolpidem. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in healthy volunteers after daytime administration, the pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and tolerability of ST zolpidem lozenges compared to placebo.METHODSStudy design This study was a single-dose, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, daytime, cross-over study. Three doses of ST zolpidem (1.0, 1.75, and 3.5 mg) were compared with matching placebo in healthy volunteers. The protocol for this study was approved by an institutional review board for the study site and the study itself was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Subjects were paid for their participation. Subject selection included a clinical assessment visit and 7 days of morning sleep diary screening to ensure that all study criteria were met. Subjects were randomized to one of four treatment sequences, which included all three doses of active treatment and placebo. Each treatment period consisted of 2 days separated by a washout period of 5–12 days. During each of the four treatment periods, subjects were admitted to the site on the evening prior to dosing and had an obligatory 8 h in bed. The following two mornings, subjects were awakened at a fixed time and, following baseline assessments, received the study drug at 8:00 AM (approximately 1 h after awakening). PD assessments were conducted prior to dosing and over a period of 5 h after study drug administration on the first morning of treatment. On the second morning, the same treatment was administered and venous blood was drawn prior to dosing and over a period of 12 h following study treatment administration for PK evaluation. In each treatment period, subject mobility was limited. Specifically, for the first 5 h after dose administration, participants were required to remain seated unless medically or procedurally necessary. Furthermore, subjects were kept awake until all procedures were completed. Subjects had to pass a heel-to-toe gait test prior to leaving the laboratory.Subject recruitment and selection Healthy, non-smoking adult men and women, aged 21–44 with no current self-reported sleeping problems were eligible for participation in the study. After signing a written informed consent statement and following initial screening, a physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram, subjects were invited to complete a 7-day sleep diary provided that they did not (1) have any DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders or any circadian rhythm sleep disorder, (2) have a history of substance abuse or substance dependence, (3) have a Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of greater than 12, (4) have had an acute clinically significant illness or surgery, including oral surgery, tooth extraction, or piercing of the lip/tongue within 60 days prior to Day 1 of the study, (5) utilize any over-the-counter or prescription medication within 2 weeks prior to screening, or (6) take any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism within 30 days prior to Day 1 of double-blind study medication. Subjects qualified for randomization if their diaries reported a mean weekly latency to sleep onset of ≤30 min, a mean weekly total time in bed of ≥7 h, and a stable bedtime pattern as defined by a usual bedtime between 2200 and 2400 and a usual rise time between 0500 and 0800 (neither of which varied by more than 2 h on 5 of 7 nights).Study procedures Study drug. The four treatments evaluated were 1.0, 1.75, and 3.5 mg ST zolpidem and placebo lozenges. Subjects were randomized into dosing sequences of four treatment periods (Latin Square) that were separated by 5–12 days. Each subject was randomized into a dosing sequence that included all four treatments. Medication was dispensed by study personnel on each morning in the sleep laboratory at 8 AM. Subjects were instructed to rinse their mouth with water prior to dosing and then place the lozenge under their tongue until it dissolved. Saliva was swallowed every 2min until the nearest 2 min after complete lozenge dissolution. Study personnel performed oral cavity examinations before and after dosing to ensure consumption of medication and to note any signs of oral irritation. PD assessments. Subjects practiced PD tests after admission to the laboratory on the night prior to treatment. On the first morning of each treatment period, subjects performed the PD tests immediately before dosing and at 10 min [visual analog scale (VAS) only], 20 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 h post-dose. PD tests were always performed in the same order: Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Choice Reaction Test (CRT), Symbol Copying Test (SCT), subject rating of sedation (VAS) and Word Recall Test. During the DSST (Kaplan et al., 1997), subjects were given a set of symbols with corresponding single digit numbers and a set of ‘blank’ boxes with corresponding digits. Subjects were asked to make as many symbol-for-digit substitutions as possible working from left to right without skipping any boxes within a 90-s period and the number of correct substitutions was recorded. Throughout the study, subjects completed equivalent DSST variants, with no individual taking the same form more than once. For the CRT (Roehrs et al., 1994), subjects were provided with a hand-held device with response buttons for measuring reaction time following the presentation of visual and/or audio stimulus. Response time was defined as the time in milliseconds between the onset of the stimulus and the response button being pressed. The mean response time, the number of errors, and the number of lapses (defined as reaction time >500 ms) were evaluated. During the SCT (Stone, 1984), subjects were given a sheet filled with double rows: the upper row filled with symbols, the lower row empty. Subjects were asked to make as many accurate symbol-copies as possible working from left to right without skipping any boxes within a 90-s period and the number of correct copies was recorded. Throughout the study, subjects completed equivalent SCT variants, with no individual taking the same form more than once. Finally, acquisition and immediate recall of information was evaluated using a word-list free recall procedure (Shader et al., 1986). Fifteen words were read in random order at a rate of one word per second, during each test session. Recall was tested immediately after presentation of the list, and subjects were given 1 min to write down list items recalled in any order. Throughout the study, subjects had to recall equivalent word-list variants, with no individual hearing the same list more than once. The number of correct words (ignoring spelling mistakes) was recorded. Subjective ratings. Subjects' self-ratings of sedative effects were obtained on a 100mm VAS anchored by ‘0’ = ‘very sleepy’ and 100' = ‘wide awake and alert’. This type of VAS scale is often used in clinical trials to assay sedative effects (typically as residual effects in the morning). PK sample collection and parameters. On the second morning of the treatment period, a total of 18 blood samples were collected. The first sample was collected prior to dosing. Subsequent samples were collected at 5, 10, 20, 30, and 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h post-dose. All blood samples were centrifuged within 10 min and plasma was separated, divided into two duplicate aliquots, and frozen until the time of assay. The bioanalytical laboratory analyzed zolpidem in plasma samples using a validated LC/ MS/MS method. PK parameters included the area under the plasma concentration curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC0-t), the area under the plasma concentration curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-inf), the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), the time of the maximum plasma concentration (tmax), and the apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2).Safety evaluations Vital signs were recorded at screening, prior to dosing and at scheduled intervals during each treatment period. Subjects oral cavities were examined for buccal irritation prior to dosing, at the time of lozenge dissolution, at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min post-dissolution and at discharge. A physical examination along with chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis were performed at study entry and prior to discharge in the fourth treatment period. All subjects had to pass a heel-to-toe gait test before leaving the clinic.Statistical analysis All analyses performed in this study were defined prior to breaking the study blind. All randomized subjects completed all four treatment periods. Therefore, the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations were identical. The statistical analyses discussed reflect the full set of 24 randomized patients. PD values are presented and analyzed as change relative to pre-dose values. Each time point was evaluated separately relative to the baseline value. In addition, area under the time-effect curve for the effect change scores was calculated for defined time intervals. PK parameters were calculated from the concentration–time data using non-compartmental techniques. Using SAS, ANOVA was performed on untransformed tmax and t1/2, and on ln-transformed dose normalized values of AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax at the alpha level of 0.05. Linearity in PK response of various doses was assessed by applying the power function P = A*Doseb to non-normalized Cmax and AUC0-t values of zolpidem. Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), vital signs, and laboratory parameters. AEs were defined according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). AEs with onset (or worsening) after the start of study drug were considered treatment-emergent. The frequency of treatmentemergent AEs and the frequency of events by body system were summarized by treatment period according to preferred term and system organ class.RESULTSDemographics A total of 24 subjects were randomized to treatment for this study. All participants completed all four treatment periods; there were no discontinuations. The demographics and sleep histories of the subject population are detailed in Tables 1 and 2. As can be seen, study subjects were healthy and reported no sleep difficulties.Table 1 Subject demographicsGenderMale (%)13 (54.2)Female (%)11 (45.8)RaceCaucasian (%)15 (62.5)African-American (%)9 (32.5)AgeMean (SD)34.7 (7.1)Range21–44Weight (kg)Mean (SD)74.4 (10.8)Range51.7–100.2BMIMean (SD)24.9 (2.8)Range19–30Table 2 Subject sleep historyUsual time in bed (h)Mean (SD)8.2 (0.4)Range8.0–9.0Usual time to fall asleep (min)Mean (SD)13.0 (5.4)Range3.0–25.0Usual sleep time during night (h)Mean (SD)8.1 (0.4)Range7.5–9.0Usual time awake during night (min)Mean (SD)2.3 (2.8)Range0.0–10.0Usual number of nocturnal awakenings01311021Epworth sleepiness scaleMean (SD)3.5 (2.6)Range0.0–11.0Psychomotor performance The sedative effects of ST zolpidem lozenges were assessed by multiple PD evaluations, including DSST, CRT, SCT, and Word Recall as well as by subjective self-rating of sedation by VAS. On the pre-drug performance sessions, no significant treatment differences were observed on any of these endpoints. During post-drug performance, in comparison to placebo, all measures were significantly affected by at least one dose of ST zolpidem. DSST scores at individual time points indicated significant psychomotor impairment by ST zolpidem 3.5 and 1.75 mg as early as 20 min post-intake (Figure 1). Significant reduction in DSST scores lasted up to 90 min post-dose (3.5 mg), and performance after ST zolpidem was no longer distinguishable from placebo on any endpoint as early as at the 3 h time point. These observations were confirmed by partial 1 h effect-area measures (Figure 2). There was significant impairment compared to placebo for ST zolpidem 1.75 mg and 3.5 mg during the (0–1) h time period, while there was no longer any difference during the (4–5) h time period. ST zolpidem 1 mg had no measurable effect by either analysis.Figure 1 Mean change over baseline in DSST scoresFigure 2 Mean±SEM 1 h effect areas for changes over baseline in DSST scores Relevant characteristics of the other PD evaluations are summarized in Table 3. Overall, it is readily apparent that ST zolpidem at the 1mg dose has no measurable effect on any parameter (except at one time point measuring the number of errors in CRT), whereas ST zolpidem 3.5 mg impacts all outcome measures, albeit for different time periods. Based on these tests, the time of maximum impairment by ST zolpidem 1.75 and 3.5 mg ranges from 20 min to 2 h post-dose, and time post-drug where the measured parameters no longer differed from placebo after 2 h.Table 3 Effect of ST zolpidem on daytime PD assessmentsParameterST zolpidem dosage (mg)Maximum change relative to placebop-valueTime of maximum changeTime no longer different from placeboWord Recall (# words)3.51.20.038720 min1 h1.751.0N.S.1 h, 2 hN.A.1.00.6N.S.1 hN.A.CRT (reaction time, ms)3.5234.7<0.000120 min2 h1.75103.3N.S.1 hN.A.1.085.7N.S.1 hN.A.CRT (# lapses)3.513.6<0.000120 min2.5 h1.755.60.019920 min1 h1.04.3N.S.1 hN.A.CRT (# errors)3.55.10.02253 h4 h1.753.1N.S.2.5 hN.A.1.06.80.04191 h1.5 hSCT3.514.8<0.000120 min2.0 h1.757.60.00111 h1.5 h1.03.0N.S.1 hN.A. Specifically, onset of impairment of CRT was found to be as early as the other PD outcomes, but duration was differentially affected depending on the specific parameter. Actual reaction time was significantly prolonged by zolpidem 3.5 mg at the early time points only and was no longer different from placebo at 2 h post-drug administration. The number of lapses was affected by both 3.5 and 1.75 mg ST zolpidem, with peak effect for both at 20 min, but duration of impairment was longer for the 3.5 mg than the 1.75 mg dose, 2.5 h, and 1.0 h, respectively. The number of errors committed during CRT measures was found to be somewhat variable. The 3.5 mg dose was associated with the longest duration of impairment with a peak effect at 3 h and subsequently, no statistical difference from placebo at 4 h. Although the 1.75 mg dose did not differ at any time point from placebo, there was one statistically significant increase in the number of errors after the 1mg dose, occurring at the 1 h time point (Table 3). The two higher doses of ST zolpidem, that is, 3.5 and 1.75 mg, significantly impaired fine motor activity as measured by SCT, with impairment due to the higher dose lasting 30 min longer than the lower, 1.5 h versus 1 h, respectively (Table 3). Lastly, in terms of memory, compared to placebo, immediate free recall was significantly impaired by ST zolpidem 3.5 mg at 20 min post-ingestion and this effect was no longer detectable 1 h later. No measurable effect was observed with the two lower doses of ST zolpidem (Table 3).Subjective ratings Self-ratings of sedation by the VAS exhibited a pattern similar to that observed for DSST (Figure 3). Subjects did not feel sedated at 10 min post-drug intake, but rated themselves significantly sedated compared to placebo from 20 min through 2 h post-drug at the 1.75 and 3.5 mg dose levels. The ratings remained different from placebo for up to 3 h, but were no longer statistically significantly different, primarily due to progressively increased sedation rating in the placebo condition.Figure 3 Mean change over baseline in scores of self-rated sedation on 100mm VASPK Descriptive statistics for the PK parameters are presented by dose in Table 4. Over the dose range and time periods studied, mean Cmax and mean AUC values were proportional to dose. Mean tmax and mean elimination half-life were equivalent across treatment conditions. Plasma concentration–time profiles following ST zolpidem administration are presented in Figure 4. Zolpidem plasma levels of >20–25 ng/ml were reached within 20 min after both 1.75 and 3.5 mg ST zolpidem administration and were maintained for up to 4 h. Zolpidem was no longer detectable 12 h after administration.Figure 4 Plasma concentration–time profiles of zolpidem following ST zolpidem administrationTable 4 Mean PK parameters (SD) of ST zolpidem1.0mg1.75mg3.5mgCmax (ng/ml)17.03 (6.84)32.17 (10.38)64.14 (22.36)Range Cmax0–35.519.33–60.3319.85–125.96t1/2 (h)2.33 (0.79)2.43 (0.60)2.45 (0.58)AUC0-inf (ng*h/ml)66.16 (31.49)126.10 (53.39)242.57 (100.37)tmax (min)35.7 (12.7)37.9 (16.1)37.9 (12.3)Safety The ST zolpidem lozenges were generally safe and well tolerated. Subjects experienced a total of 48 AEs, most of which were related to the clinical effect of the drug sedation and were mild-to-moderate in severity (Table 5). Side effects appeared only at the high dose, with 10 subjects reporting sedation at 3.5 mg compared to 3 subjects for placebo. Dizziness, nausea, and headache peaked at the 3.5 mg dose level (three, three and two subjects, respectively), with fewer instances seen with the 1.75 mg dose (one, zero, and two subjects) and no reports of these conditions at either the 1.0 mg level or placebo. Only one event (epigastric pain) was severe and was judged unrelated to treatment (1.75 mg lozenge) by the investigator. Two AEs not related to treatment (headache: 1.75 mg lozenge, dysmenorrhoea: placebo) were treated with Tylenol or ibuprofen. All other events resolved without treatment.Table 5 AEs occurring in ≥5% of subjectsVariablePlacebo1.0 mg1.75 mg3.5mgSomnolence3 (12.5%)5 (20.8%)3 (12.5%)10 (41.7%)Fatigue6 (25.0)2 (8.3)8 (33.3)4 (16.7)Dizziness——1 (4.2)3 (12.5)Nausea———3 (12.5)Headache——1 (4.2)2 (8.3)DISCUSSION Middle-of-the-night awakening with difficulty returning to sleep is a common complaint in chronic insomnia patients (Shochat et al., 1999). According to the National Sleep Foundation's 1995 ‘Sleep in America’ poll, about 20% of the US population may be suffering from MOTN insomnia and the prevalence in primary care patients may be even higher (Hohagen et al., 1994a, 1994b; Mellinger et al., 1985). Many patients with this kind of insomnia do not experience MOTN awakenings every night, but may dose themselves prophylactically with a hypnotic each evening prior to sleep, since presently all approved sedative hypnotics are indicated for pre-sleep use only. Ideally, however, MOTN sleep disruptions should be managed by MOTN dosing, only when the symptoms occur. A sedative-hypnotic with rapid onset and short duration would be ideal for such treatment. Low-dose, transmucosal zolpidem (ST zolpidem) is being developed to provide clinicians and patients with such an option for the management of MOTN insomnia. The present study evaluated, in healthy volunteers, the PD/PK of single doses of 1.0, 1.75, and 3.5 mg ST zolpidem following daytime administration. Specific PD outcome measures included DSST, Choice Reaction Time, SCT, Word Recall, and scoring on a self-rating 100mm VAS of sedation, all of which have been used extensively for the evaluation of the immediate performance-disruptive effects of sedativehypnotic drugs (Greenblatt et al., 1998) or their morning residual effects following their bedtime administration (Piergies et al., 1996; Scharf et al., 1994). It is noteworthy that this study was conducted in normal sleepers with zolpidem intake early in the morning subsequent to a full night's sleep. Although in this study, no direct comparison was included with zolpidem 5 or 10 mg in standard oral formulations, published observations of very similar study design indicate that following the 10 mg zolpidem dose, measurable performance deficit occurs at 1 h postintake and is of similar magnitude as measured here for the 3.5 mg dose (Greenblatt et al., 1998). Thus, it appears that sedative effects of ST zolpidem occurred at a lower dose and at a time less than half of those reported for oral zolpidem 10 mg (Ambien® 10 mg). Within the ST zolpidemdose range investigated in this study (1–3.5 mg), there was a reasonable dose–effect relationship with 3.5 mg showing the greatest sedative potential and 1.75 mg as the lowest active dose. The sublingual dose of 1mg can be considered a no-effect ST zolpidem dose. The PK profile of ST zolpidem lozenges is characterized by very rapid absorption with mean peak concentrations of 17.8 (range 0–35.5), 32.2 (range 9.3–60.3), and 64.1 (range 19.9–125.9) ng/ml for 1.0, 1.75, and 3.5 mg of ST zolpidem, respectively, occurring at approximately 37 (range 36–37.9) minutes post-administration. In comparison, currently available oral zolpidem tablets (Ambien®) are reported to attain peak concentrations (Cmax) of 59 (range 29–113) and 121 (range 58–272) ng/ml for 5 and 10 mg, respectively, at a mean time (tmax) of 1.6 h for both (Ambien® Package Insert). Thus, tmax for ST zolpidem occurs at a time less than half of that reported of the oral zolpidem tablets. In addition, within 20 min post-dose, ST zolpidem 1.75 and 3.5 mg achieved plasma zolpidem levels greater than 20 to 25 ng/ml, the estimated levels for onset and offset of sedation (Patat et al., 1994). These reportedly clinically relevant zolpidem blood levels are paralleled by the PD observations of sedative activity, specifically the effects on DSST scores and subjective ratings of sedation. ST zolpidem did not alter the elimination half-life of zolpidem: t1/2 of ST zolpidem (2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 h for 1, 1.75, and 3.5 mg, respectively) is very much in agreement with that reported for oral zolpidem tablets (2.5 and 2.6 h for 5 and 10 mg, respectively). ST zolpidem lozenges were found to be generally safe and well tolerated. The side effect profile was consistent with the low-dose sedative-hypnotic effects of zolpidem. Taken together, these results suggest that ST zolpidem 3.5 mg produced sedative activity similar to the sedative effects reported for 10 mg oral zolpidem. Furthermore, the maximal sedative effect as measured by DSST produced peak by ST zolpidem was observed as early as 20 min post-dose as compared to 60 min post-dose reported for 10 mg oral zolpidem (Greenblatt et al., 1998). These PD effects of ST zolpidem may be related to its PK as suggested by a shorter tmax for ST zolpidem than that reported for 10 mg oral zolpidem. Lastly, ST zolpidem produced rapid clinically relevant blood levels which persisted for 2–4 h which were paralleled with PD assays sedative activity. It may be concluded that these characteristics make ST zolpidem an ideal candidate for the prn treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia characterized by prolonged wakefulness after middle-of-the-night awakenings.

This study reports the pharmacokinetics of phenoxodiol in patients with cancer. The pharmacokinetics of phenoxodiol was studied following a single intravenous (iv) bolus dose and during a continuous intravenous infusion. Three men with prostate cancer and 3 women with breast cancer received IV bolus phenoxodiol (5 mg/kg) and plasma was sampled for free and total phenoxodiol levels. On a separate occasion 5 of the same patients received a continuous intravenous infusion of phenoxodiol (2 mg/kg/h) and plasma was again sampled for free and total phenoxodiol levels. Phenoxodiol was measured using gradient HPLC with ultraviolet detection. Following bolus injection, free and total phenoxodiol appeared to follow first order pharmacokinetics. The elimination half-lives for free and total phenoxodiol were 0.67 ± 0.53 h and 3.19 ± 1.93 h, respectively, while the total plasma clearance rates were 2.48 ± 2.33 L/h and 0.15 ± 0.08 L/h, respectively. The respective apparent volumes of distribution were 1.55 ± 0.69 L/kg and 0.64 ± 0.51 L/kg. During continuous intravenous infusion, free phenoxodiol accumulated rapidly to reach a mean concentration at steady state of 0.79 ± 0.14 μg/ml after 0.87 ± 0.18 h. The apparent accumulation half-life of free phenoxodiol was 0.17 ± 0.04 h while the plasma clearance during continuous infusion was 1.29 ± 0.23 L/h. Phenoxodiol has a short plasma half-life, particularly in the free form, leading to a rapid attainment of steady state levels during continuous intravenous infusion.

Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): Background Phenoxodiol (PXD, NV-06) is an isoflavone derivative that has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to possess anti-cancer activity [1-9]. Phenoxodiol is a synthetic analogue of genistein with unknown mechanism of action. It appears to have pleiotropic actions such as inhibition of tyrosine kinases, inhibition of topoisomerase II in a dose-dependent manner and inhibition of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis [2,10-12] but the predominant mode of action remains to be elucidated. A series of intriguing observations were made by Morre et al. [13-16], who showed that phenoxodiol acts by inhibiting ENOX2 (tNOX), a tumour-associated cell surface ubiquitinol (NADH) oxidase, which functions as an alternative pathway for plasma membrane electron transport. Further, phenoxodiol has the ability to modulate chemoresistance and promote apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells [2,17,18]. These anti-cancer properties have generated much interest in phenoxodiol as a potential cancer treatment. Phase I studies of phenoxodiol have been previously published [19,20], and the molecule was being studied in a Phase III clinical trial in the treatment of ovarian cancer until recently, when the study was halted prior to full accrual. At the time this study was performed in 2000, we had no information regarding the behaviour of phenoxodiol in humans, so the first study undertaken was a pharmacokinetic study to investigate both bolus and continuous intravenous administration. This paper presents data derived from that first-in-human, pharmacokinetic study, and our aim at the time was to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of phenoxodiol in order to inform us further about the design of Phase I and other studies.Methods A single centre, open-label pharmacokinetic study involving six patients with metastatic cancer was performed between April 2000 and November 2000. Each patient was recruited in a serial manner and given a single intravenous (iv) injection of phenoxodiol over a five minute period at a dose of 5 mg/kg initially. At least 6 weeks after their individual intravenous bolus administration, each patient was then given a continuous infusion of phenoxodiol at a rate of 2 mg/kg per hour for a duration of up to ten times the average half life determined from the data obtained after intravenous bolus dosing. No continuous intravenous infusion occurred until all the pharmacokinetic data from intravenous bolus dosing was available. The intravenous bolus dose of phenoxodiol was selected as 10% of bolus intravenous doses achievable in mice up to 50 mg/kg that had demonstrated no discernible toxicity, including histopathological evaluation (data on file, Novogen Pty Ltd).Subjects Six patients were studied in total. The inclusion criteria were: male or female volunteers with metastatic disease from any solid tumour, age 18 to 70 years, normal haematological parameters, and a prognosis of at least three months. Exclusion criteria were: leukemia or lymphoma, allergy to soy products, vegetarian diet or use of soy product more than three times a week, the use of sex steroids in the previous two months, antibiotic therapy within one month prior to the study period or at any time during the study, smoking of greater than 10 cigarettes/day, and the known presence of central nervous system metastases. Active infection or other co-morbid disease that in the opinion of the investigator would have precluded the patient from participating in the study was also an exclusion criterion. Patients also had to have relatively stable or slow growing tumours and not commence new anti-cancer therapies while on study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of St George Hospital (00/13 Howes), and patients had written, fully informed consent.Study protocol Screening procedures included a medical history, full physical examination, haematology and biochemistry. Volunteers were then assessed for compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients were instructed to maintain a diet low in isoflavones for one week prior to and for the duration of the study, and to arrive at the hospital on the treatment day at approximately 0800 having fasted and abstained from caffeine and alcohol for 24 hours (h). An initial blood sample of 40 ml was drawn from an antecubital vein-indwelling catheter at baseline prior to study medication administration. Blood draws were planned at 0.0 (baseline, prior to infusion), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 10.0 and 12.0 h after the administration of phenoxodiol. A standard, light, low fat meal was provided 4 hours after the administration of study medication. After observation for 12 hours, the indwelling intravenous catheter was removed and the patient advised not to consume alcohol over the ensuing 24-hour period. At least 6 weeks after their intravenous bolus dose, patients were recalled individually for their continuous intravenous infusion. The same diet and preparation was required prior to dosing. Fifteen ml of blood was collected at baseline and at 10 and 20 minutes following the start of infusion of phenoxodiol, then at 20 minute intervals up to five hours after the commencement of the infusion. A standard, light, low fat meal was provided 4 hours after the administration of study medication. Both indwelling venous catheters were removed six hours after commencement of the infusion and the patient was then allowed to leave the hospital following a period of observation.Safety assessmentsLaboratory Safety Testing The following tests were performed at baseline, 24 h, and 48 h after intravenous bolus dosing, and at baseline, 6 h, 5 7 days and 12 14 days after the start of continuous intravenous infusion: full blood count (FBC) including hemoglobin, red cell count, white cell count and differential, platelets, as well as serum biochemistry including total protein, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) and urea and electrolytes.Vital Signs and Other Safety Measurements The patient's weight, height and blood pressure and heart rate were measured at baseline; blood pressure and heart rate were monitored throughout the study.Study medication administration Phenoxodiol was manufactured by Novogen Laboratories, 140 Wicks Road, North Ryde NSW 2119, Australia, and was prepared as an intravenous injection of 100 mg in a 10 ml vial. Samples of the batches of vials used were tested for sterility and for the presence of pyrogens. For single bolus intravenous injection, phenoxodiol was diluted to a total volume of 50 ml in normal saline. The solution was infused over a five minute period using an infusion pump. For continuous intravenous infusion, phenoxodiol was diluted to 500 ml in normal saline and infused using a pump at a constant rate of 100 ml per hour.Assay of phenoxodiol levels Total phenoxodiol levels were measured in a 300 μL aliquot of plasma or urine which was mixed with 15 μL glucuronidase and incubated for 24 h at 24°C prior to extraction. Free phenoxodiol levels were measured in a 300 μL aliquot of plasma or urine which was extracted without prior incubation with glucuronidase. After adding 10 μL of 2, 4, 4'- trihydroxydeoxy-benzoin (0.22 mg/mL) as an internal standard, the sample was extracted using an ethylacetate : hexane (6:4) solution 500 μL. The sample-solvent mixture was centrifuged at 1200 g for 15 min and supernatant was collected and dried under vacuum. The extract was reconstituted in 100 μL 50% isopropanol in water. 5 uL of the extracted sample was injected into the HPLC system. Standards of phenoxodiol were prepared in blank plasma or urine. HPLC separation was carried out using an Alltech Alltima C18, 5 μm, 250 mm × 2.1 mm column in a 40°C oven. The gradient elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min from mobile phase A (25% acetonitrile, 74.95% water, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) to mobile phase B (99.95% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). The fraction of mobile phase A to mobile phase B at 0, 4.5, 9, 11, 12 and 14 minutes were 75:25, 40:60, 30:70, 0:100, 0:100 and 75:25 respectively. With 6 minutes post run, the total run time was 20 minutes. Phenoxodiol and the internal standard (benzoin) were detected by ultraviolet diode array detector at wavelength 335 nm. The approximate retention time for benzoin and phenoxodiol were 6.7 minutes and 8.4 minutes, respectively. The calibration curve for the assay was linear in the range of 0.25 ug/mL to 10 ug/mL with a correlation coefficient (R2)>0.994. The lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) for phenoxodiol was 0.25 ug/mL. Samples with high concentrations were diluted with the same blank matrix before being analysed. As phenoxodiol has very good absorption at 335 nm and blank biological matrix has much less UV absorption at this wavelength, co-elution did not cause any problems with regards to interpretation. Some samples were analysed using both HPLC-UV and LC-MS-MS methods and the results were similar, thus validating our study data.Pharmacokinetic analysis The concentration at steady state (Css) and the time to reach steady state were taken as the actual values when the measured plasma phenoxodiol concentration appeared to reach a maximum. The terminal elimination rate constant (Kel) was estimated using linear regression analysis using the final plasma sampling times over which the log of the plasma concentration versus time curve appeared to be straight. At least four plasma concentration time points were used for each estimation. The elimination half life (T1/2) was calculated as 0.693/Kel. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoid rule with the terminal phase (last measured plasma concentration time point to infinity) calculated as the final plasma concentration divided by Kel. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) following acute administration in Part 1 of the study was calculated by extrapolating the log plasma concentration versus time line back to zero time to estimate the theoretical plasma concentration at zero time (C0) and dividing C0 by the dose. Clearance following acute administration was calculated as Vd multiplied by Kel. Accumulation half-lives during continuous intravenous infusions of phenoxodiol were calculated as the time to achieve steady state plasma concentrations divided by 5. Clearance (Cl) was calculated as the infusion rate of phenoxodiol divided by the plasma concentration at steady state (Css). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with the assistance of the Excel software plug-in program pkf (Joel I. Usansky, Ph.D., Atul Desai, M.S. and Diane Tang-Liu, Ph.D., Department of Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism, Allergan, Irvine, CA 92606, U.S.A). The results are expressed as the mean values for the subject group along with standard deviations (SD) and ranges.ResultsPatients Six patients (3 males, 3 females) were given intravenous bolus doses of phenoxodiol, but only five went on to receive continuous intravenous infusion. The patient who missed out on continuous intravenous infusion had developed progression of her disease and was advised by her oncologist to proceed with other treatments; there was no evidence that the single administration of phenoxodiol had contributed to her disease progression. Continuous intravenous infusion occurred an average of 56 ± 21 days (range 41-98 days) following intravenous bolus dosing of phenoxodiol. The mean age of the patients was 61.2 ± 9.4 years, their mean weight was 75.3 ± 8.48 kg and their mean height was 169.2 ± 10.0 cm. One patient smoked (5 cigarettes per day), 3 patients consumed between 10 and 30 g of alcohol per day and 3 patients did not regularly consume alcohol. The 3 female patients had metastatic breast cancer and had a diagnosis of the primary malignancy 15, 7 and one year prior to the study. The 3 males had metastatic prostate cancer and two of these patients had a diagnosis of the primary malignancy 6 years prior to the study. The date of diagnosis of the primary malignancy for the remaining male was unknown. Patients predominately had bone metastases, although one male had known hepatic metastases. One male patient also had a history of laryngectomy for malignant disease. One patient had bilateral leg oedema and hepatic enlargement on physical examination. Clinical examination findings in the remaining patients were unremarkable. One patient had mild thrombocytopenia at baseline, but haematology parameters were otherwise within normal limits for the remaining patients. Three patients had abnormal liver function tests at baseline; two had serum ALKP levels 3-5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), one had GGT levels 9 × ULN, and one had a GGT level 1-2 × ULN. All six patients had normal renal function and normal serum electrolyte levels.Pharmacokinetics Summaries of the pharmacokinetic data for free and total phenoxodiol following the single intravenous bolus dose are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Plasma concentration versus time plots for free and total phenoxodiol for these patients are presented in Figures 1 and 2. Linear regression of log plasma concentration versus time plots indicate that phenoxodiol appeared to follow first order kinetics in all patients (that is, a single phase of elimination from plasma). This was the case for both free and total phenoxodiol. Total phenoxodiol had a longer plasma elimination half-life than free phenoxodiol, but both were relatively short (mean values 3.19 ± 1.93 h and 0.67 ± 0.53 h, respectively). These short half-lives were associated with relatively high mean total plasma clearance rates of 2.48 ± 2.33 L/h and 0.15 ± 0.08 L/h respectively. The apparent volumes of distribution (Vd) at steady state for free and total phenoxodiol were relatively low (1.55 ± 0.69 L/kg and 0.64 ± 0.51 L/kg, for free and total phenoxodiol, respectively) and total phenoxodiol had a lower volume of distribution than free phenoxodiol. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curves for (AUC) total phenoxodiol following the bolus intravenous dose in Part 1 of the study was approximately 15 times greater than for free phenoxodiol.Table 1 Pharmacokinetic parameters for free phenoxodiol following a single bolus dose of 5 mg/kg infused intravenously over 5 minutes.PatientKelT1/2 (h)AUC0-t (μg.h/ml)AUC0-inf (μg.h/ml)Cl (L/h)Vd (L/kg)11.250.551.491.55 (4.1%)*1.501.2022.420.280.400.40 (1.2%)7.012.9031.590.431.041.05 (13.2%)2.221.4041.240.561.651.66 (10.3)1.241.0050.391.742.592.59 (11.3)0.461.1761.540.451.211.22 (11.8%)2.461.60Mean ± SD1.41 ± 0.660.67 ± 0.531.40 ± 0.731.41 ± 0.73 (8.7%)2.48 ± 2.331.55 ± 0.69 Kel is the elimination rate constant.

Summaries of the pharmacokinetic data for free and total phenoxodiol from the 5 patients who had continuous intravenous dosing are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Plasma concentration versus time plots for free and total phenoxodiol for these patients are presented in Figures 3 and 4. Plasma levels of free phenoxodiol accumulated fairly rapidly with a mean accumulation half-life of 0.17 ± 0.04 hours. Plasma levels of total phenoxodiol accumulated at a relatively slower rate with a mean accumulation half life of 2.78 ± 0.96 hours. Steady state plasma levels of total phenoxodiol were more variable than steady state plasma levels of free phenoxodiol (Figures 3 and 4). The mean clearance rate for total phenoxodiol (0.06 ± 0.01 L/h) was lower than that of free phenoxodiol (1.29 ± 0.23 L/h). In two of the patients (patient 1 and patient 2) the infusion did not appear to be continued long enough for total phenoxodiol to reach steady state plasma levels. As a result, though the final plasma concentration time point in these patients was used to estimate Css, accumulation half-life and clearance, the calculated values are likely to be underestimated.Table 3 Pharmacokinetic parameters for free phenoxodiol infused at a dose of 2 mg/kg/h.Css (μg/ml)Time to ss (h)Acc T1/2 (h)Cl (L/h)10.920.670.131.0820.651.000.201.5340.771.000.201.2850.661.000.201.5160.960.670.131.03Mean ± SD0.79 ± 0.140.87 ± 0.180.17 ± 0.041.29 ± 0.23 Css is the plasma concentration at steady state.

Urine excretion of free and total phenoxodiol, respectively, ranged from 0.5 mg - 5.2 mg and 13 - 42 mg after intravenous bolus dosing (data not shown). Urine excretion of phenoxodiol after continuous intravenous infusion was not measured.Conjugation The degree of phenoxodiol conjugation is estimated at 91%, based on calculation of the proportion of free phenoxodiol AUC : total phenoxodiol AUC (mean 8.7%) from bolus administration. For each individual subject, estimated proportion of free phenoxodiol from the bolus data correlates very well with total phenoxodiol clearance as measured during continuous infusion (data not shown).Adverse events In total, five adverse events were reported from 2 patients; no other patients had adverse events. One patient experienced 3 serious adverse events: hepatic metastasis, leg oedema and thrombocytopenia; all of these had been present prior to the study but had increased in severity during the study. They were considered to be due to disease progression and unrelated to the study medication. This patient died 7 days after continuous intravenous infusion of phenoxodiol. His death was considered to be due to rapid progression of malignant disease and unrelated to the study medication. The second patient experienced two non-serious adverse events: groin pain and nausea. The groin pain occurred the day following the single bolus dose of phenoxodiol and was considered not to be related to the study medication. The episode of nausea occurred following the continuous intravenous infusion of phenoxodiol, was mild in intensity, and was considered to be possibly related to study medication. The episode of nausea did not require intervention and resolved spontaneously.Discussion This first - in - human study investigated the pharmacokinetics of phenoxodiol, a novel isoflavone, given as a single intravenous bolus injection and as a single episode of continuous intravenous infusion in the same patients. We showed that mean plasma levels of free phenoxodiol declined rapidly from an initial value of around 3 μg/ml with an apparent half-life of 0.67 h. The clearance of free phenoxodiol was relatively high (2.48 L/h) and the volume of distribution was 1.55 L/kg, indicating distribution of the drug into a body compartment approximately 2.3 times the extracellular fluid volume. Plasma levels of total phenoxodiol declined from an initial value of approximately 8 μg/ml with an apparent half-life of 3.19 h. Similar to free phenoxodiol, the log-plasma concentration plot for each patient appeared linear (data not presented) suggesting first order pharmacokinetics. The clearance of total phenoxodiol (0.15 L/h) was considerably lower than for free phenoxodiol. In contrast, the volume of distribution of total phenoxodiol (0.64 L/kg) was smaller than for free phenoxodiol. Plasma concentrations of total phenoxodiol were more variable than for free phenoxodiol. The ratio of AUC free phenoxodiol : AUC total phenoxodiol was 0.087, indicating that >90% of the drug following an intravenous bolus was present in the conjugated form. Furthermore, the initial plasma concentrations of total phenoxodiol were approximately 2.7 times the initial plasma concentrations of free phenoxodiol. These observations are most likely due to rapid conjugation of phenoxodiol in the liver and a slower clearance of conjugated than free phenoxodiol. Urine excretion of phenoxodiol was difficult to interpret because of missing data points from incomplete urine collections. Nevertheless, it appears that 8 hours was not sufficiently long for the complete collection of all phenoxodiol excreted by renal mechanisms. Following continuous intravenous infusion, plasma concentrations of free plasma phenoxodiol rose rapidly with an apparent accumulation half-life of 0.17 h. Although this appeared to be a little shorter than the half-life estimated following the single intravenous bolus dose in Part 1 of the study, the results were also more variable in Part 1 of the study. The plasma clearance calculated during the continuous infusion (1.29 L/h) appeared a little lower than following intravenous bolus dosing, but the results were consistent with each other. Further, the degree of individual phenoxodiol conjugation estimated from the bolus part of the study correlated well with clearance measured in the continuous infusion part of the study. The mean plasma concentrations of free phenoxodiol at steady state were approximately 0.79 μg/ml, which is broadly in the range that has been demonstrated to have anti-cancer effects in in vitro studies. Since this study was performed however, two publications regarding phenoxodiol pharmacokinetics have appeared in print [19,20]. In a 7 day infusion study of phenoxodiol, steady state levels were reached in 14 of 19 patients [20]. Phenoxodiol doses were escalated in patient cohorts, ranging from 0.65 mg/kg/24 h to 27 mg/kg/24 h. Overall mean accumulation half-life of conjugated phenoxodiol was 10.63 h, and time to Css was 53.14 h with a clearance rate of 0.0260 L/Kg/h [20]. At the closest dose cohort to the present study (2.2 mg/kg/24 h), mean Css was 4.8 μg/ml. In a study of weekly intravenous bolus phenoxodiol [19], clearance of total phenoxodiol was found to be higher (around 82 ml/min) and half-life longer (around 300 mins) than in this study. Interestingly, clearance of phenoxodiol was similar in these two studies to our present study, but half-life was significantly longer. It is important to note that comparison across studies is problematic, since one study reported parameters concerning conjugated phenoxodiol only [20], whereas this study and the weekly bolus study measured free and total phenoxodiol. Further, the significance of conjugation is unclear, though we hypothesize that free phenoxodiol is the most biologically active, and therefore the most important moiety. Other reasons for the discrepancy between pharmacokinetic parameters in the different studies include different methods for assay (HPLC in this study, LC-MS in the other two), and the use of a different (cyclodextrin) carrier for phenoxodiol in the Phase I studies. Other than the different preparation, other possible explanations include the tight control of diet, caffeine and smoking in this study, whereas conditions were not stated in the Phase I studies. The limitations of our study are that only a small number of patients with cancer were studied due to the fact that it was a first -in-human Phase 1 study of Phenoxodiol. In addition, we examined only a limited dose range of phenoxodiol, so we cannot comment on whether the pharmacokinetics of phenoxodiol are truly linear on the basis of this study. Furthermore, the effects of age and of renal or hepatic dysfunction on phenoxodiol pharmacokinetics are not known. Further studies are required to address these issues.Conclusions In conclusion, the results of our study indicate that phenoxodiol has a very short half-life when given intravenously, particularly for the free form. Since pharmacokinetic variance within (our study) and between individuals [19,20] is very wide, it would appear that administration of phenoxodiol by continuous infusion or by chronic oral administration may be the optimal modes of administration if it considered that constant plasma levels are desirable for anti-cancer therapy.Competing interests Funded by Novogen Pty Ltd, Sydney Australia.

Usually, the studies involving gene modifications in the course of the evolution are concerned to nucleotide sequence alterations in closely related species. However, the analysis of large scale data about the distribution of gene families in non-exclusively closely related species can provide insights on how plastic or how conserved a given gene family is. Here, we analyze the abundance and diversity of all Eukaryotic Clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOG) present in STRING database, resulting in a total of 4,850 KOGs. This dataset comprises 481,421 proteins distributed among 55 eukaryotes. We propose an index to evaluate the evolutionary plasticity and conservation of an orthologous group based on its abundance and diversity across eukaryotes. To further KOG plasticity analysis, we estimate the evolutionary distance average among all proteins which take part in the same orthologous group. As a result, we found a strong correlation between the evolutionary distance average and the proposed evolutionary plasticity index. Additionally, we found low evolutionary plasticity in genes associated with inviability and genes associated with early lethality. At last, we plot the evolutionary plasticity value in different gene networks from yeast and humans. As a result, it was possible to discriminate among higher and lower plastic areas of the gene networks analyzed. The distribution of gene families brings valuable information on evolutionary plasticity which might be related with genetic plasticity. Accordingly, it is possible to discriminate among conserved and plastic orthologous groups by evaluating their abundance and diversity across eukaryotes.

Background Biological systems are constantly changing at different hierarchical levels, such as genome sequences, gene/protein networks and organismal phenotypes. However, evolutionary constraints selectively act on all levels of organization allowing some changes and constraining others. Regarding specifically genomes, constraints do not act equally among all genetic sequences. Different classes of organisms (e.g. prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and multicellular eukaryotes) as well as different genomes structures (e.g. codifying sequences, introns, and "junk" sequences) can present huge differences in constraints. Even among codifying sequences, constraints act differently depending on the effect a possible mutation will generate on gene product. Synonymous mutations, for instance, are less constrained comparing to non-synonymous mutations. In addition, mutations in gene regions responsible for crucial sites, such as folding sites or enzymatic active sites, can be more constrained than disordered segments of proteins [1]. Considering genes as units, there are variable degrees of constraints leading to different evolutionary rates acting on different genes. Evolutionary rate of genes has been extensively studied, being related to several factors - not necessarily concurrent - such as gene expression level [2], gene essentiality [3], gene duplication [4], connectivity of the gene products [5], and gene age [6,7]. It is possible to describe the cellular metabolism by a graph or network, where gene or gene products are represented by nodes and their associations, by links. From the point of view of gene networks, genetic modifications might affect both links (interactions among gene products) and nodes (gene products). Modifications on genes structure, such as single mutation, deletions, or insertions can modify the interactions between the mutated gene product and its network partners (e.g. proteins participating in the same pathway), altering links of their network. Events as gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer modify the gene network by inserting nodes. In addition, network nodes can be deleted by gene loss events [8]. Similarly to genes, different gene networks might be subject to different constraints being more or less tolerant to changes and likewise presenting different levels of genetic plasticity - the ability of a functional gene or gene network to tolerate alterations in its components or structure [9]. Plasticity is an elusive property, in the sense it cannot be directly measured and it is always required a subjacent model to design a proper measure. Different artificial model networks have been proposed to define plasticity measures, bringing interesting conclusions on the possible functioning of biological networks [10,11]. In addition, in silico techniques have shown good power of prediction for metabolic networks in unicellular organisms [12,13]. In complex multicellular organisms, however, there is paucity of data. In effect, determining the plasticity of a given gene network is far from a straightforward task also due to the incomplete knowledge about the relationships among gene-products as well as about their behavior in different environmental conditions [14]. Regarding genes, a possible manner to experimentally investigate genetic plasticity is by using deletion analysis and different projects have developed and organized gene deletion information for different model organisms [15,16]. In this case, robustness against gene deletion may be interpreted as a tolerance against alterations on the network (node deletion), implying a correlation with plasticity. Deletion information is relatively well established for unicellular organisms such as yeast; for mammals, however, it involves more complicated and expensive techniques and the information is somewhat incomplete, even for model organisms. A relevant problem one faces when defining a plasticity measure has to do with time scales. Here we consider time scales long enough to allow for speciation. For these time scales there is consensus that, for example, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system is highly conserved: both the set of genes and the biochemical reactions they participate in are fairly similar in every extant eukaryote on Earth. Although this set of genes appeared very early in evolution, they have not been often deleted in descendent species and they have not suffered many duplications. Accordingly, each DNA repair genes has an ortholog in almost all species, without many paralogs [9]. Following this reasoning, we can infer that conserved, non-plastic genes belong to families spread over all eukaryotes with few paralogs. On the other hand, one could expect that ancient, plastic genes would have suffered deletions, and duplications in some species, but not in others, throughout evolutionary times. The consequence for their ortholog groups would be i) not having orthologs in many species, and ii) when a given species has a gene in those groups, they will also present many paralogous genes. The crescent sea of data generated by genome sequencing projects has provided raw material to investigate the evolutionary relationships among genes from different species. The analysis of large scale data about the distribution of gene families (i.e. genes possessing the same common ancestor gene - an orthologous group [17]) across non-exclusively closely related species can provide insights about how plastic or how conserved a given orthologous group has been throughout its evolutionary history. In some extent, this evolutionary plasticity of an orthologous group might bring a perspective on the genetic plasticity of their orthologous genes. The idea is to estimate for each group of orthologs in eukaryotes the number of genes and how they are distributed among the species. From this information, properly processed, one can characterize their evolutionary history. For this measure to yield information, it must discriminate different orthologous groups. As shown in what follows, this is possible, since a considerable number of gene families has components spread in virtually all eukaryotes, whereas a great number of orthologous groups is restricted to some specific lineages [6]. Accordingly, the distribution analysis of a gene family in a species group brings valuable information about how conserved and how old that gene family is [7]. A common way to evaluate the breadth and the depth of a gene family distribution is based in looking for gene presence and absence in an evolutionary tree [18-20]. An alternative way to evaluate the distribution of an orthologous group consists in using the Shannon information theory [21] to determine the diversity (Hα) of its distribution in a species group [9]. This methodology is able to discriminate orthologous groups presenting patchy phylogenetic distributions - including lineage specific gene families - from broad distributed orthologous groups. Molecular mechanisms such as gene duplication, exon shuffling, transposable elements, gene fusion and fission, and horizontal gene transfer have been related to development of new genes [22]. Among them, gene duplication has been discussed to be one of the most important events in genome evolution by providing the prime source of genetic material in which evolutionary forces can act generating novelty [23,24]. Duplication events occur randomly and duplicated genes can address different fates: (i) they can be selectively preserved, mainly by bringing an adaptive advantage; (ii) they can be selectively eliminated by bringing an adaptive disadvantage; and (iii) they can remain unoccupied, drifting in evolutionary process, eventually being eliminated or, more rarely, evolving to develop another biological function [25]. It is noticeable some orthologous groups possess one-to-one relationships, while there are gene families composed by a great number of paralogs [26]. The reason why some duplicated genes are fixed while others are eliminated has been extensively discussed; however, the mechanisms driving the destiny of the new-born duplicated genes remain controversial [25,27-29]. The Neo-Functionalization (NEO-F) and the Escape from Adaptive Conflict (EAC) are among of the most important theories about the fixation of duplicated genes. NEO-F represents the first idea of evolution by gene duplication and suggests that once duplicated, one of the gene copies turns free to acquire a new function in the course of the accumulation of neutral mutations, while another copy preserves the original biological function. EAC suggests that a pleiotropic gene performing more than one function - where each function could not be independently improved - will be beneficed by a duplication event where each gene copy is then free to specialize in each different function former performed by a single gene. A third theory is represented by sub-functionalization, where degenerating mutations happens in both duplicated copies that subdivides gene function between the duplicated genes. Consequently, both altered copies are preserved by selection since any individual former gene is able to entirely perform their biological function (for review, see [29]). A useful method to identify the importance of duplication events in the evolutionary history of an orthologous group is given by the ratio between the number of components present in the orthologous group and the number of organisms containing items from this orthologous group. In a previous paper, we analyzed the distribution and the duplicability of a set of 142 orthologous groups extracted from STRING database http://string.embl.de/ to investigate the evolutionary origin of human apoptosis and genome stability gene network [9]. Here, we extended the analysis to all Eukaryotic Clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOG) available in STRING. Our goal here is to evaluate the evolutionary plasticity and conservation of an orthologous group according to the distribution of their components (i.e. orthologous and paralogous proteins). For each KOG present in STRING database, we calculate the diversity and abundance of their components across 55 fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes and suggest an equation to determine the evolutionary plasticity taking into account both diversity and abundance. To further KOG plasticity analysis, we estimate the evolutionary distance average among all proteins which take part in the same orthologous group from a sample of the KOGs present in STRING database. As a result, we found a strong correlation between the evolutionary distance average and the evolutionary plasticity index proposed. Additionally, we evaluate the evolutionary plasticity of mouse and yeast genes associated with lethality when knocked-out. We found low evolutionary plasticity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes associated with inviability and Mus musculus genes associated with early lethality. At the end, we plot the evolutionary plasticity value in different gene networks from yeast and human to identify their more and less evolutionary plastic areas as well as their more and less evolutionary conserved areas.ResultsGenes distribution within Orthologous Groups To assess the distribution of genes within each KOG we evaluated their diversity (Hα) and abundance (Dα) as described in Methods section. Hα provides the distribution of a given orthologous group across a species group. High diversity indicates an equalized distribution of KOG components (i.e. orthologous and paralogous proteins) among the species evaluated. On the contrary, low diversity suggests a non-homogenous distribution. For a KOG to present maximal diversity their components are present in all species, meaning that this KOG ancestral gene arrived early in evolution, in the last common ancestor of all considered organisms - in our case, in the origin of eukaryotes or before. Furthermore, besides this ancestral appearing early in evolution, for its descendants to be found in all assessed genomes, deletion episodes cannot have happened very often. Dα is defined as the average of number of proteins belonging to the same KOG, present in each organism. In general, high abundance denotes many duplication episodes in the evolutionary history of an orthologous group. Figure 1 shows the distribution according to Hα and Dα of all KOGs (4850 KOGs in total) present in STRING.Figure 1 Diversity (Hα) and abundance (Dα) distribution. Each KOG present in STRING database was plot according to Hα(y axis) and Dα(x axis) values. Note that there is a range of distribution, where Hα of the majority of the KOGs is around 0.8 to 1, while Dα is concentrated from 1 to 10. However, there are KOGs that show Hα values lower than 0.8 as well as KOGs that present Dα values higher than 10.Evolutionary Plasticity Index Low values of Dα combined with high values for Hα indicates low plastic orthologous group, since it is present in many species, with few components, indicating it suffered few modifications (i.e. few duplication and deletion episodes) during eukaryotic evolution. Based on this, we have defined the evolutionary plastic index, EPI, to define how plastic a given orthologous group is, as follows:(1) Note that 0≤ Hα≤1 and Dα≥1. As a result, 0≤ EPI ≤1. Figure 2A shows the distribution of all KOGs present in STRING organized in 100 groups according to EPI. Once identified the EPI of a given orthologous group, this information can be transferred to the proteins that compose this orthologous group (Figure 2B). The distribution of KOGs has its maximum displaced to low plasticity (Figure 2A); however, the distribution of proteins is roughly uniform (Figure 2B). This means that those KOGS with low plasticity present a lower number of proteins, strongly indicating a negative correlation between EPI and number of components (for further discussions, see Additional file 1, section 1.2).Figure 2 Evolutionary Plasticity Index (EPI) distribution. All KOGs present in STRING database were grouped in 100 categories according to EPI (A). All proteins present in KOG dataset were grouped in 100 categories according EPI (B).Evolutionary Distance versus EPI Genes can differ in their evolutionary rates. Genes under purifying selection evolve slower compared to genes under Darwinian selection [30]. In this sense, analyzing the amino acid differences among gene products from the same orthologous group might give us an alternative plasticity evaluation of a gene family. We compared the amino acid sequences, all against all, for a sample of KOGs present in STRING using Poisson correction method [31,32] as described in Methods section. This method analyzes the differences in amino acid sequences and provides an evolutionary distance between two proteins. We used the average of all distances among proteins of the same KOG to take the evolutionary distance average of each KOG evaluated. Note that we did not evaluate synonymous substitution since the analysis was performed utilizing amino acid sequences. Therefore, every observed difference corresponds to non-synonymous substitutions. Figure 3A shows a strong correlation (Pearson correction 0.68621, two-tailed test p < 0.0001) between EPI and evolutionary distance of the evaluated KOGs. KOGs that possess high EPI present high evolutionary distance among their gene products as well as KOGs identified as having low EPI possess proteins more similar to each other. According to Figure 3A, the components of a KOG presenting low EPI are more similar among each other, comparing to components of a KOG presenting high EPI. No correlation was identified when plotting evolutionary distance versus Dα (Figure 2B), Hα (Figure 2C), number of species, and number of proteins (see Additional file 1, Supplementary Figure S6).Figure 3 Evolutionary distance average versus EPI. 5% of the KOGs present in STRING database were sorted. The evolutionary distance among all proteins of each KOG evaluated was calculated and the evolutionary distance average (Poisson Distance) was obtained. Poisson Distance was plotted against EPI (A), abundance (B) and diversity (C) of each KOG evaluated. Red line indicates the linear regression fitting curve and the box shows the curve proprieties.Functional Plasticity Analysis To verify correlation of EPI with previous estimates of genetic plasticity, we assessed knock-out data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Mus musculus, and looked for genes related with lethality. We considered two criteria to identify genes involved with lethality: (i) S. cerevisiae genes which confer inviability when knocked-out and (ii) M. musculus target genes which cause early lethality (i.e. lethality before placentation). Additionally, we considered as viable S. cerevisiae genes annotated as "viable" in SGD as well as M. musculus genes annotated as "no abnormal phenotype detected" without any phenotype annotation associated with lethality in MGI (to further discussion, please see Supplementary material, section 1.3). Figure 4 shows the distribution of proteins from S. cerevisiae (Figure 4A) and M. musculus (Figure 4B) according to EPI. The grey landscape represents the EPI distribution of all proteins of S. cerevisiae (Figure 4A) and M. musculus (Figure 4B) present in KOG dataset. Yeast proteins present a distribution concentrated in low EPI, while mouse proteins present a more uniform EPI distribution (to further discussion, please see Supplementary material, section 1.4). The EPI distribution of proteins codified by genes involved with lethality when knocked-out have their maxima displaced to low EPI in both yeast and mouse (blue lines in Figures 4A and 4B, respectively). The opposite can be observed when considering proteins codified by genes associated to viable phenotype when knocked-out (red lines in Figures 4A and 4B). Figure 4C shows that mean EPI of inviable group is significantly lower comparing to mean EPI from all S. cerevisiae proteins present in KOG dataset. In the same way, the early lethality group has mean EPI significantly lower as compared to the totality of M. musculus proteins found in KOG dataset (Figure 4D). Additionally, mean EPI of viable groups are significantly higher when compared to respective total groups in both S. cerevisiae and M. musculus (Figure 4C and 4D, respectively).Figure 4 EPI distribution of target genes related with lethality when knocked-out. The percentage of S. cerevisiae (A) and M. musculus (B) genes presenting different EPI values is show. The grey landscape represents the EPI distribution of all genes from each species. Blue lines represent the EPI distribution of S. cerevisiae genes associated with inviable phenotype when knocked-out (A) and M. musculus target genes associated with early lethality (B). Red lines represent the EPI distribution of target genes associated with viable phenotypes (A and B). Boxes represent EPI distribution of the different gene categories (total, inviable, and viable) from S. cerevisiae (C) and (total, early lethality, and viable) from M. musculus (D). The edges of the boxes indicate the upper and lower quartiles. The line at the center of each box indicates the median, and the whiskers represent the standard deviation. * indicates different from total group (p < 0.0001).Evolutionary Plasticity Index of biological networks Cell functions are performed by functional modules [10,33] and gene network co-evolution has been proposed as an important evolutionary driving force agent [34]. In the same way, a network composed by proteins that take part in ancient and conserved KOGs can be regarded as conserved. To analyze the evolutionary plasticity of functional biological networks, we constructed the network of different pathways present in KEGG database http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ using protein interaction information from STRING (to further information, see Methods section). After network construction, we plotted the plasticity information of the network components (i.e. the EPI of the orthologous group of each gene from the network) onto network topology. Figure 5 shows a graph representation of ribosome network from human (Figure 5A) and yeast (Figure 5C). Ribosome network is formed by a single highly connected module in both, human and yeast, and both networks present low evolutionary plasticity in their components (Figures 5B and 5D). Figures 5E and 5G show a graph representation for networks from several energetic pathways from human and yeast. Each network comprises components from glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Differently from ribosome network, which is composed by one module, energetic metabolism network possesses several interconnected modules. As we can see in Figures 5F and 5H, the region comprising TCA cycle presents the lowest evolutionary plasticity in both human and yeast. Oxidative phosphorylation presents low, even though not the lowest, evolutionary plasticity and both, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, present the highest evolutionary plasticity of human and yeast energetic metabolism network. Complete graph representation of the networks with gene symbols are available in Additional file 1 (Supplementary Figures S7, S8, and S9).Figure 5 Gene networks EPI. EPI projection onto different graph representation of gene networks from S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens are shown, with the respective network topologies. The nodes represent genes and the links represent protein-protein interaction of gene products (A, C, E and F). The color landscape indicates the EPI (B, D, F, and H). The nodes were colored according to the pathways they belong (A, C, E and F). Nodes with more than one color belong to more than one pathway evaluated (E and G). To complete list of genes, please see Additional file 1 (Supplementary Figures S7, S8, and S9), Additional file 5 (H. sapiens genes) and Additional file 6 (S. cerevisiae genes).Discussion Genetic plasticity estimative can be useful to different fields such as genetic diseases and evolution. For example, plasticity of a gene or a gene network can help finding components involved in pathology development as well as indicating possible therapeutical targets. Also, evolutionary novelty will probably appear on genome change-tolerant portions. The tolerance to modifications can be measured by directly modifying a gene structure or by estimating the gene variation in a population. Besides gene deletion experiments (a possible way of changing gene network structure), the presence of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (a way of estimating gene variation in a population) would be possible alternatives to evaluate genetic plasticity. However, a single nucleotide mutation may or not lead to a functional modification, depending on the site it occurs, leading to misevaluation of genetic plasticity. Copy number polymorphism (CNP) might work better in plasticity evaluation, mainly regarding entire deletions and duplication. In Drosophila melanogaster, for instance, around 8% of genes are at least partially duplicated and 2% are at least partially deleted, showing CNP as a common phenomenon and, consequently, an interesting target for genetic plasticity evaluation [35]. Genomic information has been largely used to predict biological function, from gene/protein function to entire gene/protein network architecture [14]. Co-inherence has been used to predict functional interaction between proteins [36] and computational techniques such as network alignment has been used to identify conserved pathways, manly in closely related organisms [37]. However, the evolutionary plasticity of orthologous groups has never been systematically analyzed. Here, we have presented a large scale data analysis concerning the distribution of gene families across eukaryotes to identify conserved and plastic orthologous groups. It is noticeable the differences in orthologous groups distribution among eukaryotic genomes and those differences certainly hold biological information. The presence of a KOG component restricted to few eukaryotes indicate at least two possibilities: (i) the ancestral gene of this orthologous group arrived late in evolution and its orthologs are only observed in more recent taxa or (ii) the ancestral gene of this orthologous group arrived early, but its orthologs were lost in some of the taxa. Independently of the reason why a given orthologous group shows a patchy distribution among eukaryotes, it is clear that these orthologs are not required by all organisms. Conversely, a gene family widely found in eukaryotes plays an important role in virtually all organisms of this domain. Widely distributed genes have been described as being subject to stronger purifying selection as compared to young and less broadly distributed genes [6,7,18]. One hypothesis to explain these observations suggests that novel genes present an initial high evolutionary rate phase. At the end of this phase, there is a decrease in evolutionary rate due to an increased functional constraint [6]. Recent works in D. melanogaster have shown an adaptive evolution of young genes and an increased purifying selection as genes become older, corroborating that hypothesis [38,39]. Therefore, genes belonging to essential ancient gene networks, which optimized their roles early in evolution, are expected to present high conserved components across a species tree as well as few drastic modifications in the course of their evolution. On the contrary, genes which arrived late in evolution - or even in ancient non-essential gene networks - might present a patchy distribution among eukaryotes. Other important feature concerning orthologous groups is represented by gene duplication. Why some genes possess several paralogs whereas other genes maintain one-to-one orthology relationships? Despite gene duplication occurring randomly, some genes are prone to fix a duplication event while other genes avoid duplication. The fixation of a duplication event is commonly associated with function improvement in new-born duplicated copies. A very good example is given by Jones and Begun in their study involving three independent events of evolution of chimeric fusion genes in D. melanogaster. All three studied genes are derived Adh and all three genes experienced a rapid evolution on the beginning of their history, followed by a slower adaptive evolution. Additionally, the authors have observed an intriguing similarity in the pattern of evolution including temporal, spatial, and types of amino acid changes in these proteins [39]. Those data strongly suggest that the parent-protein characteristics might determine the path a possible copy will experience, including whether or not it will be fixed or eliminated. According to EAC theory, genes exercising more than one function (i.e. genes presenting functional plasticity) are prone to fix a possible duplication event [28,40]. EPI is based on drastic changes in the history of orthologous groups such as gene duplication and gene deletion. However, a gene may experience different degrees of changes. A gene highly tolerant to mutations will accumulate alterations in its nucleotide sequence on the course of its history. On the contrary, a gene lowly tolerant to mutations will present few nucleotide alterations in its evolutionary history. A complementary, independent measure of the plasticity of an orthologous group is then given by the similarity among the sequences of their proteins. Low evolutionary distances indicate that the proteins present very similar amino acid sequences. Consequently, they suffered few modifications as compared to those proteins presenting high evolutionary distance. According to our results, EPI is correlated to the evolutionary distance measure, suggesting that genes widely distributed among eukaryotes and possessing few paralogs are subject to purifying selection, reinforcing the idea that they are conserved, low plastic genes. A recent work involving gene families in primates has shown an interesting relationship among family size conservation, evolutionary rates and gene essentiality. According to the authors, genes within size conserved families present lower evolutionary rate and a higher proportion of essential genes compared to genes within non size conserved families from human, chimpanzee and rhesus [41]. Those results suggest that our observation concerning duplicability, diminished evolutionary rate, and increased essentiality can also be observed by analyzing gene families in closely related organisms. The idea is not new that essential genes are subjected to stronger selective constraints and, consequently, evolve slower than nonessential genes [42]. In this sense, evolutionary plasticity could be the reflex of genetic plasticity. According to our results, genes associated with lethality are significantly more related to low plastic orthologous groups than genes associated with no abnormal phenotype in both S. cerevisiae and M. musculus. Therefore, the evolutionary history of a gene, i.e. the distribution of their orthologs among different organisms, might bring information about the relevance of their role. However, some less common exceptions may occur. It may happen that some new duplicated genes evolve to perform essential functions, as represented by essential genes with high EPI. Chen and collaborators have shown new genes that rapidly became essential in D. melanogaster, exercising crucial roles mainly in intermediary or late stages of development [38]. However, a wide distributed gene without duplication and deletion episodes probably exercise important biological role, suggesting that EPI may have more acuity to determine low plastic genes than to high plastic genes. Our hypothesis that the evolutionary plasticity of an orthologous group can be an indicative of genetic plasticity of genes within that orthologous group has been applied to ribosome and energetic metabolism gene networks, showing interesting results. Ribosomes are known as ancient molecular fossils that have arrived before the LCA of all living organisms [43]. As it has been shown here, ribosome gene networks of both S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens present very low EPI. The entangled network topology indicates an intricate relationship among the partners of this very ancient low plastic gene network. On the other hand, central metabolism has been described as highly variable among different prokaryotes [44,45]. Here, we have found fatty acid metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis as the highest plastic portion in central metabolism. Despite glycolytic pathway might have arrived early in evolution, its components are not conserved across the species and glycolysis has been described as a high plastic and versatile pathway [46]. Contrasting to glycolysis, TCA cycle represents the lowest EPI portion of the energetic metabolism network. Among the few works that have investigated the evolution of TCA cycle in eukaryotes, a recent paper has shown evolutionary similarity between mitochondria from S. cerevisiae and Rickettsia prowazekii in topological analyses based on network alignment and motif identification [47]. In the same work, the authors have described the mitochondria network as highly clustered around the TCA cycle. R. prowazekii is a mitochondria-related alpha-proteobacteria [48] and TCA cycle pathway seems to be closely related among eukaryotes and its ancestor prokaryote. Those assumptions agree with the results shown here, suggesting TCA cycle as low plastic and highly conserved among the eukaryotes. Despite the results shown here cannot be generalized to all biological networks, it opens a perspective on developing an extensive research concerning EPI and networks properties, such as node connectivity and clustering coefficient, as well as network centrality. In the last decades, the advances in modern genomics have provided a powerful framework in the evolutionary research field. The availability of an enormous amount of completely sequenced genomes, including a great range of organisms, has provided new insights in evolutionary relationships involving genes, pathways, and species. EPI consists in a simple useful method that brings valuable complement in evolutionary studies and provides insights in other research fields such as pathology research and drug design. Clearly, the species set utilized in the orthologous group formation is essential to its diversity, abundance, and consequently to EPI determination. We avoid using the entire COG database due to its unequal distribution concerning the three domain of life (i.e. 532 bacteria, 43 archaea and 55 eukarya). EPI can be applied to any species group to identify the evolutionary plasticity of gene families in related species. However, the researcher must take care with the evolutionary relationship among the species used in EPI determination to avoid biased results. Many evolutionary questions, such as the exact factors determining gene and gene networks evolvability, are still unsolved. Despite our work does not clarify how and why the modifications of some gene networks are constrict on the course of evolution, EPI represents one step in evolutionary relationship understanding by identifying which gene families have been more or less stable on the course of evolution.Conclusions Our results suggest that the distribution of gene families brings valuable information on how plastic and how conserved a gene family is. It is possible to discriminate among conserved and plastic orthologous groups by evaluating their abundance and diversity. In addition, the evolutionary plasticity, measured according to orthologous group distribution as shown here, is coherent with other plasticity measures such as constriction in amino acid sequence modifications throughout evolution and essentiality in mouse and yeast. Finally, the evolutionary plasticity index measured according to abundance and diversity of gene families is consistent with the knowledge about the evolutionary conservation of ribosome gene network as well as the evolutionary plasticity of energetic metabolism gene network.MethodsData selection Several databases offer tools in order to identify gene families. Each database utilizes its specific algorithm to find homology relationships according to specific purposes, such as to search orthologous genes/proteins along species or to search groups of genes/proteins which present the same last common ancestor (i.e. orthologous groups). However, the general strategy used by almost all database is to compare nucleotide sequences among different species [49-51] (to further discussion see Additional file 1, section 1.1). COG (Cluster of Orthologous Groups) database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG presents a useful approach to identify orthologous groups. In COGs construction algorithm, all proteins encoded by the complete genomes analyzed are compared and for each protein, the best hit (BeT) in each different genome is detected. To name it as a cluster, it is necessary to form a triangle including BeT in at least three different organisms. Each COG represents a gene/protein family, including both orthologs and paralogs from different genomes, which have evolved from the same ancestral gene through a series of speciation and duplication events [52]. Besides COGs, which include eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins, the database provides a tool involving only eukaryotic proteins. KOG (Eukaryotic Clusters of Orthologous Group) utilizes the same algorithm to find orthologous groups; however, it only works with eukaryotic genomes [53]. STRING database string-db.org has amplified the COG orthology information by creating more groups and adding extra species, totalizing 630 fully sequenced organisms with 55 eukaryotes among them [49]. Here, orthologous groups were accessed through STRING database version 8.2 stringdb.org [49], in download section. Only eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOG) were evaluated, resulting in a total of 4,850 KOGs. This dataset comprises 481,421 proteins distributed among 55 eukaryotes.Distribution of orthologous groups An orthologous group corresponds to a set of genes belonging to different species, which have a common gene ancestor. To obtain a quantitative expression of the proteins distribution for each KOG (i.e. distribution of the items of a given KOG), we used Shannon Information Theory [9,21] defined as follows. Consider n as the number of selected KOGs, each one representing an orthologous group. Each KOG is labeled by α (α = 1,...,n) and has Nα items (orthologous and paralogous genes), distributed among M possible organisms. Consequently, for a given KOG we can define s(i,α) as the number of items of a given organism i, (i = 1,..., Mα), whose sum for a given α adds up to Nα. The probability p(i,α) that, among the Nα items of the α-KOG, a KOG randomly chosen, belongs to the organism i is written as(1a) such that . The normalized Shannon information function Hα is defined as(2) where we have divided by ln(M) in order to normalize the quantities, guaranteeing that 0≤ Hα≤1. Observe that if there is one gene per organism, Nα = M, p(i,α) = 1/M, and Hα = 1. In fact, Hα reflects the spread of the distribution s(i,α), i.e., it measures the diversity that exists in the α-th KOG. Hα near 0 indicates poor diversity, while a Hα close to 1 suggests high diversity. The abundance Dα of a given KOG was measured by obtaining the ratio between the number of items (orthologous and paralogous proteins) present in the KOG and the number of organisms containing items from this KOG. Dα vary from 1 to virtually infinite (despite the higher abundance found here was around 260) and represents the average of orthologous and paralogs per species for a given KOG. The diversity and abundance was conducted using the software GenPlast. GenPlast have been designed by our research group to perform the plasticity analysis presented in this paper. The software has been developed in the java platform, is under an open source license, and is freely available at http://lief.if.ufrgs.br/pub/biosoftwares/genplast.Molecular evolutionary analysis Molecular evolutionary analysis was conducted using MEGA version 4 [31]. 5% of the KOGs present in STRING (243 KOGs) was sorted according to the EPI and aligned amino acid sequences of all proteins comprising each KOG was obtained from STRING database string-db.org [49]. FASTA sequences were converted in MEGA format by the software. The number of amino acid substitutions per site between sequences was analyzed by the software set in "protein sequences". All results were based on the pairwise analysis sequences. Analyses were conducted using the Poisson correction method in MEGA4 [31,32]. All positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only in pairwise sequence comparisons (Pairwise deletion option). The Poisson Distance average of all proteins contained in each KOG evaluated was also obtained using MEGA4. To complete list of sorted KOGs, please see Additional file 2 (Supplementary Table S4).Lethality Evaluation Saccharomyces cerevisiae data was obtained from Saccharomyces Genome Database http://www.yeastgenome.org[16]. Genes associated to inviability when knocked-out was obtained using the SGD advanced search with step 1 (select chromosomal feature) set in "ORF" and step 2 (narrow results), box phenotype properties, set in "Inviable". Genes associated to viable phenotype when knocked-out was obtained following the same procedure, except by shift "inviable" by "viable" in phenotype properties box. The complete list of S. cerevisiae genes with phenotype annotations used here is available in Additional file 3 (Supplementary Table S5). Mus musculus data was obtained from Mouse Genome Informatics http://www.informatics.jax.org[54] in download area, file "Genotypes and Mammalian Phenotype Annotations (tab-delimited)". The following phenotype annotations were considered together to form the group "early lethality": embryonic lethality before implantation [MP:0006204], embryonic lethality at implantation [MP:0008527], embryonic lethality between implantation and placentation [MP:0009850], embryonic lethality before somite formation [MP:0006205], and embryonic lethality before turning of embryo [MP:0006206]. Genotypes with more than one target allele were discarded. Genes possessing the phenotype annotation "no abnormal phenotype detected [MP:0002169]" were considered to form the "viable" group. MGI BioMart version 0.7 http://biomart.informatics.jax.org was utilizing to find knock-out target genes. Genes combining MP:0002169 and any other phenotype annotation associated with lethality (MP:0005374, MP:0002081, MP:0002058, MP:0002080, MP:0008762, MP:0008527, MP:0006204, MP:0009850, MP:0006205, MP:0006206, MP:0006207, MP:0006208, MP:0005373, MP:0008569, and MP:0002082) were discarded. After that, all resultant genes codifying proteins preset in KOG dataset was utilized. The complete list of M. musculus genes with phenotype annotations used here is available in Additional file 4 (Supplementary Table S6).Network Plasticity The protein-protein interaction networks were generated using information from KEGG http://www.genome.jp/kegg/[51] and STRING string-db.org [49] databases in two steps. First, the gene set of human and yeast pathways evaluated was obtained from KEGG. Only human genes identified in HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee http://www.genenames.org/[55] and yeast genes identified in Saccharomyces Genome Database http://www.yeastgenome.org[56] were used. Second, protein interaction was obtained using STRING database with input options "databases", "experiments", and 0.700 confidence level. STRING integrates different curated public databases containing information on direct and indirect functional protein-protein associations. Network was constructed including only interacting genes/proteins and results from the search were saved and further handled in Medusa software [57]. Evolutionary plasticity of each network was determined in two steps. First, the EPI of each protein from the network was determined according to the EPI of the KOG to which the protein takes part. Second, the evolutionary plasticity data was plot onto the network using the software ViaComplex [58] to construct a landscape representation. The complete list of H. sapiens genes used to construct the networks is available in Additional file 5 (Supplementary Tables S7) and the complete list of S. cerevisiae genes used to construct the networks is available in Additional file 6 (Supplementary table 8).Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributions RJSD designed the study, performed the analysis, discussed the results, and write the manuscript.

This reviewer provided no comments for publication.Reviewer 2 Hiroyuki Toh, The authors evaluated the evolutionary plasticity based on the diversity and the abundance of the orthlogous genes. The authors found that the plasticity is associated with the inviability of yeast and the early lethality of mouse. The approach is interesting. However, I found several problems in the manuscript. Following is the list for possible amendment.Major: problems (1) The authors defined "genetic plasticity" as the ability of a functional gene network to tolerate the alterations in its components or structures (p. 3 line 7 Background). In page 7 (Results, Evolutionary Plasticity Index), the authors defined "evolutionary plasticity" as formula (1), which is calculated with the diversity and the abundance of orthologous genes. (1-1) Is the term "genetic plasticity" equivalent with the term "evolutionary plasticity"? Authors' response: Actually, these two concepts are different. Genetic plasticity is a gene property, while evolutionary plasticity is an orthologous group property. Genetic plasticity, as described on the manuscript, corresponds to the gene (or gene network) capacity to tolerate changes and the evolutionary plasticity, defined by Eq.1, is the record of changes a given gene family have experienced through its evolutionary history. We rewrite a substantial part of the introduction to clear both concepts. We also added additional discussion to elucidate the differences, as well as the relationships, between both. (1-2) If the two terms are used to indicate the same thing, it is not clear why the value calculated with the diversity and the abundance of the orthologous genes can indicate the ability of a gene network, since the formula (1) is given for a component of a gene network. Authors' response: As mentioned above, genetic plasticity and evolutionary plasticity are not the same thing. However, we propose a relationship between both. Starting to the point that genes do not work alone in an organism, the capacity of a gene to tolerate changes will certainly be influenced by their gene network. Additional discussions were added to the manuscript involving the relationship among the gene plasticity and the gene network plasticity. (2) about the term "paralog" used in the manuscript. The authors used the eukaryotic clusters of orthologous group (KOG) in this study. To define the diversity and the abundance in p. 17 - 18 (Methods, Distribution of orthologous groups), the authors used not only orthologs but also paralogs. The description iseems to be confusing for the readers who are not so familiar with the genome science, since the term paralog" used in the manuscript is not the general one, I think that the authors wanted to indicate "co-ortholog" by "paralog". So, I think that a KOG does not include the distant paralogs. I recommend the authors to check the usage of the terms. Unless only close paralogs or co-orthologs are considered for the calculation of formula (1) in p. 18, the diversity loses the meanings. If the authors wanted to include the distant paralogs for the calculation, the consideration of the taxonomic bias may be required. Likewise, the definition of the abundance may be too naïve. Let's consider two cases with two species. In the first case, only one species has 99 paralogs, whereas the other has one orthologs. Da is calculated as (1+99)/2 = 50 in this case. In the other case, the first species has 50 paralogs and the other has remaining 50 copies. In this case, Da is calculated as (50 + 50)/2 = 50. That is the same values are obtained for the two cases. The first case may reflect a trend for the species specific gene amplification, whereas the second case may suggest the duplicability of the orthoologs. I think that the taxonomic bias should be taken into account for the calculation of Da. Authors' response: In fact, there are some controversies involving the terms ortholog and paralog. Other terms such as co-ortholog, inparalog, outparalog, pseudoortholog, pseudoparalog, etc, can be added to the debate. The strict description of each of those terms is not the point here. Our point is to discriminate among orthologous groups possessing one ortholog per species analyzed and orthologous groups possessing many orthologs (or co-orthologs) per species analyzed. Additionally, we analyze the distribution of ortholog among species to discriminate broadly distributed orthologous groups from poorly distributed orthologous group. As we do not include taxonomic relationships in the analysis, we analyze the set of species as a whole, independently of the distance among them. A fungi-specific orthologous group, for instance, will present low diversity. In the same way, a primate specific orthologous group also will present low diversity. In contrast, an orthologous group that has components equally present in all species evaluated will have high diversity. In what concerns KOG database, it intends to identify all eukaryotic genes which evolve from the same ancestral gene. We agree with the reviewer in their comment relative to abundance. Abundance cannot be used without diversity to evolutionary plasticity inference, as shown in Figure 3B. This is the reason why we use the abundance combined to diversity. Examining the suggested example: Case 1: one species has 99 paralogs, whereas the other has one ortholog. In this case, the abundance is 50 and the diversity is 0.080793136. Accordingly, EPI is 0.988574125. Case 2: one species has 50 paralogs, whereas the other has 50 copies. The abundance is 50, exactly equal the case 1. The diversity, however, is 1. In this second case, EPI is 0.858578644. As shown, different orthologous groups presenting equal abundance but different diversity will have different EPI.Minor problems (1) The authors pointed out the importance of neo-functionalization after gene duplication. However, the authors did not mention sub-functionalization. I think that the dubfunctionalization is also related to the evolutionary plasticity. Why did the authors neglect the subfunctionalization. Authors' response: The theories discussed on the manuscript (i.e. neo-functionalization and EAC) are two important examples among many others about gene duplication theory. Since the reviewer judged important to mention sub-functionalization, a comment about that theory has been added on the manuscript. (2) The authors used "aminoacid" instead of amino acid in the manuscript. I think that "amino acid" is ordinarily used. Authors' response: It has been modified. (3) p. 19 -20 (Methods, Fitness Evaluation The term "fitness" is used for different meanings from that in the evolutionary biology and the population genetics. I recommend the authors to use different term to express "fitness" in their manuscript. Authors' response: We have replaced "fitness" by "genes involved with lethality when knocked-out" (4) p.10 (Results, Functional Plasticity Analysis) naïve idea on evolution It may be my misunderstanding, but some descriptions in p.10 seem to be naïve as an evolutionary statement. (4-1),p. 10 line 1 "increase in complexity is a hallmark of evolution. Evolutionary biologists do not consider so. Degeneration and neural change are also important to consider the evolution. Authors' response: We agree with the reviewer. In fact, there are examples of evolution by diminishing the complexity. The meaning intended with the sentence is related to life as a whole. Since first life forms have arrived, crescent levels of complexity can be observed in life organization. Despite simple organisms still represent the majority of the life forms, the complex relationships between different organisms and the environment is noticeable. To avoid misunderstanding we have changed "evolution" by "life" on the manuscript. (4-2) p. 10 lines 2 - 4 However, impairment in biological networks whose have arrived early in evolution (i.e. before multicellularity) might lead to early developmental lethality. (5-1) whose ----➩ which Authors' response: Alteration has been done. (5-2) There is no rationale or citation for this statement, but the authors seemed to follow the recaptulation theory by Heckel, which is still in debate. The authors should provide the rationale of this statement. Authors' response: We agree with the reviewer and removed the sentence from the main manuscript. We added an extra section in the Supplementary Material, discussing lethality in multicellular organism. We provide the rationale of that statement on this new section.Reviewer 3 Sebastien Halary,Referee 3 - S. Halary This study proposes an index called Evolutionary Plasticity Index (EPI) to assess the "genetic plasticity" of genes. This index is defined as a function of the abundance (number of genes) and distribution (diversity of organisms having these genes) within the homologous genes family a gene belongs to. EPI was calculated for 4850 KOGs and compared for 243 of them with their Poisson distance average of all proteins they contain. Then, EPI utility was illustrated by comparing the 'plasticity' of lethal against non-lethal genes of S. cerevisiae and M. musculus, and the plasticity of genes involved in interactions/metabolic networks. EPI seems to be a simple tool to assess the diversity of a gene in eukaryotes, and then to be useful to characterize the paralogs richness of a homologous genes family. Nevertheless, this paper does not provide satisfactory arguments to justify the use of EPI rather than the other existing tools used up till now to estimate the diversity within a homologous family. This is mainly because the results are not discussed in sufficient depth. The authors propose to investigate relationships between EPI and lethality or topological position of the protein in a network, but did not compare their results with previous studies on the same subjects, whereas it could be useful to assess the power of their approach. To improve the manuscript, I would recommend that the authors provide concrete examples for which their index outperforms existing indices, or for which the tool is more straightforward. Also, the discussion can be improved by being more specific about optimal condition for this tool and/or by specifying novel applications. From an editorial point of view, this paper is very long, mainly because of repetitions (without taking account of the 6 supplementary files). Many paragraphs are not placed in the suitable chapter. The quality of language could sometimes be improved upon as well. Overall, this results in a confusing article. Authors' response: We thank the reviewer for the extensive revision he had provided. We followed his suggestions as possible, improving substantially the paper. We also identify some misunderstanding and have worked on improve the clearness of the discussions. We agree with the reviewer and made efforts to make the paper as short as possible. We removed some peripheral discussions from the main manuscript to the supplementary files. We also have replaced many paragraphs in order to clear the reading. Language has been revised. In my opinion, this article cannot be published before major editing and some revisions. I have some questions about the methods and the results, which I hope could be useful to improve the manuscript: -How were the 5% of KOGs chosen for the comparison EPI/evolutionary distance? Why 5%? Authors' response: Data analyzed here involves a total of 481,421 proteins distributed among 4850 KOGs. It is a large, however finite, population. To better estimate the relationship among EPI and evolutionary distance, we take a large sample (i.e. n/N>0.05. In our case N = 4850. Accordingly, n would be > 242.5). A sample larger than 5% would be unnecessary and would substantially delay the paper. -There is a correlation between EPI and 'evolutionary distance', but it would be quite dangerous to resume the second by the first. These values provides more complementary than comparable information. You can find 2 KOGs with the same EPI, and very different means of distance (Figure 3A). Anyway, the authors discuss neither, nor do they comment on the relevance of their index. Which methods already exist to assess diversity of genes within a homologous family? Why is your index better than others or what kind of supplementary information can it provide? Authors' response: We completely agree with the reviewer. Evolutionary distance is complementary to EPI since both evaluate different classes of changes. While EPI identify entire gene alterations (i.e. duplication and deletion episodes), evolutionary plasticity evaluate the amino acid variation among the proteins. Since each measure evaluates different things, one cannot be explained exactly by a function of the other. Our results show that wide-distributed orthologous groups that have experienced few duplications and deletions episodes tend to have proteins more similar among each other (according to amino acid sequence), i.e. we found a coherent relationship between EPI and evolutionary distance, as shown by Figure 3A. We have amplified the discussion about EPI and evolutionary distance relationship to clear it and to avoid misunderstanding. Our analysis does not attempt to replace any existing method and the point here is the possibility to evaluate a great amount of data and extract information from it. The relationship among orthologs distribution and the orthologous group plasticity cannot be neglected and the present manuscript is the first work concerned in systematizing this relationship. We also have improved the discussion on other works concerning in evaluate gene networks plasticity to clear the usefulness of our research. -The list of genomes in STRING DB (as I can read in the legend of Figure S5) is composed by 34 genomes from animals, 14 from fungi, 1 from plant and 6 from "protists" (belonging to 3 different kingdoms). First, for the figure S5A, if you choose to make the distinction between animals and fungi which are phylogenetically quite close. It could make sense to also make the distinction between the "protists" (mycetozoa, euglenozoa, alveolata and diplomonads) which are very distant from each other. Second, since there is just one plant in the dataset, you are not able to see the plant-specific KOGs and thus, you could underestimate the number of plant-specific paralogs and EPIs. Following the same reasoning, this study cannot be adapted to non-fungal unicellular organisms of the dataset. Actually, the dataset seems to be only suitable to assess animal and fungal protein diversity. What do you think about the possibility to adapt the set of genomes per study, to the organism of interest? Authors' response: The figure S5 attempts to show the EPI differences comparing complex multicellular and unicellular/simple multicellular organisms. Our intention is to discuss the relationship among the organism complexity (i.e. multicellular, unicellular) and EPI. The phylogenetic relationship among the groups is not the point here. We removed the figure S5A since we judge figure S5B as sufficient to discussion. Additionally, we add a new section on supplementary material to better discuss the results concerning EPI in different organisms. Regarding the second point, we agree with the reviewer. Species set is not appropriated to obtain conclusions on specific taxonomic groups such as plants. This is the reason way we do not infer any conclusion based on specific taxonomic groups. On the contrary, we just evaluated if an orthologous group is wide-distributed or narrowly-distributed among the 55 eukaryotes analyzed. We think is a good idea to use EPI to evaluate subsets of organisms and thank the referee for the suggestions. We add on the manuscript a discussion about this possibility. -There are some "lethal proteins" with high EPI. Could you present one of these cases and discuss that? Authors' response: We have added an example of lethality in novel proteins of D. melanogaster. Additionally, we extend the discussion (supplemental material) regarding EPI and lethality. -You present lethal/non-lethal proteins study and network plasticity as two different cases of application, but it is probable, at least for some proteins, that their "lethality status" is related to their centrality and/or connectivity in the interactions network. Authors' response: We agree with and thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Indeed, many works have suggested an association among lethality and different networks properties, such as centrality and connectivity. Here, we found a connection between lethality and evolutionary plasticity, and a possible relationship among evolutionary plasticity, lethality, and networks properties may exist. One of ours perspectives is to perform a research involving evolutionary plasticity and networks properties. -You cite Li et al. 2006, which present the study of duplicability of genes in yeast. You could have cited also Chen et al 2010 (MBE) article which present a close investigation in humans. More precisely, I think you could have compared their results to yours to assess the efficiency and usefulness of your index before applying it to another question, even a simple one, to improve the quality of your discussion. You have focused your discussion exclusively on the importance of duplication in evolution, but you did not provide new evidence or hypotheses. Authors' response: We thank the reviewer to suggest the very good paper of Chen and collaborators. We have used their results in our discussion about duplicability and evolutionary rate. - It is a good idea to use your index to study diversity within metabolic/interaction networks. However, even if the 4 shown examples are interesting, they can not constitute any evidence about the importance of low EPI proteins within networks in general. A more convincing approach would have been to make an exhaustive study of protein's EPIs in function of their network's node properties. Centrality and connectivity measures should be useful to identify the proteins that you need to investigate in the aim to discuss about EAC theory, for instance. Authors' response: We completely agree with the reviewer. Our results must be evaluated as an example of EPI utilization. We have added a comment on discussion section to make it clear. As mentioned before, we plan to perform an extensive research involving evolutionary plasticity in a networks perspective. -The Figure 5 is very pretty, but it needs to be modified to improve the clarity of the results. First, (and at least) you must invert the both columns, since even in the text you began by describing the right one. Second, the resolution of the coloration in the left column is too low and it is often difficult to make the correlation between a node and its EPI. I propose to remove this column and to plot coloration directly on the network's nodes. For instance, Cytoscape allows to colorize a node and its outline in different colors. Furthermore, you don't provide a simple description of these networks in the legend and/or in Results: what are nodes, what are edges and what do the edges length mean? Authors' response: First: the columns have been inverted. Second: we think may be a good strategy coloring the nodes to identify EPI values of the genes. However, it is not our objective here. The software ViaComplex, used to produce the figure, work by projecting a landscape onto a network to identify the area of influence of a given property, such as transcription level, lethality, or evolutionary plasticity. The software takes in consideration the nodes and the links between nodes to project the information (here, to project EPI information). To access EPI of a specific gene of the presented networks the reader can check supplementary tables S7 and S8. Third: the figure brings a graph representation of different networks and the information regarding nodes and edges are presented on the figure legend. Additional figures with gene symbols are shown on supplementary material. Please consider these detailed suggestions: p.1: 2 semi-colons in the authors list. Authors' response: The commas have been substituted by semicolons in the author list. p. 2: in the Background section of the Abstract: "duplicability (abundance) and distribution (diversity)". Is the abundance of genes in a COG (breadth of the COG) only a function of their duplicability? Can these 2 words be used as strictly synonyms. Authors' response: Every molecular mechanism involved with the development of new genes might be related to the abundance of an orthologous group. Horizontal gene transfer, for instance, can increase the abundance of an orthologous group by adding extra gene copies in a given genome, increasing the orthologous group abundance as a whole. Nevertheless, such episodes are far from greatly relevant in abundance constitution, mainly in eukaryotic organisms, whereas gene duplication is admittedly the most important mechanism. In addition, the exact molecular mechanism involved in abundance (i.e. gene duplication, reverse transcription, etc.) is not the point here. To avoid misunderstanding, however, we changed the referred sentence on the abstract. p. 3: "Genetic plasticity may be understood...". Exact repetition of the first sentence of the abstract. Authors' response: We have changed the sentence on the background section. p.3: «The analysis of a large scale data about the distribution of genes families (i.e orthologous group)». You did not survey families of orthologous genes stricto sensu, otherwise you should not have observed duplication events. Ortholog being a confusing term, especially when you use COGs from eggNOG database (which provides the db of STRING I think), it would be helpful to fix the definitions of homo/ortho/para-logous gene. Authors' response: We agree with the reviewer in their concernment about orthologs. It has been extensively discussed and there is no consensus about the nomenclature. The evolutionary relationships among genes involve several possible mechanisms that turn difficult to determine if a couple of genes in different species (or sometimes in the same species) are orthologs, coorthologs, paralogs, inparalogs, outparalogs, pseudoorthologs, or pseudoparalogs among each other. Despite such different relationships indeed exist, in practice, however, the identification and classification of homology relationships remains very difficult, mainly to entire genomes comparisons involving several species. The concept of orthologous group is exactly projected to characterize a group of genes with a same common ancestor, which is the meaning intended here. To make it clear, we have added this concept on the manuscript as well as the citation of a very explicative review wrote by Professor Koonin. Regarding the origin of the dataset, eggNOG and KOG represent distinct projects. KOG is based on a robust manual expert annotation whereas eggNOG is automatically and computationally constructed. For reference, please check Muller et al Nucl Acids Res 2010, 38: D190-D195. Then, the sentence p.4 « It is noticeable some orthologous groups possess one-to-one relationships, while there are gene families composed by a great number of paralogs» could be replaced by «Then, some homologous gene families are only composed by orthologs, while others possess a great number of paralogs too.» Authors' response: We think that to consider as orthologs all one-to-one relationship could be a mistake in some cases, according to discussed above. Let's examine the following example: There are two out-paralogs (gene A and gene A') in two related species (species x and species y). In this example, the gene Ax (i.e. the gene A from the species x) is ortholog of Ay (i.e. the gene A from the species y) and the gene A'x is ortholog of A'y. However, during the speciation process, the ortholog A has been deleted in a new species w (which possess only the gene A'w) and the ortholog A' has been deleted in another new species k (which possesses only the gene Ak). Analyzing the species w and k, the genes A'w and Ak are not orthologs among each other in spite of a one-to-one relationship involving the referred genes. Again, is very difficult to determine the exactly evolutionary relationship among genes. This is the reason way we prefer to use the orthologous group concept in our analysis. p.3: «from broad orthologous group» groups. Authors' response: The alteration has been done. p. 3 to p. 4: «In a previous paper, we analysed [...] to the genes which codifying such proteins. » These lines must be displaced in the last paragraph of the introduction. Furthermore, the syntax is not correct in « the genes which codifying such proteins ». Authors' response: The lines have been replaced and the last sentence has been removed. p. 6: «To assess the distribution of each KOGs», I would prefer «To assess the distribution of genes within each KOGs». In the same way, maybe you can change the title to make it more precise. Authors' response: The alterations have been done. p. 7: «As mentioned above, a KOG presenting Hα and Dα [...] few duplications episodes.» This sentence can be removed. Authors' response: The sentence has been removed. p. 7: «It is reasonable to think that a KOG with those [...] Hα indicates a high plastic orthologous group.» More Discussion or Introduction than Results. Authors' response: The sentence has been modified. p. 7: «The distribution of KOGs is dislocated». Is "dislocated" the best term ? Authors' response: The term has been replaced. p. 8: «Accordingly, a randomly chosen protein has [...] characteristic of an index (to further discussion, see Additional file 1, section 1.2).» Discussion Authors' response: The sentence has been modified. p. 8: « Genes can differ according to evolutionary rates [...] plasticity evaluation of a gene family.» Discussion Authors' response: I agree with the reviewer that the discussion section would be a good place to the pointed sentence. However, we prefer provide a short introduction to situate the reader on the issue that will be presented. Additionally, the maintenance of the sentence will not disturb the objective of the section. p. 8: «We compared the aminoacid sequences [...] those proteins presenting high evolutionary distance.» Methods Authors' response: To the same reasons discussed above, we prefer to maintain a substantial part of the paragraph. The end of the paragraph, however, has been placed in the discussion section. p.8 to p. 9: «A gene highly tolerant to mutations [...]few nucleotide alterations in its evolutionary history.» Not Results. Authors' response: The sentence has been placed in the discussion section. p. 9: «That result suggests that genes widely distributed [...] they are conserved low plastic genes.» «Those results reinforce [...] than Dα or Hα individually.» Discussion. Furthermore, EPI better than Dα or Hα, but is EPI better than 'evolutionnary distance' ??? Authors' response: First, the sentences have been placed in the discussion section. Second, we did not make that statement regarding EPI better than evolutionary distance. Evolutionary distance is a measure of the divergence of amino acid sequence among proteins, i.e. it evaluates changes in protein's structures. EPI works with other kind of changes: gene duplications and gene deletions. So, they are complementary measures. p. 9: « Starting to the point that low [...] fitness impact when knocked-out...» to simplify. Authors' response: The paragraph has been rewritten. p.9: «S. cerevisiae information was obtained [...]Genome Informatics (MGI) [21].» Methods Authors' response: The sentence has been removed. p. 9: « Is not new the idea that [...] annotation associated with lethality in MGI.» Introduction/Discussion/Methods...not Results. Authors' response: A substantial part of the paragraph has been placed on discussion section. p.11: « To analyze the evolutionary plasticity [...] (i.e. the EPI of the orthologous group of each gene from the network) onto network topology. » Methods Authors' response: We believe that a brief introduction is important for a better presentation of the results of Figure 5. p. 12: «The evaluation of the history of a gene or a gene network is fundamental to understand its evolutionary behavior.» Do you mean that we need to know the evolution of a gene to understand its evolution? I think this sentence is not useful. Discussion must be revised. To improve the clarity of the discussion, you can follow the same structure than the Results chapter. Authors' response: The sentence has been removed. We substantially changed introduction and discussion sections. Methods must be simplified. Authors' response: Methods section has been simplified as possible.Supplementary MaterialAdditional file 1 Supplementary Material.

For this purpose, this study was performed at Field Crops and Soil Science Department of Agricultural Faculty of Adnan Menderes University during wheat growth stages of 2007-2008. The experimental design was randomized complete block design with split split plot arrangements. The main plots were temperature applications (heat and normal), the growth periods (Zadoks scale; GS14, GS32, GS14 + GS32, and control) were split plots and varieties were split-split plots. The eight different wheat varieties were evaluated in the pots. The waterlogging was performed during GS14, GS32 and GS14 + GS32. In a pot experiment, plants were subjected to waterlogging to the soil surface for 10 days. All applications and varieties decreased the single plant yield. The waterlogging caused a yield loss compared with wheat grown on well-drained soil. In this study, the crop loss due to waterlogging is highly temperature dependent. The severity of the effects of the waterlogging depends on the growth stage of the plot. When all applications were compared with control by means of yield performance, Sagittario and Basribey varieties were less affected than the others.

Introduction Cereals are the basic products used in human nutrition. Wheat is great importance in cereals. The world annual wheat production is around 689 million tons and plant area is 223 million hectares. The wheat production is 17.8 million tons and plant area is 7.6 million hectares in Turkey [1]. Worldwide, about 10% of all irrigated land suffers from waterlogging. Soaking of agricultural land is caused by a rising water table or excessive irrigation. Waterlogging compacts soil, deprives roots of oxygen, and contributes to salinization. Waterlogging is common in wheat following rice, with plants turning yellow due to oxygen stress. Waterlogging has been shown to limit wheat yields in many regions of the world; an area about 10 million ha is waterlogged each year in developing countries [2]. Wheat has high adaptability for all kinds of climates and regions. Waterlogging which causes oxygen deficieny, will prevent to root and shoot growth, reduce the accumulation of dry matter and as a result of these yield will reduce. Especially, February and March rainfalls in western Turkey lead to the breakdown of cultivated fields and reduction of the yields. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most intolerant crops to soil waterlogging [3]. Prolonged periods of rainfall combined with poor soil drainage often cause low oxygen in the soil. Decrease in soil O2 content, under flooded conditions, is often accompanied by increase in soil CO2 and ethylene content. Such changes have detrimental effects on root and shoot growth of wheat [4]. Productivity from soils susceptible to waterlogging may be increased by drainage and the introduction of waterlogging-tolerant genotypes [3]. High temperatures tend to exacerbate the negative effects of waterlogging. Yield is affected differently, depending on the crop's stage of development at the time stress is applied [5]. On waterlogged sites, plants show chlorosis and necrotic spots on older leaves. Both Mn toxicity and N deficiency may be induced by the low redox potential in waterlogged soils that produces plant-available Mn2+ and promotes denitrification of NO3−. Under these anaerobic conditions, root metabolism and root growth are inhibited, since the lack of O2 affects the energy status of the plant [6]. The colder soil temperatures associated with waterlogging in winter-wheat growing areas reduce the amount of oxygen required for root respiration. Thus yield reductions associated with waterlogging in colder areas are not as great as those in the more temperate and tropical areas of the world [7]. Similarly, some studies show that soil oxygen decline under waterlogging is rapid at most temperature ranges [8]. Chlorosis of lower leaves [9], decreased plant height and lower number of spike-bearing tillers [10], reduced root and shoot growth [11] in the wheat waterlogging areas. The uptake of trace metals by two plant species (French bean and maize) has been measured on two soils subjected to various waterlogging regimes. Uptake of both manganese and iron was increased due to soil waterlogging, although reoxidation of the soil affected iron more than manganese. The abilities of these species to take up trace metals from soil followed the pattern predicted by selective extraction of soil for manganese, iron, and cobalt, but not for zinc and copper [12]. In waterlogged acidic soil, shoot concentrations of aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) increased by two- to 10-fold, and in some varieties they were above critical concentrations compared with plants in drained soil. These elements decreased or remained the same in shoots of plants grown in waterlogged neutral soil [13]. The greater P uptake per unit of root biomass was a consequence of (1) an increase in soil P availability induced by waterlogging, (2) a change in root morphology, and/or (3) an increase in the intrinsic uptake capacity of each unit of root biomass. Soil P content was higher during waterlogging periods and the roots of waterlogged plants showed a higher physiological capacity to absorb P. Soil P availability was higher during waterlogging periods, roots of waterlogged plants showed a morphology more favorable to nutrient uptake (finer roots) and these roots showed a higher physiological capacity to absorb P [14]. Waterlogging is a serious environmental stress on winter wheat grown in western Turkey. In this study, the aim was the determination of tolerant varieties to waterlogging conditions, effects of temperature, and growing stages.2. Materials and Methods This study was conducted in 2007-2008 at the Field Crops Department of the Faculty of Agriculture at Adnan Menderes University in Aydin, Turkey. Aydin province is situated at 37° 39′ E and 27° 52′ N in the west Aegeon Region of Turkey, and typical Mediterranean climatic conditions are dominant in Aydin. To evaluate losses from waterlogging under pot experiments, 8 wheat genotypes were grown under no waterlogging (control) and 10 days of continuous flooding, GS14, GS32, and GS14 + GS32 [15]. After flooding the pots were allowed to come normal dry conditions by evaporation and plant use but without draining. Sufficient water was applied to waterlog from the top down, by applying water in excess of the rate at which it could infiltrate the soil, indicated by surface pooling [16]. Soil iron and soil manganese content (DTPA analysis, [17]), and soil phosphorus content [18] were determined. The experimental design was randomized complete block design with split-split plots. The main plots were temperature applications, the growth plots were Split Plots and varieties were split-split plots. Data on plant height, tiller number, root biomass, shoot biomass, single plant yield, soil iron content, soil manganese content, and soil phosphorus content were taken on five plants per pot, and means were used for data analysis. The experiments were designed in split-split plot design with 3 replications. To increase the temperature, low tunnels were used. The growing conditions (low tunnel and normal) were the main plots, growing periods (GS14, GS32, and GS14 + GS32) were the subplots and cultivars (Golia, Gonen, Basribey, Adana 99, Cumhuriyet 75, Sagittario, Pamukova, Negev) were sub-subplots. The wheat varieties were sown on 27.11.2007 and harvested at 23.05.2008. At maturity, plants were harvested and threshed manually. The data regarding plant height, tiller number, root biomass, shoot biomass, single plant yield, soil iron content, soil manganese content and soil phosphorus content were recorded. The significance of main effects and interactions was determined at the 0.05 and 0.01 probability levels by the F-test. Means of the significant (P ≤ 0.05) main effects and interactions were separated using Fischer's protected LSD test at P = 0.05. The data were statistically analyzed by using a standard analysis of variance technique for a split-split plot design using Tarist software [19].3. Results The soil iron, manganese, and phosphorus contents were given at Table 1. The difference between heat and normal conditions for soil Fe and the accumulation of Fe and Mn for different growing stages were significant (Table 1). The soil Fe content in normal condition was found significantly higher compared with heat condition (Table 2). During waterlogging, O2 in the soil is rapidly depleted, and the soil may become hypoxic or anoxic within a few hours. Moreover, some waterlogged soils become rich in Mn2+ and Fe2+. Waterlogging stress leads to changes in soil conditions which may affect plant growth through oxygen deficiency, reduced nitrogen availability, or manganese toxicity and so on [20]. Table 3 showed the results of variance analysis of the plant height, tiller number, shoot biomass, root biomass, and single plant yield. The results showed that the stage and cultivar factors and their interactions were found significant except for root biomass at growing stage factor. Table 4 was that the the results of variance analysis for heat conditions. The results showed that stage and cultivar interactions were significant except for root biomass. And the root biomass for different stage was nonsignificant. Also, the differences among wheat varieties were significant for observed characters in high temperature. The waterlogging conditions reduced all cultivar's height in GS14 + GS32 than control conditions. The tiller number at different stage was given at Table 5. The waterlogging reduced the number of tiller in wheat. For all treatments, grain losses were much less than expected from the extent of tiller loss in winter, losses after single waterlogging events ranged from 2% (after 47 days with the water table at 5 cm) to 16% (after 80 days with the water table at the soil surface). Yield losses after three waterlogging at the seedling, tillering, and stem elongation stages of growth were additive, and totaled 19% [21]. Transient waterlogging during winter and spring reduces wheat yield. Yield reductions from waterlogging are associated with reduced production and survival of tillers, fewer and smaller fertile tillers, and smaller grain size [22]. Waterlogging induced a transient N deficiency. The N concentration of the youngest expanded leaf on the mainstem and tillers declined markedly during waterlogging, but its recovery 14 days after the waterlogging was ended was independent of treatment, reaching the critical minimum concentration of 3.5%. The growth of primary tillers 1 and 2 was severely inhibited by waterlogging while the exertion of new tillers was delayed by 9 days [23]. Figure 1 pointed out plant height at different stages of wheat. Waterlogging significantly reduced plant height and tillering, delayed ear emergence, and resulted in 8, 17, 27, and 39% reduction in grain yield, respectively [24]. Figure 2 showed shoot biomass at different stage of wheat. The waterlogging conditions reduced the shoot biomass values. The other important characteristic for waterlogging is root biomass examined at Figure 3. The lowest root biomass value was found in Adana 99 at GS14. On the other hand the best cultivar was Cumhuriyet 75. Doubled haploid lines grown in waterlogged soil for 49 days ranged from 82% reductions in biomass at the end of waterlogging in acidic soil [25]. The single plant yield values for different stages were given at Figure 4. Results indicated that significant linear responses were found for yield. Reduction of the number of spike after the waterlogging caused a significant decrease of single plant yield.4. Discussion Sparrow and Uren [26] and Wagatsuma et al. [27] stated that soil Mn concentration that could be toxic to plant growth increased in waterlogging. Similarly, mineral Fe coating of epidermal surface of roots increased under waterlogging [28]. In addition, Belford et al. [29] revealed that decreased soil oxygen was generally greater at warmer temperature. Also, in our study the soil Fe and Mn contents of nonwaterlogging pots (control) had significantly lower values, whereas waterlogging applications in both jointing and tillering significantly increased soil Fe and Mn contents. The differences in soil Fe and Mn between conditions and growing stages prepared a suitable condition to evaluate wheat varieties response to waterlogging. There are significant differences in waterlogging tolerance for different growing stages. Diversity occurs in the timing, duration, and severity at waterlogging stress [30]. The highest plant height was found in Adana 99, Golia, Gonen, Sagittario, Basribey and Pamukova were negatively affected in the GS14 (high temperature) and GS14 + GS32 (normal conditions) for plant height. The effects of waterlogging on the Basribey and Adana 99 occurred in the GS14 + GS32 (normal conditions) negatively affected in the early growing stages and increased temperatures (GS14; high temperature). Negev was influenced by waterlogging which occurred during GS14 and GS32 periods, together with heat application. Flooding and increased temperature application were most significant effects for all cultivars. Losses caused by waterlogging need to be measured to determine the importance of traits used as waterlogging tolerance indicators. Kernels per spike and plant height had a less severe reduction from waterlogging, about 30 and 19%, respectively [31]. Taeb et al. [32] revealed that tiller number were decreased during waterlogging, tiller production, shoot dry matter, and root penetration were used for screening Tritieae species for tolerance. When these criteria were used, many wild species expressed a level of tolerance to waterlogging that was better than that of wheat. By the end of the experiment, shoot mass remained lower in plants from waterlogged treatments compared with continuously drained control, due to lower tiller numbers. Comparisons between alternately waterlogged and continuously waterlogged plants showed that in the alternaely waterlogged plants, shoot weights were heavier [3]. The lowest yield was observed in Adana 99 which was exposed to waterlogging at GS32. Correspondingly, the highest value was obtained from Cumhuriyet 75 at GS14 + GS32. In a field study, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop to waterlogging for 1, 2, 4, and 6 days at the time of first irrigation (25-day-old plants) significantly reduced tillering and plant height, delayed ear emergence, and resulted in 8, 17, 27, and 39% reduction in grain yield, respectively [24]. The wheat varieties used as material showed different response to waterlogging. The significant negative effects of waterlogging on cultivars were both tillering and jointing stage (GS14 + GS32) with high temperature. Soil Fe and Mn contents significantly increased in tillering and jointing stage waterlogging applications. Basribey and Sagittario wheat varieties should be suggested as waterlogging tolerance varieties. This study will play an important role for wheat growers in the future as they will be able to make better crop management decisions when they encounter incidence of waterlogging. Huang et al. [11] observed that waterlogging reduced shoot nitrogen content, shoot, and root growth.

In this study, we investigated whether proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may help differentiate spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) from multiple systemic atrophy- cerebellar type (MSA-C). This prospective study recruited 156 patients with ataxia, including spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 17 (N = 94) and MSA-C (N = 62), and 44 healthy controls. Single voxel proton MRS in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis were measured. The differences were evaluated using nonparametric statistic tests. When compared with healthy controls, the cerebellar and vermis NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho were lower in all patients. The Cho/Cr was lower in SCA2 and MSA-C . The NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr were lower in MSA-C or SCA2 comparing with SCA3 or SCA6. The MRS features of SCA1 were in between . The cerebellar NAA/Cho was lower in SCA2 than SCA1, SCA3 or SCA6 . The cerebellar NAA/Cho in MSA-C was lower than SCA3 . In the early stages of diseases (SARA score<10), significant lower NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho in SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 or MSA-C were observed comparing with healthy controls . The Cho/Cr was lower in MSA-C or SCA2 (). Patients with MSA-C and SCA2 had lower NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr than SCA3 or SCA6 . By using MRS, significantly lower NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis were found in patients with ataxia (SCAs and MSA-C). Rapid neuronal degeneration and impairment of membrane activities were observed more often in patients with MSA-C than those with SCA, even in early stages. MRS could also help distinguish between SCA2 and other subtypes of SCAs. MRS ratios may be of use as biomarkers in early stages of disease and should be further assessed in a longitudinal study.

Introduction Cerebellar ataxias can be categorized into two groups: hereditary or sporadic [1]. Sporadic cerebellar degeneration may be the result of intoxication, endocrine disorders or idiopathic causes, such as multiple system atrophy-cerebellar type (MSA-C). Hereditary ataxias have different modes of inheritance with mutations in scores of genes. Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) represents the most common autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia and so far 36 distinct chromosomal loci have been identified. They share similar manifestations, including ataxia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. The diagnosis of MSA-C can only be reached when clinical and laboratory criteria are met in accordance with the international consensus [2]. Patients with MSA-C usually have a rapid clinical progression with a mean survival of 6–9 years. An accurate diagnosis not only foretells the prognosis, makes comprehensive genetic counseling possible, but also helps design the best clinical management. Atrophy and signal intensity changes in the cerebellum and brain stem can be observed in both SCA and MSA-C using magnetic resonance images. Although some characteristic features, such as abnormal signal intensities in the middle cerebellar peduncle, the “hot cross bun” sign and putaminal slit, may be observed in patients with MSA [3], they usually are only discernible in the late stages of the disease. Creatine (Cr) measured in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is related to cell energy pathways and reflects the energy potential available in the brain tissue. Its concentration in normal brain remains very high (7.49±0.12 mmol/kg) and stable and can be used as a reference for comparisons. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is believed to be neuronal and axonal origin in adult brain [4], [5] and is a marker for neuronal integrity, density or volume [6], [7]. A reduction in NAA resonance has been observed in various conditions associated with neuronal loss and/or axonal injury [8]–[12]. Choline (Cho) resonance reflects total Cho stores, derived from glycerophosphocholine and phosphocholine [5]. Loss of Cho reflects a reduction in the production of cell membranes, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and the precursor of acetylcholine, phosphatidylcholine. Previously, changes in MRS in patients with SCA or MSA-C have been reported. [13]–[17]. However, most of the reports only focused on limited subtype of SCA or only described the differences between patients and healthy controls. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether noninvasive MRS may help differentiate between SCAs and MSA-C and between SCA subtypes on a cross-sectional basis.Materials and MethodsPatients and Controls This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. From March 2004 to March 2010, after written informed consent was signed, a total of 94 patients with SCA and 62 patients with MSA-C were recruited into this study. Four patients were molecularly identified to have SCA1, 16 SCA2, 58 SCA3, 10 SCA6 and 6 SCA17. Sixty-two patients met the criteria for MSA-C. The age and disease duration were used as co-variances for MRS parameter analyses. All patients periodically underwent neurological examination, including “Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia” (SARA) [18], [19]and neuroimaging studies with MRS. Forty-four healthy individuals without any history of neurological diseases served as controls. The basal ganglion MRS features were validated, according to normal data proposed by Brain Ross and Else Rubaek Danielsen [20]. The demographic features are listed in Table 1.10.1371/journal.pone.0047925.t001Table 1Demographic features of the subjects.No. of patientsCAG repeat lengthDisease Duration# (years)Age at study# (years)SCA1443.8±4.412.3±12.956.0±2.3SCA21642.9±6.26.5±4.044.9±16.9SCA35873.2±3.98.9±6.250.0±12.7SCA61023.6±1.18.3±7.756.7±11.3*SCA17644.5±2.23.0±3.2§52.0±15.5MSA-C62–5.3±3. 6§§62. 6±7.1**Healthy controls44––51.1±17.9# Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.05.§ Patients with SCA2 or SCA3 had a longer disease duration than those with SCA17, p<0.05.§§ Patients with SCA3 had a longer disease duration than those with MSA-C.* Patients with SCA2 or SCA3 were younger than those with SCA6.** Patients with SCA were younger than those with MSA-C.Image and spectroscopic acquisition Brain MRI and MRS were performed using a 1.5-T system (Signa EXCITE, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). The MRI protocol consisted of an axial T1-weighted three-dimensional fast-spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in steady state images (TR 8.58 msec, TE 3.62 msec, inversion time [TI] 400 msec, voxel resolution 0.75×0.75×1.5 mm3) and an axial T2 fast spin-echo sequence [TR 4000 msec, TE 256.5 msec, voxel resolution 348×512]. After MR imaging, proton MRS was recorded in cerebellar hemispheres and cerebellar vermis by using single-voxel stimulated echo acquisition mode sequence (3000/15/13.7/96 [TR/TE/mixing time/excitations], spectral width = 2500 Hz, number of points = 2048, voxel resolution = 2 cm×2 cm×2 cm). The voxel of interest (VOI) in each subject was placed in a uniform manner by the same investigator (JFL). Care was taken to avoid cerebrospinal fluid spaces within the VOIs. The peak areas for N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) at 2.02 parts per million (ppm), Creatine (Cr) at 3.03 ppm, and Choline (Cho) at 3.22 ppm were measured using the Functool provided by MR company (GE XVi, Milwaukee, WI). Peak integral values were expressed relative to the Cr peak. Metabolite intensity ratios were automatically calculated at the end of each single voxel acquisition including NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr. The NAA/Cho ratio was also calculated for comparison. In order to ensure high quality, MRS results with full width at half maximum (FWHM)>6 Hz were disqualified from the MRS analyses.Statistical Analyses Comparisons of the age at examination and disease duration between the healthy controls and patient groups were performed using nonparametric statistics (Kruskal-Wallis H test) since some of the sample sizes were small and the assumption of a Gaussian distribution was not appropriate. Comparison of the metabolic parameters on MRS (NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres, NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the vermis) between patient groups and healthy controls, between sub-types of SCA and MSA-C and between sub-types of SCA were all performed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test due to non-Gaussian distribution of the MRS parameters. Differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Data are given as mean ± standard deviation. Metabolic ratios on the MRS, clinical ataxia scores (SARA) and disease duration in individual patients were correlated using Spearman's rank test. Differences were considered significant at p<0.05.Results Overall, two NAA/Cr and two Cho/Cr in the vermis from healthy controls, two NAA/Cr and one Cho/Cr in the cerebellar hemisheres, 14 NAA/Cr and 15 Cho/Cr in the vermis from patients with SCA, and 8 NAA/Cr and 6 Cho/Cr in the cerebellar hemispheres, 8 NAA/Cr and 7 Cho/Cr in the vermis from patients with MSA-C were disqualified. Altogether, 88 NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres and 42 NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the vermis from healthy controls, 8 NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres and 3 NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the vermis from patients with SCA1, 31 NAA/Cr, 32 Cho/Cr and 31 NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres and 14 NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the vermis from patients with SCA2, 115 NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres and 48 NAA/Cr, 47 Cho/Cr and 47 NAA/Cho in the vermis from patients with SCA3, 20 NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres and 10 NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the vermis from patients with SCA6, 12 NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres and 5 NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the vermis from patients with SCA17, 116 NAA/Cr, 118 Cho/Cr and 114 NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres and 54 NAA/Cr, 55 Cho/Cr and 54 NAA/Cho in the vermis from patients with MSA-C were included in the statistic analyses.Copmparison with healthy controlsPatients with MSA-C By Mann-Whitney test, the NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis were significantly lower (p<0.0005) in patients with MSA-C.

When SARA scores were analyzed alongside the MRS data, an inverse correlation was found between MRS ratios and SARA scores in all subtypes of SCA and MSA-C. The lower the metabolite ratios, the higher the SARA scores. NAA/Cho correlated well with the duration of disease (p = 0.037 in the cerebellar hemispheres; p = 0.006 in the vermis). However, the disease duration did not correlate with NAA/Cr (p = 0.254) or Cho/Cr (p = 0.354) in the cerebellar hemispheres, or NAA/Cr (p = 0.394) or Cho/Cr (p = 0.251) in the vermis.Discussion SCA and MSA-C share many clinical features but have distinct underlying pathophysiologies leading to progressive neuronal dysfunction. In this study, proton MRS was used to monitor the neuronal damage in vivo and to explore the differences between different subtypes of SCA and MSA-C. The NAA/Cr was particularly lower in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis in patients with MSA-C or SCA2 than those with SCA3 or SCA6. Previously, lower NAA/Cr had been reported in patient with SCA1, SCA2, SCA6 or MSA-C. [14]–[17]. Of note is that, patients with SCA2 had lower NAA/Cr than those with SCA6, even they were of similar clinical severity. [15], [16] Hadjivassiliou M et al. [21]had demonstrated a significant atrophy and lower NAA/Cr in both vermis and cerebellar hemispheres in patients with SCA6. SCA6 is a disease with relatively pure and slowly progressive ataxia and a late age at onset. The less reduction of NAA/Cr in SCA6 may reflect a better reserved functioning of surviving neurons. Lower Cho/Cr in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis was found in patients with SCA2, MSA, SCA3 and SCA6. In particular, lower Cho/Cr in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis in patients with MSA-C than those with SCA2 was noticeable. Although the patient numbers were limited in SCA1 and SCA17 groups, the NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr in the cerebellar hemispheres in SCA1 were lower than those with SCA3 or SCA6 but higher than those with SCA2 and MSA-C. Therefore, MRS features suggest that the neuronal integrity and the activities of membrane synthetic enzymes are better preserved in patients with SCA3, SCA6, followed by SCA17, SCA1 and worst in patients with SCA 2 or MSA-C. The activities of membrane enzyme synthesis are even worse in MSA-C than SCA2.NAA/Cho NAA/Cho has been widely used as a marker for cerebral metabolism [8], [12], [22], [23]. In this study, we observed significantly lower NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres in all patients with SCA or MSA-C, except for SCA 17. Patients with SCA2 had a lower NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres, reflecting a more severe cerebellar damage. The NAA/Cho features indicate that cerebellar metabolisms were higher in SCA3, SCA6 and less so in patients with SCA 2 or MSA-C, consistent with previous PET reports [24].Observations in the early sages of the diseases In the early stages, when cerebellar signs were not salient, the decrease in NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho in patients with MSA-C or SCA has already been noticeable. Therefore, measurement of neurochemical changes by MRS seems to be superior to clinical observation. The Cho/Cr in the vermis in patients with SCA6 was higher than those with SCA3, SCA2 and even the healthy controls. (Table 3) This might be attributable to the limited size (only 4 patients with SCA6) of the patients in the early stage and might not be representative. Lower NAA/Cr in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis in patients with MSA-C might implicate that a significant and faster cerebellar pathology occurring very early in MSA-C [19]. SCA2 and MSA-C are two most severe ataxia diseases with similarly rapid reductions in NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho. Previous studies [14]–[16] suggested that lactate peak and myo-inositol levels might be used to differentiate SCA2 from MSA-C. We found that, Cho/Cr in the vermis and NAA/Cho in the cerebellar hemispheres were lower in patients with MSA-C than those with SCA2 in the early stage of the diseases, (Table 3) and, as time went by, patients with MSA-C tended to have lower Cho/Cr than those with SCA2, despite that their NAA/Cr was similar. (Table 2) This trend may reflect the initial and early neuronal or axonal damage, followed by progressive and rapid impairment of membrane activities specifically in MSA-C. Thus, the Cho/Cr may be used as another marker to differentiate MSA-C from SCA2. Pathologically, SCA2 is characterized by a marked loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex, as well as a loss of myelinated fibers with gliosis in the inferior and middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter and fasciculus cuneatus [25], [26]. In SCA3, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the central white matter of the cerebellum are heavily involved, while the cerebellar cortex and Purkinje cells are mostly spared [27]. In SCA6, the pathology occurs mainly in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex, leaving the dentate nucleus, deep cerebellar white matter and cerebellar peduncles unaffected [28], [29]. The results in this MRS study correlate well with these differences in neuropathology. The synaptic loss in cerebellum and brainstem is most severe in SCA2, followed by SCA1 and SCA6 [30], [31]. The changes in MRS are similarly ranked, as reported by Oz G et al. using 4T MRS [32].Clinical significance Differentiation of subtypes of ataxias was once considered possible using NAA, myo-inositol, total Cr, glutamate and glutamine with a high field 4T MR spectroscopy [16], which, however, is not readily accessible in most clinical settings. In contrast, in this study, we demonstrated that subtle differences between subtypes of SCAs and MSA-C could be discerned simply by using NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho obtained from a 1.5 T MRI. Furthermore, MRS features correlate well with clinical SARA scores. Therefore, MRS biomarkers can be utilized to noninvasively assess neuronal and glial status in individual patients with ataxia. One limitation of this study is the small sample sizes. Although the overall sample sizes are impressive, fewer than 10 subjects were recruited for the SCA1 and SCA17 groups. The limited sample size is difficult to avoid and complicates the statistical analyses, interpretation and inferences at the sub-group level. Since SCA1, 2, 3, 6 and 17 are all polyglutamine diseases with unstable CAG repeat expansion, it would be conceivable to correlate the CAG numbers with clinical and MRS features and to prospectively compare the progressive changes in different subtypes of SCA in a longitudinal study in the future.Conclusion By using MRS, significantly lower MRS ratios, suggestive of neuronal dysfunction and membrane activities impairment, which correlate well with clinical deterioration, were found in patients with SCAs and MSA-C. MRS may be used to in vivo evaluate and monitor the progression of neurodegeneration in ataxia, potentially even in the early stages of SCA or MSA-C.

This review provides an overview of current and new clinical-histological concepts of pediatric NAFLD, going through possible implications into patho-physiolocical and therapeutic perspectives. Introduction Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has recently emerged as the leading cause of chronic liver disease in children [1-3]. The increasing incidence of NAFLD is a mirror of the worldwide annual increment of obese individuals [4-6]. Data from the last National Health Nutrition Examination Survey shows that 17% of all children in western countries are overweight. Among them, 70% to 80% have NAFLD. NAFLD is defined by hepatic fat infiltration >5% hepatocytes, as assessed by liver biopsy, in the absence of excessive alcohol intake, or the evidence of viral, autoimmune or drug-induced liver disease. It includes a spectrum of liver disease ranging from intrahepatic fat accumulation (steatosis) to various degrees of necrotic inflammation and fibrosis (non-alcoholic steatohepatatis [NASH]) [7,8]. Pediatric NAFLD histopathology has distinct characteristics when compared with that of adults [9], but whether these differences are due to different mechanisms in the pathogenesis, or represent two phenotypes, is still unclear. Despite the differences, pediatric NAFLD is associated, as it is in adults, with severe metabolic impairments such as insulin resistance, hypertension and abdominal obesity, determining an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases [10,11]. The natural history and prognosis of NAFLD in children is still uncertain, since published data with long-term follow up is scant. It has been reported that, in susceptible individuals, NAFLD can evolve to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, with the consequent need for liver transplantation [12]. Both genetic and environmental factors seem to be involved in the development and progression of the disease [13,14], and a better understanding of its physiopathology will certainly help in reducing future morbidity and mortality from NAFLD. Moreover, in view of this mounting epidemic phenomenon involving the youth of today, the study and identification of treatment for children and adolescents with this liver disease should be a priority for all health care systems. This review will therefore provide an overview of the current concepts in epidemiology, histological features, etiopathogenesis, and the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric NAFLD, but will particularly aim to go through the new concepts in the aforesaid field and their possible implications into patho-physiolocical and therapeutic perspectives.Epidemiology and risk factors Data published from centers in North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Australia [15-17] demonstrates that NAFLD nowadays interests not only the western countries. Pediatric NAFLD prevalence is estimated to be between 3% and 10%. It varies as such because it is influenced by the characteristics of the population, especially lifestyle habits, and the diagnostic method used to detect it. In fact, although liver histology is the gold standard for diagnosing NAFLD, performing biopsies to determine disease prevalence is not always feasible. Children with NAFLD typically have slightly elevated liver enzyme values (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption and other causes of steatosis [18]. Therefore, elevated serum levels of liver enzymes, even though they often misrepresent the entity of intrahepatic damage, are used as a valuable and noninvasive test to screen for pediatric NAFLD [19]. Alternatively, BMI and ultrasonography can also be used, even though their diagnostic accuracy limitations are the same as those reported for ALT (for instance, fibrosis is undetectable with these methods). One of the few population-based studies published in this field reports data from the United States (NHANES III) [20] showing that the prevalence of elevated ALT levels (> 30 IU/L) was 7.4% among white adolescents, 11.5% among Mexican American adolescents and 6.0% among black adolescents. Elevated ALT levels were present in 12.4% of male subjects compared with 3.5% of female subjects. Data from South Korea [16] and Japan [21] is similar. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that NAFLD prevalence in adolescents is at least 2.6% to 3.2%. As a matter of fact, this data underestimates the real prevalence, since surrogate markers have been used to diagnose NAFLD. An autopsy study by Schwimmer and colleagues [22] reviewed the records and liver histological features of 742 children aged 2 to 19 years, who died from unnatural causes in San Diego County between 1993 and 2003. The prevalence of fatty liver (> 5% of hepatocytes containing macrovesicular fat), adjusted for age, gender, race, and ethnicity was estimated to be 9.6%, although the autopsy cohort was understandably biased relative to the general population, due to overrepresentation of Hispanic boys. Despite the diversity of diagnostic criteria used in population-based studies, obesity is the main risk factor for pediatric NAFLD. In fact, the prevalence of NAFLD in obese children increases up to 80% in several obesogenic countries, including USA, Europe and Japan [21-26]. Huang et al. [27] recently reported that in 219 schoolchildren, aged 6 to 12 years, rates of NAFLD were 3% in the normal-weight range, 25% in the overweight range, and 76% in obese children. A population-specific based study [28] has been performed in Europe. One-hundred-and-eleven specialized pediatric obesity centers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland were involved, and 16,390 overweight, obese and extremely obese children and adolescents were included and studied for NAFLD. NAFLD was defined by AST and/or ALT > 50 Ul-1. NAFLD was present in 11% of the study population, predominantly in boys (boys vs girls; 14.4:7.4%; P<0.001), and in the extremely obese group (obese vs extremely obese; 9.5:17.0%; P<0.001). NAFLD in children is also strongly associated with several other features of the metabolic syndrome (MS), especially insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus [29,30]. It also increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in adulthood. A recent cohort of pediatric patients has been studied for carotid intimal medial thickness as a marker of atherosclerosis. This was significantly greater in obese children diagnosed with NAFLD, than that in the control group, indicating that obese children with NAFLD are associated with a greater risk of atherosclerosis and future adverse cardiovascular events [31]. Interestingly, it has been reported that 20–80% of children with NAFLD can be presented and associated with hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypercholesterolemia [32,33]. In particular, the prevalence of NAFLD increases in hyperglycemic patients, and insulin resistance is more severe in individuals with NASH, than in those with simple steatosis. Our group evaluated a cohort of 120 Italian children (3–18 years) with biopsy-proven NAFLD or NASH for correlations between clinical or biochemical variables and liver histology. Dyslipidemia was largely diagnosed - low HDL cholesterol was found in 45% of the population, and hypertriglyceridemia in 63%. The presence of MS or clinical and biochemical variables associated with the syndrome were strictly related to histological features of NASH. It is well documented that NAFLD can occur in very young children, but it is more prevalent in adolescents [34]. Factors that can explain the higher rate of NAFLD in adolescents include sex hormones and insulin resistance in puberty [35,36], or their increased control over unhealthy food choices and sedentary lifestyle [37]. It is more common in boys than in girls [35] with a male to female ratio of 2:1. It is possible to hypothesize that estrogens can be potentially liver-protective; or indicate that androgens may aggravate NASH [38,39]. Ethnicity can also affect the prevalence of NAFLD and has been consistently investigated across studies involving largely multiethnic populations. NAFLD is more common in Hispanic than in Caucasian children [20,35,40]. Ethnic differences could possibly be due to higher rates of insulin resistance, and to visceral adiposity at equivalent body mass index (BMI), but also as a result of socio-economic factors, including type of diet, exercise choice and living location. Despite the fact that African- American children often present more risk factors for NAFLD—including obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus—the rate of NAFLD in these individuals is lower [41]. It is an area of intense research.Histopathological pattern and New scoring systems The pattern of the distribution of pediatric NAFLD histological lesions is frequently different from that of adults. Classical histological findings that characterize NAFLD in children are: steatosis, ballooning, inflammation and fibrosis [7]. These features have been deeply characterized elsewhere [13]. Evidence of steatosis in >5% of hepatocytes is the necessary criterion for diagnosing NAFLD both in adults and children [42]. Steatosis distribution is the first distinctive feature between adult and pediatric NAFLD. In adults, steatosis starts in the perivenular zone (acinar zone 3), whereas in children, it typically starts in the periportal zone (acinar zone 1) or shows azonal distribution. The reason why these 2 different patterns are described as such is still unknown [43,44]. Inflammatory infiltrate (including lymphocytes, histiocytes or Kupffer cells) can be present in lobules or in portal tracts of the liver [7]. Hepatocyte ballooning is a major distinguishing feature of NASH that confers an increased risk of disease progression [45]. The importance of ballooning has been emphasized by the results of the two largest randomized trials for NAFLD treatment in adults and children, namely The TONIC and The PIVENS trial [46,47]. Fibrosis of the liver occurs as a response to the insult of NASH. As for steatosis, in children, the fibrosis pattern is prevalent in zone 1. In 2005, Schwimmer et al. [48] categorized two prevalent patterns of NASH in children: the ‘adult type’, in which steatosis has a zonal distribution prevalent in zone 3, and is associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and perisinusoidal fibrosis; and the ‘pediatric type’, in which steatosis is associated with portal inflammation and portal fibrosis in the absence of ballooning. Other studies have more recently found that these patterns can overlap in variable degrees of combination [49]. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) Pathology Committee introduced, above the categories of ‘not-NASH’ and ‘definite-NASH’, the categories of ‘borderline zone 1 pattern’, to describe a NASH type with prevalent portal alteration, and of ‘borderline zone 3 pattern’ in cases of prevalent alterations in zone 3. The zone 1 NASH pattern is often seen in children [49]. A hypothesis that may explain the heterogeneity in histology patterns of pediatric NASH is that the ongoing pathology may start in zone 1, and result in the adult pattern later in its natural history. Alternatively, pediatric NASH could be a distinct pathology from adult NASH. Further investigations are needed to carefully characterize the disease in children. Currently, two main scoring systems exist to evaluate histological activity in NAFLD and NASH, and are used both in children and adults. The Brunt score [50], based on the semi-quantitative assessment of macrovacuolar steatosis, ballooning, lobular and portal inflammation, generates three-tier grades of activity: mild or grade 1; moderate or grade 2; severe or grade 3. The other scoring system is the NASH–CRN system [51], that generates a numeric score for grading the disease, the so-called NAFLD activity score (NAS). NAS results from adding together the individual scores for steatosis (0–3), lobular inflammation (0–3), and ballooning (0–2), range from 0 to 8. A NAS score of 1 and 2 corresponds to ‘not NASH’, whilst a score >5 corresponds to ‘definite-NASH’. Activity scores 3 and 4 are the borderline cases. Both scoring systems generate a numeric score for staging fibrosis: stage 1 (perisinusoidal fibrosis); stage 2 (portal–periportal fibrosis); stage 3 (bridging fibrosis); and stage 4 (cirrhosis). Since the development of the original NAS score, it has soon become evident that classifying pediatric NASH with its distinct histopathological pattern, mainly characterized by the presence of portal-based disease, including portal inflammation (PI), was particularly difficult. As a matter of fact, using a NAS score, only about half of all children could be categorized into a clear cut pattern, while the other half fell into the “borderline” category, supporting the need for a more reproducible scoring system to interpret liver histology in pediatric cases of NAFLD/NASH. Therefore, our group studied 203 consecutive children [52], with biopsy–proven NAFLD, aiming to develop a new grading of a ‘specific score’ for Pediatric NAFLD, to be used in clinical trials, which took into account the presence of PI. This score was called the Pediatric NAFLD Histological Score (PNHS). Histological features were scored: steatosis (0–3), lobular inflammation (0–3), ballooning (0–2), and PI (0–2). Our results demonstrated that there was an excellent correlation between PNHS scores and the presence of NASH, suggesting that this ‘specific score’ might be considered to be used for the histological grading of pediatric NAFLD.Pathogenesis: present and future perspectives NAFLD occurs in overweight and obese children, in whom the energetic balance, normally based on the perfect equality of income, waste and storage has failed. Multiple factors are probably involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms. All together they create a network of interactions participating in both the development and progression of the disease [13,14], that has been summarized over a decade ago by Day et al. in the so called “two hits hypothesis” (Figure 1). The “first hit” is represented by peripheral insulin resistance, leading to fat accumulation in hepatocytes, and an increased lipid peroxidation. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, accompanying obesity, lead to liver steatosis, since they increase the absolute free-fatty-acids (FFA) uptake in the liver, the esterification of hepatic FFAs to form triglycerides (TG), the FFA synthesis from cytosolic substrates, and the decreased apolipoprotein B-100 synthesis. Subsequently, the export of FFA and TG is decreased, while the beta-oxidation of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acids is increased. The “second hit” is represented by oxidative stress, which seems to explain the progression to liver fibrosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can induce hepatocellular injury by the inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, the inactivation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the inactivation of membrane sodium channels. ROS further cause lipid peroxidation, cytokine production, and induce Fas Ligand, contributing to hepatocellular injury and fibrosis. To summarize, the first step consists of the intrahepatic accumulation of fatty acids, which is closely associated with insulin resistance, and which increases the susceptibility of hepatocytes to secondary injuries or insults (oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, overproduction and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the endotoxin-mediated activation of the innate immune response). Increased susceptibility to these factors might also explain the progression of NAFLD to NASH [53,54].Figure 1 The “two hits” hypothesis. Transformation from NAFLD to NASH can be explained by the so called “two hit” hypothesis. The “first hit consists of the intrahepatic accumulation of fatty acids, which is closely associated with insulin resistance, and which increases the susceptibility of hepatocytes to secondary injuries or insults (oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, overproduction and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the endotoxin-mediated activation of the innate immune response). Visceral adipose tissue is believed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, since it participates in producing most adipokines, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), resistin, and adiponectin, which are involved in inducing insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation. As a matter of fact, several current therapeutic approaches aim at reducing visceral adipocyte-derived adipokine and FFA overflow to the liver, by weight loss and insulin-sensitizers. Leptin is a satiety adipokine produced predominantly in adipocytes [55] that regulates appetite and metabolism at the level of the hypothalamus [56]. Most obese humans have high circulating levels of leptin, as a result of what has been characterized as leptin resistance. This phenomenon of leptin resistance may already be present in obese children [57-59]. Adiponectin is an adipose-specific hormone that has anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties [60,61]. Similar to adult data, observational pediatric studies have shown an inverse correlation between plasma adiponectin concentrations and adiposity, insulin resistance [62] and hepatic fat [63]. It is promising that adiponectin is favorably modifiable by simple lifestyle changes, and using the levels of total adiponectin, or high-molecular-weight, adiponectin as a biomarker for insulin sensitivity is gaining support. Resistin is another adipokine that antagonizes insulin action, causing glucose intolerance [64] – resistin-deficient animals are protected from obesity – whereas elevated resistin is associated with insulin resistance [65]. Both TNF-alpha and IL-6 are positively related to adiposity, and correlate with insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors [66,67]. They also indirectly mediate lipolysis and augment hepatic synthesis of fatty acids. Studies on the effect of therapies on inflammatory factors are still limited, except for a few studies on IL-6 and TNF-alpha [68-70]. Further interventional trials are awaited to clarify the link among adipokines, NAFLD, MS and CVD.Genetic predisposition Evidence that only a minority of patients with NAFLD progress to NASH suggests that disease progression is likely to depend on complex interplay between environmental factors and genetic predisposition. The pathogenesis of NAFLD appears to be multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Two recent cohort studies and one community-based study in different ethnicities estimated that the heritability of NAFLD could approach 35–40% of the total predisposition, even after adjusting for age, gender, race and BMI [71,72]. Several genetic variants in the genes involved in energy balance, such as adiponutrin/patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3), and apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3), or in genes involved in inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrogenesis, such as SOD2, have been demonstrated to be associated with NAFLD and the severity of liver damage. The association of the PNPLA3 variant with NAFLD in obese children and adolescents has been deeply characterized. Similarly to obese adults, the PNPLA3 variant confers genetic susceptibility to liver damage as identified by increased ALT and AST liver enzyme levels in young patients. There was no relationship of the PNPLA3 variant with insulin sensitivity, BMI or serum triglycerides, but a close relationship was demonstrated between the PNPLA3 variant and the increased central obesity in obese children, as determined by waist circumference, which contributes to liver damage in children with NAFLD [73]. Since accumulating evidence had suggested the involvement of the endocannabinoid-system in liver disease and related complications, our group [74] has recently studied the hepatoprotective properties for Cannabinoid Receptor type 2 (CB2) in a cohort of 118 obese Italian children with biopsy proven NAFLD. We have found that whereas the CB2 Q63R variant was not associated with steatosis or fibrosis, it was associated with the severity of the inflammation (P = 0.002), and the presence of NASH (P = 0.02), suggesting a critical role for the CB2 Q63R variant in modulating the hepatic inflammation state in obese children, and in the consequent increased predisposition of these patients to develop liver damage. Several ongoing studies on the genetic predisposition for NAFLD, by different research groups, will certainly and soon help in the identification of new molecular targets for the pharmacological treatment of NAFLD.Diagnosis A recent position paper by the ESPGHAN hepatology committee [75] has clarified the diagnostic approach to NAFLD in childhood, describing the role of different tests, including liver biopsy. NAFLD is more frequent in children aged more than 10 years, and is usually present with overweight/obesity. The diagnosis of NAFLD needs the recognition of fatty liver, and the exclusion of other causes of steatosis. Liver biopsy is the current gold standard for the diagnosis of NAFLD, and it is the only way to distinguish between NASH and simple steatosis, and to determine the severity of liver damage and the presence and extent of fibrosis, as well as to rule out other diagnoses such as autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease and metabolic diseases [76]. However, since liver biopsy is an invasive procedure, it is usually not performed as a first step. Primary noninvasive evaluation (biochemical parameters, imaging tests and serum biomarkers) should be used as initial tools to confirm the diagnosis of fatty liver disease, especially in the typical patient with characteristics of MS. The current diagnostic laboratory workup used for the diagnosis of pediatric NAFLD is discussed in Table  1.Table 1 Laboratory work up in suspected pediatric NAFLDLaboratory workupWhat to rule outBasic profile: Full blood count, Liver function tests, fasting glucose and insulin, urea and electrolytes, coagulation, INR, iron, ferritin, uric acid Lipid profileDyslipidemia/Familial hypercholesterolemia/ Cholesterol ester storage diseaseLipoproteinsAbetalipoproteinaemiaGlucose tolerance test (OGTT), glycosylated hemoglobinInsulin resistance/Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2)Thyroid function testsHypothyroidismCeruloplasmin levelWilson DiseaseViral hepatitis panelViral - hepatitis (HBV, HCV)C-Reactive-Protein + consider EBV, CMV immune state profileAcute systemic diseaseSweat testCystic FybrosisAnti-Transglutaminase IgA and total IgACoeliac diseaseCPKMuscular DystrophyAlpha-1-antitrypsin serum levelAlpha-1-antitrypsin deficiencySerum lactate +/− amino and organic acids +/− plasma-free fatty acids +/− acyl carnitine profileMetabolic diseases (Galactosaemia -in infants-, hereditary fructose intolerance, glycogen storage disease (Type VI and IX), othersSerum Immuniglobulin, Liver autoantibodiesAutoimmune hepatitisSpecific tests as suggested by history, consider:Drug toxicity, Parenteral Nutrition, Protein malnutrition, others Laboratory tests in suspected pediatric NAFLD, and correspondent ruled out diseases of other etiology. Liver function blood tests and imaging techniques (US, CT, MRI) are commonly used as indirect markers of liver steatosis. None of these have proven to be reliable, and the sensitivity and the specificity are undetermined. Aminotransferases are used, together with the measurement of accessible serum parameters such as glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, lipoproteins, glucose/insulin levels after tolerance tests, and glycated hemoglobin HbA1c (Table  1), to assess NAFLD diagnosis and to screen children from possible hepatopathy-related metabolic complications, such as MS. These measurements must be combined with the evaluation of anthropometric parameters – BMI, abdominal circumference – and with other information such as the patient’s gender and the health state and lifestyle of the relatives. Generally, the AST: ALT ratio is less than 1, but this value can increase as fibrosis progresses. Circulating levels of aminotransferases can fluctuate over time and are normal (<0.67 μkat/l) in a large number of children with NAFLD and NASH [77,78]. Normal levels of serum aminotransferases do not exclude the presence of fibrosis or even cirrhosis. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and GGT can also be slightly elevated in pediatric NAFLD. Moreover, positive antinuclear antibody and smooth muscle antibody (SMA) titers can be found in 15.4%, and in 10% of patients, respectively. Positive autoantibodies have been associated with the higher fibrosis stages [79]. Since patients with NAFLD are often present with some components of MS, lipid profiles, as well as fasting glucose and insulin levels, should always be verified [80]. Albumin, bilirubin, and platelet serum levels are usually normal unless the patient is developing cirrhosis. Identifying and validating potential novel noninvasive biomarkers of NAFLD and NASH is a central area of research. The pediatric NAFLD fibrosis index (PNFI), which is obtained from three simple measurements—age, waist circumference and triglyceride levels—has been developed to predict liver fibrosis in children with NAFLD [81]. This index is easy to calculate with no additional cost to the patient, and it has a good positive predictive value to predict fibrosis; however, its negative predictive value to rule out fibrosis is suboptimal. These limitations can be overcome when used in a sequential algorithm with the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test, which uses a combination of three extracellular matrix components (namely hyaluronic acid, amino-terminal propeptide of type III collagen and TIMP1), resulting in an accurate assessment of the presence of liver fibrosis in children [82]. Future studies are still needed to externally cross-validate these findings, before the combination of PNFI and ELF can be recommended in children with NAFLD. Some evidence has demonstrated the utility of a measurement of plasma levels of a specific byproduct of apoptosis in liver cells—caspase-generated cytokeratin 18 fragments—in the diagnosis of NASH in adults [83]. In 2010, Fitzpatrick et al.[84] demonstrated that children with biopsy-proven NAFLD also showed considerably elevated levels of these cytokeratin 18 fragments when compared with healthy controls. These results suggest that measuring cytokeratin 18 fragments could be useful in the work-up of children suspected of having NASH. Larger validation studies are, however, still needed.Imaging techniques Liver ultrasonography is the most commonly used imaging diagnostic modality, largely because it is relatively inexpensive, widely available and is user-friendly [85]. Liver ultrasonography can provide a good estimate of the degree, or the extent of hepatic steatosis that is present, based on a series of ultrasonographical characteristics. Shannon and colleagues [86] demonstrated that liver ultrasonography is a useful tool for quantifying steatosis in pediatric patients who have suspected NAFLD; ultrasonography scores strongly correlate with the grade of steatosis when conducting a liver biopsy. Unfortunately, the diagnostic sensitivity of ultrasonography decreases, either when the liver contains <30% of fat, or in individuals with a BMI of 40 or more [87]. Furthermore, ultrasonography cannot rule out the presence of steatohepatitis or fibrosis. Overall the sensitivity of ultrasound in NAFLD ranges from 60% to 94%, with specificity from 84% to 100%. Computed tomography is more specific, but is not used for the screening of fatty liver in obese children for obvious limitations related to radiation exposure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-MRS have the greatest accuracy to determine hepatic fat content, but are rarely used due to the high costs. The Fibroscan® uses transient elastography to evaluate fibrosis. It correlates well with liver fibrosis on histology in studies in both adults and children. In one study conducted by our group, 67 consecutive children and adolescents with NAFLD were studied [88]. Multilevel likelihood ratios were used to explore the whole spectrum of transient elastography measurements in relation to the degree of fibrosis. We demonstrated that values over 5 kPa could predict the presence of fibrosis. More recently, Fitzpatrick and colleagues [89] have shown that Transient Elastography is a reliable tool in distinguishing different stages of liver fibrosis in paediatric patients, even if it is best performed in children with an autoimmune liver disease, and in those post-transplant, than in those with NAFLD with whom fibrosis had to be excluded. Therefore, Fibroscan® can be useful, but it is not yet sufficient enough in non-invasively monitoring the liver disease progression in children. To summarize, as shown in Table  1, the differential diagnosis of NAFLD should be based first on clinical features, then on noninvasive tests, and finally on liver biopsy. Other causes of chronic liver disease including hepatitis B and C, Wilson disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, cystic fibrosis and drug toxicity, and should always be excluded. Alcohol abuse must always be questioned. Especially in young children (less than 3 years), a detailed diagnosis for metabolic causes of fatty infiltrations in the liver should be performed (Table  1).Prevention and treatment Because of the limited knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of NAFLD, the current therapeutic modalities consist of strategies aimed at decreasing the incidence of the known risk factors. Interventions including community involvement are useful in improving health at individual and public health level. Prevention and control of modifiable risk factors as overweight and unhealthy lifestyle, along with primordial prevention by good pregnancy care -for prevention of low birth weight- and encouraging breast feeding, can impact the overall health of children and adolescents as well as the prevention and control of pediatric NAFLD and the related metabolic syndrome. The few existing therapeutic strategies are typically not based on drugs, and currently there is no treatment targeting the disease per se. Lifestyle changes and pharmacological treatment have been deeply discussed elsewhere [90]. However, several international groups, based on new pathogenetic paradigms, have recently launched novel clinical trials, combining non-pharmacologic and pharmacological approaches, in an innovative multi-targeted plan. Therapies that simultaneously target the clinical features of NAFLD and NASH (such as dietary interventions to reduce obesity) and molecular mechanisms (such as agents that are effective against the secondary injuries or insults as described above) could be employed. We seriously consider that multi-targeted therapy could be the way forward for treating these children (Figure 2). Such therapy consists of combinations of the therapeutic approaches directed against various potential targets. Recently, interesting dietary supplements such as probiotics and long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been adopted in adults with NAFLD [91,92]. Interestingly, these dietary supplements, although considered pharmacological interventions, are often based on natural compounds present in specific foods (yogurt, fish oil, etc.). Among the pathogenetic factors leading to NAFLD, the persistent crosstalk among the gut, the immune system, and the liver, plays a pivotal role [93]. In fact, it is now accepted that specific nutrients increase the intestinal permeability to bacterial endotoxins, activating an immune-mediated inflammatory response of liver resident cells, leading to a profibrogenic phenotype [94]. One recent study on animal models [95], has demonstrated a pivotal role of restoring gut microflora in protecting the liver from fat and preventing cardiovascular disease. As demonstrated in genetic animal models with dyslipidemia, low grade intestinal inflammation can drive steatosis to steatohepatitis. Performing an intervention on intestinal microbiota using probiotics can modulate the expression of nuclear receptors, correcting insulin resistance in the liver and the adipose tissues and protecting against the development of steatohepatitis. Randomized placebo controlled trials on the use of probiotics in NAFLD are ongoing in humans.Figure 2 Proposed treatment schedule in pediatric NAFLD. Multi-targeted therapy could be the way forward for treating children with NAFLD. Such therapy consists of combinations of the therapeutic approaches directed against various potential targets added to intervention on lifestyle and diet. Psychological therapies could improve adherence to therapies. Furthermore, studies in experimental models have shown that long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, known as important regulators of hepatic gene transcription, can decrease liver steatosis, improve insulin sensitivity, and decrease markers of inflammation [92]. Recently, Nobili et al. [96] reported the results of a randomized clinical trial based on the use of an omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid. A 6-months docosahexaenoic acid supplementation to the diet, together with physical exercise, ameliorated the body mass index, the insulin sensitivity index, serum ALT and triacylglycerol levels, and steatosis at ultrasound.Review In several recently published works, in large cohorts of overweight and obese children and adolescents from both the western and eastern worlds, NAFLD has emerged to be extremely prevalent and predicted by obesity and male gender. This data underlines the epidemiological dimension of this obesity-related morbidity, even in childhood, inducing one to recommend at least ALT as a screening parameter in basic care. Once NAFLD is diagnosed, it is nowadays compulsory to prescribe lifestyle changes and dietary interventions to reduce pediatric obesity, but also to consider new treatment approaches that simultaneously target the clinical features and i) the molecular mechanisms (such as agents that are effective against the secondary injuries or insults) ii) the crosstalk among the gut, the immune system, and the liver, in view of the so called NAFLD multi-targeted therapy.Conclusions An early recognition of NAFLD may help when intervening at a younger age, which may reduce future morbidity and mortality from the disease. As a matter of fact, the effects of a modern low-cost diet (with high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, energy-dense and micronutrient-poor foods) will make children experience, in the next 10–20 years, the highest incidence of an “obesity epidemic” and obesity-related diseases. This has prompted a new sense of urgency, to find novel and early prevention strategies during childhood, to start an efficient primary prevention process.Abbreviations (NAFLD): Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; (NASH): Non-alcoholic steatohepatatis; (AST): Aspartate amino¬transferase; (ALT): Alanine aminotransferase; (BMI): Body mass index; (MS): Metabolic syndrome; (FFA): Free-fatty-acids; (TG): Triglycerides; (ROS): Reactive oxygen species; (TNF-alpha): Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha; (CVD): Cardiovascular disease; (PNPLA3): Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3; (APOC3): Apolipoprotein C3; (CB2): Cannabinoid Receptor type 2; (SMA): Smooth muscle antibody; (PNFI): Pediatric NAFLD fibrosis index; (ELF): Enhanced liver fibrosis.Competing interest The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors’ contributions VG – performed literature searching, wrote the first draft of manuscript with table and figures.

The insect short neuropeptide F (sNPF) peptides, related to the vertebrate neuropeptide Y (NPY) peptides, have been implicated in the regulation of food intake and body size, and play a gonadotropic role in the ovaries of some insect species. Recently the sNPF peptides were localized in the brain of larval and adult . However, the location of the sNPF receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), has not yet been investigated in brains of any adult insect. To elucidate the sites of action of the sNPF peptide(s), the sNPF receptor tissue expression and cellular localization were analyzed in queens of the red imported fire ant, Buren (Hymenoptera), an invasive social insect. In the queen brains and subesophageal ganglion about 164 cells distributed in distinctive cell clusters (C1-C9 and C12) or as individual cells (C10, C11) were immuno-positive for the sNPF receptor. Most of these neurons are located in or near important sensory neuropils including the mushroom bodies, the antennal lobes, the central complex, and in different parts of the protocerebrum, as well as in the subesophageal ganglion. The localization of the sNPF receptor broadly links the receptor signaling pathway with circuits regulating learning and feeding behaviors. In ovaries from mated queens, the detection of sNPF receptor signal at the posterior end of oocytes in mid-oogenesis stage suggests that the sNPF signaling pathway may regulate processes at the oocyte pole. The analysis of sNPF receptor immunolocalization shows that the sNPF signaling cascade may be involved in diverse functions, and the sNPF peptide(s) may act in the brain as neurotransmitter(s) or neuromodulator(s), and in the ovaries as neurohormone(s). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cellular localization of a sNPF receptor on the brain and ovaries of adult insects.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cellular localization of a sNPF receptor on the brain and ovaries of adult insects. Background Information processing through neuronal networks in the central nervous system (CNS) is achieved through the release of neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators from presynaptic neurons and the receiving of those signaling molecules by their respective receptors in the postsynaptic neurons. Additionally, the released neuromodulators can also diffuse and reach out to receptors located at nonsynaptic regions within the CNS. Neuropeptides are a complex group of signaling molecules which can act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators within the CNS, and as circulating neurohormones in the hemolymph. In this way, neuropeptides influence numerous physiological processes in invertebrates [1]. Neuropeptides in the neuropeptide F (NPF) family have been identified in, or predicted from genomes of a broad range of invertebrate taxa, including insects; however, only few of the respective G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been identified or fully characterized [2-15]. Therefore, this study focuses on the immunolocalization of a short neuropeptide F (sNPF) receptor in the queen of the red important fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Invertebrate NPF family neuropeptides are structurally and functionally related to the vertebrate neuropeptide Y (NPY) peptide family, which is involved in the regulation of feeding behavior, stress and obesity, blood pressure, anxiety, memory retention, and circadian rhythms [16-18]. The insect NPF family includes long and short NPF peptides [19]. The long NPF (referred to as "NPF") peptides range in size from 36 to 40 amino acid residues and the short NPF (sNPF) peptides range in size from 6 to 11 amino acid residues. Many studies on the long NPF signaling pathway concluded that it is involved in feeding and social behaviors, stress responses, and alcohol sedation sensitivity in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster [20-28], hindgut contraction in the blood-sucking bug Rhodnius prolixus [29], and in ovarian maturation in locusts [30]. In contrast, little information was available on the role of the sNPF signaling pathway until recent studies with Drosophila. Four Drosophila sNPF peptides (sNPF-1 to -4) are generated from the same sNPF precursor by enzymatic processing and modification. This sNPF peptide precursor was detected in about a thousand neurons in the CNS of 3rd instar larvae, and in about five thousand neurons in the CNS of adults [1,31]. Drosophila gain-of-function mutants with sNPF overexpression in the nervous system display increased food intake, resulting in flies larger than the wild type, while loss-of-function mutants exhibit reduced food intake [32]. Further experiments have shown that the receptor for sNPF peptides, located in the insulin-producing median neurosecretory cells in Drosophila larvae brain, is the upstream regulator that controls the expression of insulin-like peptides through the activation of extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK) [33,34]. In other insects, sNPF signaling pathways also appear to be involved in feeding regulation. For example, in the fire ants, the sNPF receptor transcripts in the queen brain were decreased by starvation suggesting that the sNPF signaling cascade may play a role in feeding regulation [11]. Moreover, during diapause, the adult Colorado beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) is devoid of sNPFs suggesting that the sNPFs might contribute to pre-diapause shifts in feeding behavior that lead to larger body size and reserve accumulation [35]. In the honey bee Apis mellifera, the sNPF and its receptor transcript expression levels were interpreted as associated with worker division of labor and feeding behavior [36,37]. The sNPF receptor transcript is up-regulated in brains of foragers under food-deprivation (without protein) suggesting that foragers are more sensitive to nutritional changes than nurses [37]. The sNPF signaling pathway appears to be involved in additional insect functions. For instance, the Colorado potato beetle sNPF peptide, Led-NPF-1, was shown to stimulate ovarian development in the locust Locusta migratoria, suggesting a potential gonadotropin role of the peptide [19,38]; however, it is not known if this is the peptide direct effect. Functions such as cardio-inhibitory activity on beetles [39], and an increase in locomotor behavior and the modulation of metabolic stress responses in the fruit fly [40,41] have also been discovered. In Drosophila, the diversity in the function of the sNPF pathway might be explained by the broad and abundant distribution of sNPF peptides discovered in the brain. In addition, the sNPF peptides have also been identified in the hemolymph of adult Drosophila, suggesting a potential neuroendocrine role [42]. However, the exact targets of the sNPF peptide in the adult insect CNS or other tissues are still unknown. The sNPF receptor belongs to the GPCR Rhodopsin family and is an orthologue gene of the vertebrate NPY type 2 (Y2) receptor [43]. Insect sNPF receptors have been characterized from S. invicta, D. melanogaster, and the mosquito Anopheles gambiae [11,14,43,44]. Ligand-receptor binding assays of sNPF receptors from D. melanogaster and A. gambiae revealed that sNPF peptides that contain nine or more amino acids are more potent than those with eight or fewer amino acids [14,42,44,45]. An. gambiae sNPF-1 inhibited the production of forskolin-stimulated cAMP by sNPF receptor transfected cells, suggesting that the receptor may act via Gi/o signal pathway [14]. The fire ant sNPF receptor transcript is present in the brain, midgut, hindgut, Malpighian tubules, fat body, and ovaries of mated queens, as determined by RT-PCR; a particularly high level of receptor expression was detected in the brain [11]. The Drosophila sNPF receptor transcript is present in both central and peripheral nervous systems in larvae and adults [43,44]. The An. gambiae sNPF receptor transcript is also broadly expressed in different body parts, but the receptor protein is not detectable in the ovaries by western blot [14]. Studies in these three insect species clearly showed that sNPF receptor transcripts are expressed in different tissues. However, because of the presence of the sNPF receptor in the nervous system, the RT-PCR results for peripheral tissues shown in fire ants and Drosophila are not definitive to establish receptor tissue localization because the amplification could potentially arise from neuronal contamination. In addition, transcript presence may not be associated with receptor protein expression. Therefore, localization of the sNPF receptor is an important step in defining the functional sites of the sNPF. Importantly, to our knowledge, there is currently no report on sNPF receptor protein localization in the adult brain or ovaries of any insect, and the role of sNPF in ovarian development is still unknown. The only report is from Drosophila larvae brain in which the receptor protein is immunolocalized in a few median neurosecretory cells [33]. In the past five years, much effort has been made to characterize receptors for neuropeptides; however, there is still relatively little information regarding their distribution and function, and only a few receptors have been successfully localized in certain tissues using immunolabeling, or particularly in Drosophila by using transgenic flies (for reviews, see [1,12]). The role of the sNPF signaling pathway in essential physiological processes makes it an important subject for study in social insects, especially ants, in which the control of both feeding and reproduction is complex and poorly understood. To elucidate the role of sNPF signaling pathway in fire ants, we investigated the localization of the sNPF receptor in both the brain and the ovaries of queens. We present evidence that the sNPF peptide(s) not only function as neurotransmitter(s) or neuromodulator(s) within the brain, but also might act as neurohormone(s) targeting the ovaries.ResultsExpression of sNPF receptor in both brain and ovaries of fire ant queens To demonstrate the specificity of the antibodies developed against the fire ant sNPF receptor, we first performed western blot analyses of membrane proteins of queen brains, postpharyngeal glands, and ovaries (Figure 1). In the membrane proteins from brains of virgin queens, only one band was specifically recognized by the anti-sNPF receptor antibodies (Figure 1, A, lane 1). The estimated molecular weight (Mw) of the sNPF receptor band was ~46.2 kDa, corresponding to the predicted receptor Mw of 44.8 kDa. No signal was detected using antigen-preabsorbed antibodies, as expected (Figure 1, A, lane 3). Similar receptor expression levels were observed in the brains of virgin and mated queens (Figure 1, B, lanes 1 and 2). The postpharyngeal gland in the head of fire ant queen, which occupies a large portion of the head overlaying the brain, was used as a negative control tissue. No signal was detected using either anti-sNPF receptor antibodies (Figure 1, A, lane 2) or antigen-preabsorbed antibodies (Figure 1, A, lane 4), as expected. In the ovaries, three putative sNPF receptor bands (~46.2-, 51.1- and 55.3- kDa) were detected in the mated queen (Figure 1, B, lane 4), but not in the ovaries of virgin queens (Figure 1, B, lane 3). These different size bands in the mated queen ovaries are likely due to different post-translational modifications (including phosphorylation and N-glycosylation) predicted in the fire ant sNPF receptor protein sequence [11].Figure 1 Western blot analyses of the sNPF receptor expression in membranes from queens. A: Membrane preparations (100 μg of protein per lane) of brains and subesophageal ganglion (SEG) (lanes 1 and 3, labeled with B) and postpharyngeal glands (lanes 2 and 4, labeled with PG) were analyzed with anti-sNPF receptor antibodies (lanes 1 and 2) or with antigen-preabsorbed antibodies (lanes 3 and 4). Only one band (~46.2 kDa) was specifically recognized in the membranes by the anti-sNPF receptor antibodies (lane 1, arrow), and no signal was detected using antigen-preabsorbed antibodies, as was expected (lane 3). No signal was detected in the membrane proteins from the postpharyngeal glands (lanes 2 and 4). B: Membrane proteins from brains and SEG (100 μg, lane 1 and 2) and ovaries (50 μg, lanes 3 and 4) of virgin queens (VQ) and mated queens (MQ) were also analyzed with anti-sNPF receptor antibodies. Similar receptor bands (~46.2 kDa) were detected in the membrane preparations of virgin and mated queens (lanes 1 and 2, arrow). The same size band (arrow) was also detected in mated queen ovaries (lane 4), but not in those of virgin queens (lane 3). In addition, two putative receptor bands (~55.3- and 51.1-kDa, lane 4, arrowheads) were detected in the mated queen ovaries but not in those of virgin queen ovaries (lane 3). M, marker.Distribution of the sNPF receptor in the brains of fire ant queens In the virgin queen brains and the subesophageal ganglion (SEG), about 164 cells distributed in distinctive cell clusters (C1-C9 and C12) or present as individual cells (C10, C11) were immunolabeled with sNPF receptor antibodies. These cells or clusters were named as C1 to C12, clockwise, beginning from the mid-superior line in the anterior brain view and continuing to the posterior view of brain and the SEG. Clusters C1 to C6 (Figure 2, A) are thus readily seen in the anterior view during brain whole mounts examination, and C7 to C12 (Figure 2, B) are seen in the posterior view while C5, C9 and C12 can also be seen dorsally (Figure 2, C and 2D). Except clusters C1, C6 and C12 which are located centrally, other clusters or cells were bilaterally symmetrical. Most of these neurons are located in or near the important sensory neuropils. Strong sNPF receptor signals were observed in clusters C2, C3, and C12. Three different sizes of cell bodies, small (cells ~5 μm), intermediate (cells ~5-10 μm), and large (cells ~12 μm), were detected with sNPF receptor antibodies. The C6 cluster only contained small cells and C5 contained two large cells and one intermediate size cell, while C10-C12 cells were exclusively large. The rest of the immunostained cells in other clusters were of intermediate size. We did not observe different receptor distribution in the brains of virgin and mated queens. Therefore, results shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 are only from virgin queens. All subsequent brain images in Figures 3, 4, 5 show anterior or posterior brain views with the dorsal side up, unless otherwise mentioned.Figure 2 Summary of the immunolocalization of the sNPF receptor in the queen brain and SEG. A total of ~164 cells (shown as red dots) distributed in cell clusters (C1-C9 and C12) or as individual cells (C10, C11) were identified.

Cluster C1 (cells ~5-10 μm) included three unpaired cells located in the superior medial protocerebrum (Figure 3, A-D). Cluster C2 (cells ~5-10 μm) is represented by two groups of ~25 cells each, which are located near the lateral calyces (lCa) of the mushroom bodies in the superior protocerebrum (Figure 3, E-L). These cells surrounded the anterior half-side of the lateral pedunculi (lPed) that connects to the lCa (Figure 3, E-H). Out of 25 cells in the cluster C2, seven cells that are located closer to the anterior surface of the lCa are likely to be the lateral neurosecretory cells (Figure 3, E-L, arrowheads). The cluster C7 also is detected in the stacked confocal images (Figure 3, F-G) obtained from the anterior view and will be described further in Figure 5 because it is more clearly visible from the posterior side of the brain. C3 cells are represented by two groups of eight cells each (cells ~5-10 μm), symmetrically located in the superior protocerebrum (Figure 4, A and 4B). Two groups of six cells (cells ~5-10 μm) named cluster C4 were observed symmetrically located in the anterior protocerebrum, extending vertically between clusters C3 and C5 (Figure 4, D and 4E). Cluster C5 contained three cells horizontally aligned on the superior edge of antennal lobe (Figure 4, E and 4F); stronger signals were detected in the two larger cells. The last cluster of cells observed from the anterior side of the brain was C6 which was composed of a group of ~30 small cells (cells ~5 μm). These cells were centrally located in the inferior medial protocerebrum, right above the esophageal foramen, near the end of the mushroom body median lobe (Figure 4, G and 4H). C7 to C12 were visible in the posterior side of the brain and SEG (Figure 5). Some cells belonging to the anterior cluster C2 that are located between lCa and medial calyces (mCa) were also visible from the posterior side of the brain (Figure 5, A-C). Cluster C7 (cells ~5-10 μm) includes two groups of four cells symmetrically located above the central complex in the superior medial protocerebrum (Figure 5, D); this brain area is also named the pars intercerebralis in the honey bee. Two groups of about 11 cells (cells ~5-10 μm), each in the superior protocerebrum right below the mCa of the mushroom bodies were named cluster C8 (Figure 5, E and 5F). Cluster C9 (cells ~5-10 μm) includes two groups of 4 cells each located in the inferior lateral protocerebrum; these are likely optical projection neurons (Figure 5, G). In the posterior SEG, large cells (~12 μm) named C10, C11, and C12 were strongly immunolabeled with the anti-sNPF receptor antibodies (Figure 5, H-L). C10 and C11 are represented each by a single cell on each side of the SEG and cluster C12 is centrally located and includes 5 cells.The localization of the sNPF receptors in the ovaries of fire ant queens To discover the possible neurohormone role of the fire ant sNPF peptide(s), we performed the immunolocalization of the sNPF receptor in the ovaries of virgin and mated queens (Figure 6). In the ovaries of both mated queens within a colony (Figure 6, A, arrow) and newly mated queens 24 h after the mating flight (Figure 6, B and 6C, arrows), sNPF receptor signals were detected in the posterior end of oocytes at the mid-oogenesis stage. Results clearly showed that the receptor signals localized in the oocyte membrane, and not in the membrane of follicle cells (Figure 6, C). Such signal was not detected in late-oogenesis stage oocytes in which the nurse cells within the same follicle start to shrink in size (Figure 6, A: F1 and F2, big stars). Mated queens within the colony have more mature eggs in each ovariole than newly-mated queens; therefore, the position of the oocytes with receptor signals depended upon the status of ovary development. The receptor signals were also detected in the early-oogenesis stage oocytes (oocyte size < 20 μm) of the mated (Figure 6, D) and virgin queens (Figure 6, E). Notice that the signal is present in the periphery of the oocytes. No signal was detected using either antigen-preabsorbed antibodies (Figure 6, F and 6G) or a preimmune antiserum (Figure 6, H), as expected. This result supports the function of the sNPF pathway in stimulating oocyte development in addition to roles in the modulation of metabolism, growth, and feeding. To our knowledge, this is the first report that a GPCR may be associated with the oocyte pole.Figure 6 The immunolocalization analyses of the sNPF receptor in the ovaries of fire ant queens. Receptor signal was observed in mid- and early-oogenesis oocytes. A: In mated queens in a colony, the sNPF receptor signal was detected in the posterior end of oocytes at the mid-oogenesis stage (arrow, oocyte in follicle number three), but not in oocytes at the late-oogenesis stage in which nurse cells are reduced in size (big stars, oocytes in follicles number 1 and 2). F1, 2 and 3: follicle numbers counted from the calyx (Ca). B: In newly-mated queens (24 h after mating flight), the receptor signals were also detected in a similar stage of developing oocytes as in A. C: A higher magnification merged image of the oocyte posterior end from newly-mated queen ovaries shows a clearly receptor signal (red) in the oocyte membrane, but not in the follicle cells (nuclei in blue, DAPI label). D: The receptor signals were also detected in the early-oogenesis stage oocytes (oocyte size < 20 μm) of mated queens in a colony. E: In virgin queen ovaries, the receptor signals were detected in the early-oogenesis stage oocytes, similar to the mated queen oocytes shown in D. No signal was detected in negative controls using either antigen-preabsorbed antibodies (F and G) or a preimmune antiserum (H).DiscussionOnly one form of the sNPF receptor is present in the brains of fire ant queens Western blot analysis of the fire ant sNPF receptor (Figure 1) showed that only one band at 46.2 kDa was detected in membrane proteins preparations from brains of both virgin and mated queens, corresponding to the predicted receptor Mw of 44.8 kDa [11]. In addition, no differential receptor expression level between virgin and mated queen brains was found, suggesting that receptor abundance in the brains was similar in queens within a colony regardless their insemination status. The only previous study in insects describing the Mw of the sNPF receptor was from the mosquito An. gambiae in which two sNPF receptor bands at 50- and 60- kDa were detected in western blot of heads [14]. The authors indicated that the 60 kDa band might represent either another form of the receptor (because there are three predicted start codons in the receptor open reading frame), or alternatively, a post-translationally modified receptor. Unlike this mosquito, there was no evidence of an alternative start codon in the fire ant sNPF receptor cDNA [11].Expression of the sNPF receptor in diverse regions of queen brains In the queen brain and SEG, we identified a total of ~164 sNPF receptor immunolabeled cells, distributed individually (C10, C11) or in clusters (C1-C9, C12). Most of these cells localized in important sensory neuropils such as the mushroom bodies, the antennal lobes, and the subesophageal ganglia. These results suggest that the sNPF receptor is involved in the widespread modulation of neuronal activity and subsequently may affect various physiological processes and behavioral responses in fire ants. In Drosophila, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry analyses have demonstrated that sNPF transcript or peptide precursor are present in a significant number of neurons in the brain beyond any other neuropeptide found in insects studied so far. In both larvae and adults of Drosophila, sNPF peptide precursor was detected in the mushroom bodies, the subesophageal ganglion, and some neurosecretory cells in each brain hemisphere; in addition, this precursor was also present in the fan-shaped body (a substructure of the central complex), the antennal lobe, a few clock neurons, the optic lobes, the tritocerebral neuropil of the adult brain, as well as in the thoracic-abdominal ganglia of the larvae, and some endocrine cells in the larval midgut [31,32,40,41,46-50]. It was suggested that sNPFs are likely to signal locally (no volume transmission) as co-transmitters because, first, these sNPFnergic neurons do not co-express a transcription factor (DIMM) that is present in most of the neurosecretory cells that release amidated peptides, and secondly, these sNPF neurons co-localized with other neurotransmitters [31,51]. Only a few neurons that co-express both sNPF and DIMM in adult flies are likely to act on target cells located at a distance (volume transmission) [1]. There is a paucity of information on the localization of both sNPF and its receptor in other insect orders. Only recently the expression of the sNPF transcript was analyzed in the honey bee worker brain, and found bilaterally only in a few lateral neurosecretory cells (4-6 pairs). This expression pattern contrasts with the wide distribution of the sNPF in neurons of fruit flies described above. Further, the sNPF peptide has not yet been isolated from fire ants and there is no available sNPF peptide sequence identified from the recently released fire ant draft genome [52]. The lack of a cognate peptide has hampered our attempts to prove sNPF receptor functionality in a heterologous expression system. We have identified sNPF receptor immunolabeled cells distributed in many important sensory neuropils in queen brains suggesting that sNPF peptide function may be more complex and perhaps integrative in fire ant queen brains. However, because our immunolabeling did not stain the terminals of the sNPF receptor-labeled neurons we cannot conclude on the nature of these potential networks. sNPF receptor localization in the protocerebrum of the fire ant brains In the brain of fire ant queens, we detected three unpaired sNPF receptor immunolabeled cells (cluster C1) located in the superior midline protocerebrum (Figure 3, B-D), where the median neurosecretory cells are located in the honey bee brain [53]. In Drosophila larvae, the sNPF receptor was also localized in some of the seven insulin-producing median neurosecretory cells and was verified to act as an upstream regulator of the insulin signaling pathway [33]. In A. aegypti, however, insulin-like peptides were detected in two clusters of lateral neurosecretory cells in the dorsal protocerebrum, but not in median neurosecretory cells [54]. It would be interesting to know if the regulatory role of the sNPF signaling pathway on insulin production in different insects is conserved and thus, to investigate by immunohistochemistry if cells in cluster C1 also produce insulin in fire ant queens. In fire ant queen brains, the majority of the sNPF receptor immunolocalized cells were near the mushroom body. In insects, the mushroom body is the main center for sensory processing, learning and memory, and the integration of other complex behaviors [55]. In Hymenoptera, especially ants, the mushroom bodies are particularly developed and may occupy ~40% of the brain volume [56,57]. The insect brain structure most similar to the fire ant brain is from the honey bee. Both species have large mushroom bodies composed of two calyces (lateral and medial calyces), each with a peduncle which gives rise to median and vertical lobes. The calyx receives input from both the olfactory and visual systems whose neurons synapse with the mushroom body intrinsic neurons, the Kenyon cells. The Kenyon cells consecutively integrate and pass on information within the brain [55]. We have identified several sNPF receptor immunolabeled cells near the mushroom body calyx (clusters C2, C3 and C8) and near the (output) end of the mushroom body median lobe (cluster C6) in the queen brains. Based on the comparison of the location of cluster C2 cells with the position of lateral neurosecretory cells in the brains of honey bees [53], it is possible that some of the C2 cells might belong to lateral neurosecretory cells (Figure 3, E-L, arrowheads). Other neurons in clusters C2 (Figure 3, E-H, arrows) and C8 (Figure 5, E and 5F) were similar in location to the Clawed II Kenyon cells found in the honey bee which are perikarya lying outside the calyx [58,59]. We therefore hypothesize that the sNPF peptide regulates Kenyon cell function in fire ant queens. Cells in the cluster C3 (Figure 4, A-B) between the medium and lateral calyces of the mushroom bodies are tightly group together in the superior protocerebrum, reminiscent in location and aspect to the group 4 FMRFamide-like immunoreactive cells identified in the honey bee brain [60]. The cluster C6 located in the inferior medial protocerebrum is very close to the end of mushroom body median lobe (Figure 4, G and 4H). These C6 cells may represent the targets of axon outputs of sNPFnergic Kenyon cells in the queen brains. In Drosophila, the sNPF peptides are the only neuroactive substance that has been clearly identified in large subpopulations of intrinsic Kenyon cells, and strong sNPF signals are detected in the end (output) of median and vertical lobes in the mushroom bodies [31,48]. However, in fire ant brains, we did not detect other receptor signals near the end of the vertical lobe. This might be due to the largely variant number of Kenyon cells between insect species. For example, in the honey bee each mushroom body has ~170,000 Kenyon cells [61], much more than in Drosophila (~2,500 Kenyon cells) [62]. As a result, the expression of sNPF peptide in the Kenyon cells may also be different between insect orders. The central complex has been proposed as a higher center for locomotor control that regulates several aspects of walking and flying behaviors [63]. The cluster C7 localized above the fan-shaped body of the central complex (Figure 5, D) is located in the same area as the cluster G4d octopaminergic neurons in the honey bee brain [64]. In honey bees, octopamine treatment caused increased flying and reduced walking behaviors [65]. In Drosophila, octopamine is also associated with locomotor behaviors [66]. Interestingly, a recent study showed that Drosophila sNPF peptides expressed in the fan-shaped body of the central complex were associated to the fine tuning of locomotor activity [41]. Female flies with reduced sNPF peptide expression in the fan-shaped body increased their walking distance and their mean walking speed. Thus, the relationship between the sNPF receptor and locomotor activity (which is regulated by sNPF and octopamine in Drosophila or other insects) deserves further investigation in fire ants. If these were related, it will contribute to the understanding of worker foraging behavior, expansion of established colonies and of regulation of queen mating flights. Knowledge of these mechanisms that contribute to colony growth and dispersal may open the possibility of controlling this invasive pest. In the optic lobes, we detected sNPF receptor signals in four cell bodies (cluster C9) in the inferior lateral protocerebrum in the fire ant (Figure 5, G). No other sNPF receptor signal above background staining was obtained in the optic lobe. In the desert ant, Cataglyphis albicans, the optical projection neurons located in the similar inferior lateral protocerebrum region have their dendrites extended to the optic lobes, and their axons projected into the mushroom bodies [67]. Due to the similarity of location, we hypothesize that the C9 sNPF-immunoreactive neurons correspond to the optical projection neurons observed in Cataglyphis albicans. In the brain of adult flies, both the sNPF transcripts and peptides are localized in the optic lobes [31,32].sNPF receptor localization in the antennal lobe of the fire ant brains The antennal lobe is the primary olfactory neuropil. In the antennal lobe, the axons of olfactory receptor neurons from the antennae and the maxillary palps invade into the glomeruli where they synapse with dendrites from interneurons. In queen brains, the cluster C5 cells were horizontally aligned on the superior edge of the antennal lobe. There are two large cells and one intermediate size cell in the cluster C5 (Figure 4, F). It is possible that these C5 cells act in functionally different ways, and belong to different types of interneurons. In insects, three types of interneurons have been distinguished in the antennal lobe: 1) local interneurons that locally interconnect with glomeruli; 2) projection neurons that innervate single or several glomeruli and project axons through antennocerebral tracts into the protocerebrum; 3) centrifugal neurons that are a diverse grouping of neurons with axons projected into the antennal lobe and dendrites reaching to other areas of the nervous system [68]. Cells in the cluster C5 could be local and/or projection interneurons. In Drosophila, the sNPF precursor was immunolabeled in axons of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) projecting from the antennae and the maxillary palps which terminate in 13 glomeruli, with the glomerulus DL3 being particularly strongly stained [49]. It has been shown that the sNPF peptide is involved in the modulation of olfactory processing based on the hunger state of the individual fly [69]. In the fly's anterior dorsal antennal lobes, the projection neurons have their dendrites invade into a subset of glomeruli, including sNPF-labeled glomeruli, and have their axons projected through the inner antennocerebral tract (iACT) to the mushroom body and the lateral horn of the protocerebrum [70]. In the fire ant queens, if sNPF peptide(s) were also expressed in antennal ORNs, it is possible that the chemosensory and olfactory information transmitted through these peptides might be delivered to the projection interneurons in the cluster C5 and be further transmitted for integration to the higher brain centers.sNPF receptor localization in the subesophageal ganglion (SEG) The SEG is the primary center for controlling insect mouth parts. Important modulatory neurons, such as ventral unpaired median (VUM) neurons have their cell bodies in the SEG [71]. In the honey bee, octopaminergic VUM cells innervate the neuropils of the SEG, the mandibulla, the antennal lobes, the mushroom bodies, and some other parts of the brain [72]. The sNPF receptor immunolabeled cells C10, C11, and cluster C12 in the SEG of the fire ant (Figure 5, H-L) were in similar location as the octopaminergic neurons G6b, LV (the lateral ventral), and VUM in the SEG of the honey bee, respectively [64]. In honey bee workers, octopamine modulates diverse behaviors including locomotor activity, dance, division of labor, foraging, hygiene, defense, and nestmate recognition [65,73-80]. In fire ant workers, it was also found that octopamine levels in the brain affect nestmate recognition acuity [81]. However, the function of octopamine in the queen brain of both insects is still unknown. It will be of interest to test if these sNPF receptor immunolabeled cells in the fire ant SEG are involved in regulation of feeding and/or are octopaminergic neurons.The expression of the sNPF receptor in fire ant ovaries Receptors that influence ovarian growth are critical for egg-laying species, as they play a role in oocyte development regulation. Recently some GPCRs involved in meiosis arrest and fertility in vertebrate oocytes were identified [82-85]; yet to our knowledge, no GPCR function has been found associated to the polarity of oocytes in insects. Only few receptors from other receptor superfamilies are involved in the follicle polarity, such as follicle cell-bound EGF receptor involved in the transduction of oocyte anterior/posterior polarity, and Frizzled, involved in the planar polarity signaling [86,87]. In fire ants, the sNPF receptor signal detected in the posterior end of the oocytes during mid-oogenesis from both mated queens (Figure 6, A) and newly-mated queens (Figure 6, B and 6C) opens the possibility that the sNPF receptor may be involved in oocyte polarity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of GPCR that has been found associated with an oocyte pole in insects. We also detected the sNPF receptor signals in the periphery of early-oogenesis stage oocytes from both mated and virgin queens, most likely in the plasma membrane, indicating the sNPF receptor may participate in the regulation of initial oocyte growth (Figure 6, D and 6E). However, we did not detect putative receptor bands in membrane preparations from virgin queen ovaries by western blot (Fig. 1, B, lane 3). This might be due to a limited number of developing oocytes with corresponding low receptor expression levels in the virgin queens which prevented receptor protein detection. In the past we had a similar experience with respect to the lack of detection in western blots from virgin queen ovaries with the antibody against the vitellogenin receptor which labeled the ovaries in immunohistochemistry but failed to detect the protein in western blots (Lu and Pietrantonio, unpublished). In addition, because two weak bands were also detected by western blot in the 60-75 kDa range in both virgin and mated queen ovaries (Fig. 1, B, lanes 3, 4), we are not ruling out the possibility that the fluorescence signals in the early-oogenesis stage oocytes could represent non-specific antibody binding to those two higher size bands. If this is the case, then only the signal in the oocyte posterior end in the mated queen would be specific sNPF receptor signal. Different results on sNPF receptor expression were obtained in the mosquito. In An. gambiae sNPF receptor immunoblot analysis showed that the receptor protein was not detectable in the ovaries of non-blood fed females [14]. Based on our results, we concluded that this might be due to the fact that the females were not blood fed and therefore the ovaries were underdeveloped. In Drosophila, sNPF receptor transcripts were detected in the ovaries of females of unknown age, and the expression level was higher than in the head and body parts [43]. However, in the Flyatlas transcriptome data bank which utilized mRNA from 7 day-old adult fly http://www.flyatlas.org/, the sNPF receptor mRNA level in the ovaries was very low when compared to whole flies [88]. All together, it seems that the level of sNPF receptor protein abundance in the ovaries depends upon the level of the ovary development, mated status, the age of the insects and is perhaps different between solitary and social insects.Conclusions We presented the first comprehensive histochemical analysis of the distribution of the sNPF receptor in the adult insect brain. This knowledge is especially important for research on social insects which display complex social and learning behaviors. The sNPF receptor signals present in several neuropils in fire ant queen brain and SEG might link the receptor signaling pathway to behaviors such as foraging, learning, and food consumption. The localization of the sNPF receptor will allow the testing of the potential regulatory role of this pathway in insulin-producing or octopaminergic cells. In addition, the localization of the sNPF receptor in the developing oocyte points to a direct, potentially novel effect of sNPF on the insect ovary. Still, several questions remain to be answered to fully understand the role of sNPF pathway in neuron circuits, in the endocrine control of reproduction, and in other, yet unknown functions. These and other studies will be facilitated by the development of novel specific antibodies and neuronal markers as the annotation of the fire ant genome is completed.MethodsInsects Polygyne (multiple-queens) colonies of S. invicta were obtained from the Fire Ant Research Laboratory in the Department of Entomology (Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA) and maintained as previous described [89]. All colonies were screened for absence of microsporidium (Kneallhazia (=Thelohania) solenopsae) spores infection. Virgin queens (alates) and mated queens (de-alates) were collected from multiple polygyne colonies. Newly mated queens were collected from the field after mating flights; queens can be abundantly found at around 3-4 p.m. Queens were brought to the laboratory and maintained at 27°C in glass tubes which acted as humidity chambers by half-filling them with water and cotton. Ovaries were dissected 24 h after collection. During dissection, successfully mated queens were identified by observing an inseminated large and white spermatheca; only tissues from these inseminated queens were used.Antibodies To determine the antigenic regions of fire ant sNPF receptor (GenBank: DQ026281) for anti-peptide antibody production, the hydrophilicity and antigenicity profiles of sNPF receptor amino acid sequence were analyzed using DNASTAR and ExPAsy software. Additionally, the N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites were avoided in the selection for the antigenic region. Due to a very short N-terminal sequence present in the receptor before the first transmembrane region (total 23 residues), only one amino acid region located toward the receptor C-terminus encompassing residues 331 to 347 of sequence "CRGDKIDNGNNTMQETL" was selected for antibody production. Polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies were developed in New Zealand female rabbits by Pacific Immunology (CA, USA) and affinity purified. The synthetic peptide was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) for antibody production. After purification, the specificity of the antibodies was verified by ELISA (tested by Pacific Immunology, CA) and western blot.Membrane preparations and western blot analysis Membrane preparations for western blot analyses were performed as described previously with minor modifications [90]. Briefly, brains (with SEG) and the postpharyngeal glands from about 200 virgin queen heads were dissected in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In addition, brains (with SEG) and ovaries from about 200 virgin queens and 200 mated queens were also dissected in PBS. These tissues were homogenized in cold buffer A (25 mM Tris⁄HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol) with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail® (ROCHE) and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min. The supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 100,000 g (SW28 rotor, Beckman LE80K) for 1 h at 4°C. After ultracentrifugation, the pellets were re-suspended in 200 μl cold buffer B (50 mM Tris ⁄ HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCl2) with protease inhibitors and stored at -80°C. For western blot analysis, membrane proteins (100 μg) were separated on SDS-PAGE (10% gel, Bio-Rad) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution [5% non-fat milk in TBST (10 mM Tris base, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4)] and incubated overnight with rabbit anti-sNPF receptor antibodies (1:500) in blocking solution at 4°C. Pre-absorbed anti-sNPF receptor antibodies and pre-immune serum were used as negative controls. Pre-absorbed antibodies were produced by incubating anti-sNPF receptor antibodies (4 μg in 10 ml blocking solution) with peptide antigen (500 μg) overnight at 4°C the day previous to their use. After 3 × 10 min washes with TBST, the membrane was then incubated with a of HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:40,000) for 1 h. After the same wash steps, the membrane was visualized by the Enhanced Chemiluminescence System™ (Pierce) on film (Kodak).Brain and SEG whole mount immunofluorescence analysis Whole mount immunofluorescence was performed as previously described with modifications [91]. Brains of both virgin and mated queens were dissected in PBS and transferred into freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 h at 4°C for fixation. All subsequent steps were carried out with slow agitation. The fixatives were removed by 3 × 10 min washes with 70% ethanol, on ice. After rinsed in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween) 2 × 5 min at room temperature, tissues were incubated in 12 μg/ml protease K (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Tissues were then rinsed in PBST 2 × 5 min and then blocked in PBST with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h at 4°C. After blocking, tissues were incubated with primary antibody for 48 h at 4°C. The primary antibodies diluted in PBST-2% NGS included the anti-sNPF receptor antibodies (diluted 1:100). For negative controls, anti-sNPF receptor antibodies (1:100 dilution) pre-absorbed with the antigen peptide, and pre-immune serum from rabbit (1:1000 dilution) were used as the primary antibody. Anti-sNPF receptor antibodies (4 μg in 1 ml PBST-2% NGS) were pre-absorbed with 500 μg of antigen peptide overnight at 4°C incubation one day before used. After incubated with primary antibodies, tissues were washed 4 × 20 min in PBST and incubated in a 1:200 dilution of Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen™) overnight at 4°C. Tissues were then washed 6 × 30 min in PBST and mounted on slides with Vectashield™-DAPI (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) for nuclear staining. Results were observed under a Carl Zeiss Axioimager A1 microscope. Images were obtained with an AxioCam MRc color camera (Carl Zeiss) and analyzed with axiovision program (Carl Zeiss). Confocal images were taken using FV1000 Confocal microscope (Olympus) in Microscopy and Imaging Center (TAMU) and images were analyzed with Olympus FV10-ASW program (Olympus). Naming of the brain structures was following previous articles on honey bee [59]. Orientation of neuronal structures was given according to the body axis.Ovary immunofluorescence analysis Ovaries of virgin and mated queens within colonies, and ovaries of field-collected newly-mated queens (24 h after mating flight) were dissected in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4°C. The procedures of ovary paraffin wax blocks, de-waxing and rehydration of ovary sections (12 μm), and ovary immunofluorescence labeling were as previously described [90]. Sections were blocked with blocking solution (5% goat serum in PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100) 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight in a humid chamber at 4°C with the anti-sNPF receptor antibodies (1:1000 dilution) in the blocking solution. Negative control sections were also incubated overnight with the pre-absorbed anti-sNPF receptor antibodies (1:1000 dilution) or the pre-immune sera (1:500 dilution) in blocking solutions. The preabsorbed anti-sNPF receptor antibodies were produced as described above.List of abbreviations sNPF: short neuropeptide F; CNS: central nervous system; mCa: medial calyces; lCa: lateral calyces; sP, slP, smP, iP, ilP, imP: the superior, the superior lateral, superior medial, inferior, inferior lateral, and inferior medial protocerebrum, respectively; SEG: subesophageal ganglion.Authors' contributions H.-L.

Since vitamin D exerts significant metabolic activities, comprising free fatty acids (FFA) flux regulation from the periphery to the liver, its deficiency may promote fat deposition into the hepatocytes. Aim of our study was to test the hypothesis of a direct association between hypovitaminosis D and the presence of NAFLD in subjects with various degree of insulin-resistance and related metabolic disorders. We studied 262 consecutive subjects referred to the Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases clinics for metabolic evaluation. NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) was diagnosed by upper abdomen ultrasonography, metabolic syndrome was identified according to the Third Report of National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP/ATPIII) modified criteria. Insulin-resistance was evaluated by means of HOMA-IR. Fatty-Liver-Index, a recently identified correlate of NAFLD, was also estimated. Serum 25(OH)vitamin D was measured by colorimetric method. Patients with NAFLD (n = 162,61.8%) had reduced serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels compared to subjects without NAFLD (14.8 ± 9.2 vs 20.5 ± 9.7 ng/ml, p < 0.001, OR 0.95, IC 95% 0.92-0.98). The relationship between NAFLD and reduced 25(OH)vitamin D levels was independent from age, sex, triglycerides, high density lipoproteins (HDL) and glycaemia (p < 0.005) and Fatty Liver Index inversely correlated with low 25(OH) vitamin D regardless sex, age and HOMA-IR (p < 0.007). Low 25(OH)vitamin D levels are associated with the presence of NAFLD independently from metabolic syndrome, diabetes and insulin-resistance profile.

NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) was diagnosed by upper abdomen ultrasonography, metabolic syndrome was identified according to the Third Report of National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP/ATPIII) modified criteria. Insulin-resistance was evaluated by means of HOMA-IR. Fatty-Liver-Index, a recently identified correlate of NAFLD, was also estimated. Serum 25(OH)vitamin D was measured by colorimetric method. Patients with NAFLD (n = 162,61.8%) had reduced serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels compared to subjects without NAFLD (14.8 ± 9.2 vs 20.5 ± 9.7 ng/ml, p < 0.001, OR 0.95, IC 95% 0.92-0.98). The relationship between NAFLD and reduced 25(OH)vitamin D levels was independent from age, sex, triglycerides, high density lipoproteins (HDL) and glycaemia (p < 0.005) and Fatty Liver Index inversely correlated with low 25(OH) vitamin D regardless sex, age and HOMA-IR (p < 0.007). Low 25(OH)vitamin D levels are associated with the presence of NAFLD independently from metabolic syndrome, diabetes and insulin-resistance profile. Background Vitamin D is a lipophilic molecule essential to calcium and phosphate balance and osteo-metabolic system regulation. It is produced onto the skin through a UV-mediated reaction, then it is metabolized to its active 1α,25 (OH)2 form through two consecutive hydroxylations exerted by kidney and liver, respectively. In adult population, the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D is from 5% to 30% [1], but it reaches a peak of 75% in patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) [2]. Several evidences have shown a thigh link between serum vitamin D level, calcium homeostasis and the risk for cardiovascular disease [3,4]. Interestingly, vitamin D deficient individuals are more likely to develop alterations in glucose metabolism, such as impaired glucose tolerance, the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus [5-7]. Based on these evidences, it can be hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency should not be considered an exclusive feature of patients with osteo-mineral disorders. Vitamin D is capable to reduce FFA-induced insulin resistance both in peripheral tissues and in hepatocytes [8]. Therefore, low serum vitamin D may predispose to intrahepatic lipid accumulation leading to NAFLD. NAFLD is a pathological condition consisting in a spectrum of liver diseases due to macrovesicular accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes (hepatic steatosis). In developed countries, NAFLD is observed in 20-30% of the general population [9,10] and in 75% of type 2 diabetic patients [11,12]; necro-inflammatory activity and fibrosis coexist in the 2-3% of cases (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) and may evolve in cirrhosis and liver failure in 20-25% of affected subjects [13-15]. Currently, NAFLD is considered one of the leading causes of cryptogenetic cirrhosis [16]. Recently, an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with NAFLD has been also suggested [17], based on the strong association between NAFLD and MS [18]. Thus, NAFLD is historically considered the hepatic component of MS, attributable to insulin-resistance that increases NEFA (non-esterified fatty acids) release from adipose tissue into the bloodstream and favors their deposition into hepatocytes [19]. However, recent investigations hypothesized a primary role of fatty liver in determining insulin resistance and its consequences [20]. Therefore, aim of this study was to test the hypothesis of an association between hypovitaminosis D and the presence/degree of NAFLD.MethodsPopulation under study To these purposes, we studied 262 consecutive subjects referred to the Diabetes and Hepatology outpatient clinics of Sapienza University of Rome for suspected MS. To be eligible for the study, patients had to fulfil the following criteria: normal serum liver enzymes, no history of current or past excessive alcohol drinking as defined by an average daily consumption of alcohol < 30 g/die in men and < 20 g/die in women; negative tests for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody to hepatitis C virus; absence of history and findings consistent with cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases. All subjects had a complete work-up including a clinical examination, anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests and a liver US scan.Laboratory determinations Study population underwent fasting blood sampling to assess blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), alkaline phosphatase, nitrogen and creatinine by standard laboratory methods. Insulin was measured by radio-immuno-assay (ADVIA Insulin Ready Pack 100, Bayer Diagnostics, Milan, Italy), with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation < 5%. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol value was obtained using Friedwald formula. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated as previously described [21]. MS was defined according to modified NCEP ATP-III criteria [22] and diabetes mellitus according to ADA 2009 criteria [23].NAFLD evaluation Liver ultrasonography (US) scanning was performed to assess the degree of steatosis. All US were performed by the same operator who was unaware of the aims of the study and blinded to laboratory values using an Esaote Medica apparatus equipped with a convex 3,5 MHz probe. Liver steatosis was scored semiquantitatively on a scale of 0-3; 0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. Steatosis was graded according to Saverymuttu et al. [24] on the basis of abnormally intense, high level echoes arising from the hepatic parenchyma, liver-kidney difference in echo amplitude, echo penetration into deep portion of the liver and clarity of liver blood vessel structure. We also evaluated the Fatty Liver Index (FLI), a clinical and metabolic correlate of NAFLD, in both patients and non-NAFLD subjects. FLI is expressed as a 0-100 range number; a value < 30 rules out and >60 rules in the presence of hepatic steatosis with a sensibility and specificity of 87% and 86%, though the following formula: FLI = (e 0.953*loge (triglycerides) + 0.139*BMI + 0.718*loge (ggt) + 0.053*waist circumference - 15.745)/(1 + e 0.953*loge (triglycerides) + 0.139*BMI + 0.718*loge (ggt) + 0.053*waist circumference - 15.745) * 100 [25].25(OH) vitamin D measurement In order to assess the calcitriol balance in our population, we measured serum 25(OH) vitamin D, the most stable circulating form of this molecule [26,27]. Blood samples were obtained in the same season and 25(OH) vitamin D was measured by a validated colorimetric method (LAISON, DiaSorin) on sera frozen immediately after separation and stored at -25°C for few days.Statistics SPSS version 17 statistical package was used to perform the analyses. Student's T-test for continuous variables and χ2 test for categorical variables were used to compare mean values between two independent groups. Because HOMA-IR, FBG, triglycerides, AST, ALT, GGT and alkaline phosphatase were skewed, we used natural logarithmic transformations of these variables before performing means comparison (Student's T-test), ordinal and multivariate regression analyses. Logistic regression was used to estimate the predictive value of 25(OH) vitamin D and metabolic parameters on the presence of NAFLD, considered as dichotomous variable. Ordinal regression was used to detect the association between predictor variables and presence and degree of NAFLD (0: absence, 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe). FLI and 25(OH) vitamin D were analyzed as continuous variables. A multiple liner regression analysis was performed to investigate independent association between FLI (dependent variable) and clinical and biochemical parameters. The comparison of clinical/biochemical characteristics among different 25(OH) vitamin D quartiles was performed by means of ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis analyses, as appropriate. Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation. For all the above, a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Commettee of Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome and conducted in conformance with the Helsinki Declaration. Written consent was obtained from all patients before the study.Results Out of the 262 consecutive subjects who underwent liver US examination, 162 (61.8%) were affected by NAFLD (43.0% mild, 39.2% moderate and 17.8% severe) and 100 were free from NAFLD or other liver diseases. NAFLD and non-NAFLD subjects differed significantly in several parameters, such as BMI (p < 0.001), waist circumference (p < 0.001) HDL (p < 0.001) and triglycerides (p < 0.001).

Multivariate regression analysis performed in this normal-weight population showed that the association between NAFLD and vitamin D was independent from sex, age, FBG, triglycerides and BMI (Table 3).Table 3 Multiple logistic regression analysis in subject with BMI< 25 Kg/m2.TermOdds Ratio95% C.I.CoefficientS.

After stratifying the study sample according to serum 25(OH) vitamin D quartiles, we observed an increased prevalence of NAFLD, MS and its components in the lowest 25(OH) vitamin D quartiles, whereas the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) was similar throughout the quartiles of vitamin D.

Interestingly, the lowest 25(OH) vitamin D quartile showed an OR = 4.71 (CI 2.15-10.3, p < 0.001) for NAFLD compared to the highest one.FLI, fatty liver and 25(OH) vitamin D NAFLD patients had significantly higher FLI compared to non-NAFLD subjects (71.6 ± 25.2 vs 30.2 ± 28.9, p < 0.001) and the correlation between US detected NAFLD and FLI was extremely tight, both when considering fatty liver as dichotomous variable (r = 0.61, p < 0.001), and when considering NAFLD severity scale (r = 0.66, p < 0.001). FLI inversely correlated with 25(OH) vitamin D regardless sex, age and HOMA-IR (Unstandardized β coefficient: -1.6, standardized β coefficient: -0.4, p < 0.007).T2D and 25(OH) vitamin D We also analyzed our study population according to the presence of T2D. Patients affected by T2D had serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels similar to non diabetic patients (17 ± 10.2 ng/ml vs 17.5 ± 8.8, p = n.s.); the logistic regression analysis performed in the whole population confirmed that vitamin D was not a determinant of diabetes (p = n.s.)Discussion This study demonstrates that subjects affected by NAFLD have reduced serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels compared to age and sex matched individuals without NAFLD. This relationship is independent from the presence of T2D, MS and its individual components. Subjects belonging to the lowest vitamin D quartile display a significantly increased prevalence of NAFLD and MS, suggesting the presence of an overall increased cardiometabolic risk profile. Previously, an association between low 25(OH) vitamin D levels and the histological severity of NASH was suggested by Targher et al. [29] in patients with chronically elevated liver enzymes and hepatic steatosis detected by US, who underwent liver biopsy for suspected steatohepatitis. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between fatty liver and hypovitaminosis D in a cohort of subjects with different degrees of insulin-resistance and no previously diagnosed liver disease, who were well characterized with respect to medical history, anthropometric measures and biochemical parameters. NAFLD was assessed by liver US, which has been demonstrated to have a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 100% using histological criteria as gold standard [24]. US is suitable for routine evaluation of fatty liver in dysmetabolic patients, who, in most cases, do not get progressive liver disease and can be well managed without a need for liver biopsy, which cannot be performed at large in patients with no significant or trivial liver disease, mainly for ethical reasons. Yet, in our series, subjects had normal ALT and no clinical indication for histological confirmation of NAFLD. We also calculated the Fatty Liver Index (FLI), a simple and accurate predictor of hepatic steatosis in the general population [25]. In our study cohort FLI tightly correlated with the presence/degree of NAFLD detected by US and the association between FLI and low vitamin D concentration was independent from sex, age and insulin resistance, quantified by means of HOMA-IR. Vitamin D is known to be stored into the adipocytes and serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels could be significantly influenced by body composition. We did not make direct measurements of body fatness but we measured waist circumference and BMI which are proxies for adiposity, as largely demonstrated [30]. Because of the possible confounding role of adiposity in determining serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels among patients with BMI above normal limits [31], we performed a logistic multivariate analysis also adjusting for BMI demonstrating that the association between NAFLD and 25(OH) vitamin D persists after BMI adjustment. Furthermore, we performed a sub-analysis in normal-weight patients and controls and demonstrated that 25(OH) vitamin D was significantly reduced in NAFLD individuals compared to subjects without NAFLD, independently from fatness and other possible confounding factors. The role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of hepatic diseases is actually of great interest. In the liver, vitamin D acts as an "immune-modulator" suppressing fibroblast proliferation and collagen production [32,33]. Novel studies demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency was associated with low rate of sustained virological response (SVR) in patients affected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) under interferon-alfa therapy [34,35]. Furthermore, a recent intervention trial showed that vitamin D supplementation improves the probability of achieving a SVR following antiviral treatment in patients with recurrent hepatitis C [36]. Serum vitamin D inversely associated with the presence of dysmetabolic conditions in our study as well as in other published reports [5-7] and may play a role in both NAFLD and cirrhosis outcomes though its anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing activities [37,38]. Moreover, vitamin D directly regulates the metabolism of FFAs by means of its action on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) improving FFA-induced insulin resistance in vitro. Therefore, under condition of vitamin D deficiency, the increased FFAs flow in the bloodstream may promote fat storage into the liver and facilitate the development of NAFLD. Our study has some limitations. First, the presence of less common causes of liver disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, or Wilson's disease, cannot be ruled out in our patients. Second, although US is a practical approach commonly used to detect liver steatosis, it is not the gold standard technique for quantitative liver fat assessment. Another limitation of this study relates to its cross-sectional design, that does not allow to establish a causality nexus between low serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels and the presence of NAFLD.Conclusions In conclusion, we demonstrate a strong independent association between low 25(OH) vitamin D levels and NAFLD in a population of adults without signs of severe liver damage even when the diagnosis of fatty liver is based on routine US examination; this association is independent from diabetes, lipid profile alterations and insulin resistance and is partially hidden by fatness in overweight subjects. Besides, an inverse correlation between serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels and the degree of NAFLD was observed, suggesting that vitamin D may exert a dose-dependent effect on fat accumulation into the hepatocytes. Despite the cross-sectional design of this study, not allowing to establish a causal nexus, overall our data may suggest a significant contribution of hypovitaminosis D in the pathogenesis of liver steatosis. Intervention trials are warranted to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation may be a means to prevent and/or treat NAFLD.Abbreviations ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; BMI: body mass index; FBG: fasting blood glucose; FFA: free fatty acids; FLI: fatty liver index; gamma-GT: gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; HCV: hepatitis C virus; HDL: high density lipoprotein; HOMA-IR: homeostatis model assessment of insulin resistance; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; MS: metabolic syndrome; NAFLD: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; NASH: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; NCEP/ATPIII: Third Report of National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel; PPAR-γ: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; T2D: type 2 diabetes.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributions All authors were involved in the conception and design of this study.

The botanical extracts suppressed IL-1-induced NF-B activation by inhibition of IB phosphorylation, IB degradation, p65 phosphorylation, and p65 nuclear translocation. These events correlated with downregulation of NF-B targets including COX-2 and MMPs. The extracts also reversed the IL-1-induced downregulation of collagen type II, CSPG, 1-integrin, and cartilage-specific transcription factor SOX-9 protein expression. In high-density cultures botanical extracts stimulated new cartilage formation even in the presence of IL-1. Botanical extracts exerted anti-inflammatory and anabolic effects on chondrocytes. The observed reduction of IL-1-induced NF-B activation suggests that further studies are warranted to demonstrate the effectiveness of plant extracts in the treatment of OA and other conditions in which NF-B plays pathophysiological roles.

Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disease involving not only articular cartilage but also the synovial membrane, subchondral bone and periarticular soft tissues [1]. OA may occur following traumatic injury to the joint, subsequent to an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. The symptoms and signs characteristic of OA in the most frequently affected joints are heat, swelling, pain, stiffness and limited mobility. Other sequelae include osteophyte formation and joint malalignment. These manifestations are highly variable, depending on joint location and disease severity [2]. OA is grossly characterized by aberrant synthesis of extracellular matrix, gradual hypocellularity, eventual fragmentation and degradation of cartilage, new bone formation in the periarticular region (osteophytosis), decreased, then increased, subchondral bone density, and variable synovial inflammation [3]. In OA, mechanical stress initiates cartilage lesions by altering chondrocyte-matrix interaction and metabolic responses in the chondrocytes [4]. The interaction between chondrocytes and matrix proteins is mediated largely by the β1-integrin receptors [5]. This interaction plays a crucial role in regulating several biological phenomena, including cell morphology, gene expression, and cell survival. β1-integrins are transmembrane signal transduction receptors mediating cell-matrix interactions in cartilage [6]. An important signal transduction pathway activated by β1-integrin receptors is the MAPKinase pathway [7, 8]. Furthermore, disruption of cell matrix communication by inhibition of the MAPKinase pathway has been shown to lead to caspase-3 activation, cleavage of Poly(ADP)Ribose polymerase, and chondrocyte apoptosis [8]. There are initial increases in the amounts of water and proteoglycans associated with the observed transient chondrocyte proliferation of early OA. Proliferating chondrocytes appear in clusters and are accompanied by a change in cellular morphology and phenotype, indicating a hypertrophic differentiation process. At the molecular level, OA is characterized by loss of cartilage matrix components, particularly type II collagen and aggrecan due to an imbalance between extracellular matrix destruction and repair [9]. Although OA chondrocytes have increased expression of both anabolic and catabolic matrix genes [10], their catabolic ability is considered to dominate their anabolic capacity resulting in cartilage loss. As OA progresses from mild to severe, there is a decrease in transcription of collagen, failure to maintain the proteoglycan matrix, and reduced ability of the chondrocytes to regulate apoptosis [11]. In contrast, collagen type X, which is normally produced by terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes, has been demonstrated in surrounding chondrocyte clusters in OA cartilage [12]. Chondrocyte proliferation (cloning) is considered to be an attempt to repair and counteract cartilage degradation. However, disease progression and secondary inflammation indicate that this is generally unsuccessful. The short-lived hyperplasia (chondrocyte cloning) is followed by hypocellularity and apoptosis [13]. Catabolic events responsible for cartilage matrix degradation include (i) the release of catabolic cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α [14]; (ii) the production of matrix degrading enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), mainly, stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and collagenase-3 (MMP-13); (iii) reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by chondrocytes in OA [4, 14]. Imbalance between MMPs and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) occurs, resulting in active MMPs and consequent cartilage matrix degradation. However, IL-1β may also contribute to the depletion of cartilage matrix by decreasing synthesis of cartilage specific proteoglycans and collagen type II [4, 15]. The proinflammatory effects of IL-1β and TNF-α in OA are regulated by the transcription factor “nuclear transcription factor κB” (NF-κB) [16]. The subunits of NF-κB (p65 and p50) are located in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex in association with an inhibiting IκBα subunit. In response to phosphorylation, IκBα dissociates from the complex and NF-κB translocates to the cell nucleus and binds to target genes of NF-κB [17]. NF-κB might be also responsible for downregulation of the transcription factor SOX-9, which is involved in the regulation of genes for cartilage-specific extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins [18]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are currently the most widely used anti-inflammatory drugs. However, they exhibit numerous undesired side effects and are only temporarily effective. Therefore, naturally occurring botanical extracts capable of inhibiting NF-κB mediated catabolic activity may prove to be promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of OA [19]. Plant extracts with anti-inflammatory activity may also help to reduce the frequency of consumption and dosage of NSAIDs in arthritis patients. In recent years there has been a proliferation of research into botanical extracts with potential anti-inflammatory properties [20]. The most important factor that drives the interest in botanical extracts is the realization that inflammation plays a central role in the development of many chronic diseases in humans and companion animals. The use of herbal medicine is increasing among human arthritis patients in the United States and western Europe [21]. According to The Arthritis Foundation, almost 45% of patients in North America apply ointments or rubs for OA. A variety of topical and oral preparations are currently available. Many of these are traditional Chinese, Indian, or Korean herbal medicines, which have been used in the armamentarium of indigenous practitioners. The best-studied botanicals investigated to date include rosehip (Rosa canina) [22], Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F extract [23], Triptolide [24], Devil's Claw (Harpagophytum procumbens) [25], ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) [26], and Withania somnifera (ashwagandha) [27]. In addition, conventional [28] and several systematic reviews [29] have examined published evidence for the effectiveness of botanical anti-inflammatory drugs. A few of these have specifically focused on the treatment of OA and chronic low back pain [30, 31]. The present study was designed to characterize the effects and mechanism of action of three botanical extracts; rosehip (Rosa canina), willow bark (Salix alba), and nettle leaf (Urtica dioica) in primary canine articular chondrocytes. Previous studies have reported on the anti-inflammatory activity of Urtica dioica [17, 30, 31]. In this study, we show that these botanical extracts exhibit a strong capacity for the inhibition of NF-κB and its regulated gene products in chondrocytes in vitro.2. Materials and Methods2.1.

Trypsin/EDTA (EC 3.4.21.4) was purchased from Sigma (Munich, Germany). Epon was obtained from Plano (Marburg, Germany). IL-1β was obtained from Strathman Biotech GmbH (Hannover, Germany).2.3. Preparation of the Botanical Extracts The botanical extracts from rosehip (Rosa canina), white willow bark (Salix alba) and nettle leaf (Urtica dioica) were supplied as powders from Shamanshop, Camden, NY, USA; catalogue numbers (202055-51_C, 202295-51_C, and 201865-51_C, resp.). The botanical extracts were prepared using chloroform, a commonly used solvent in the laboratory because it is relatively unreactive, miscible with most organic liquids, and conveniently volatile. Also, plant material is commonly extracted with chloroform for pharmaceutical processing. Chloroform solvent extractions were carried out by Puleva Biotech, Granada, Spain. Each botanical extract (~10 g) was packed in filter paper and loaded into the main chamber of a Soxhlet extraction unit. Chloroform (200 mL) was heated to reflux and incubated for 2 h. Following chloroform-evaporation under vacuum in a rotary evaporator (placed in a water bath at 60°C) the soluble botanical extract was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a stock concentration of 10 mg/mL and stored in aliquots at −80°C. The final concentration of DMSO did not, in any case, exceed 0.1%. Further dilutions were made in cell culture medium to achieve the final working concentrations.2.4. Chondrocyte Isolation and Culture Primary canine articular chondrocytes were isolated from the joints of client-owned dogs undergoing orthopaedic surgery at the Clinic of Veterinary Surgery, Ludwig-Maximilian-University Munich, Germany. Fully informed owner consent was obtained and the Ethical Review Committees of WALTHAM, Ludwig-Maximilian-University, and the University of Nottingham approved the project. Cartilage explants were sliced and digested primarily with 1% pronase for 2 h at 37°C and subsequently with 0.2% collagenase for 4 h at 37°C. Isolated chondrocytes were maintained in culture medium at a density of 0.1 × 106 cells/mL in Petri dishes in monolayer culture and on glass plates for a period of 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2.2.5. Experimental Design Serum-starved chondrocytes (passage two, cultivated in 3% FCS) were treated with the botanical extracts (10 μg/mL) alone for 24 h (pretreatment) and then cotreated with a combination of botanical extracts (10 μg/mL) and IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for a further 48 h in monolayer cultures. Chondrocytes treated with the botanical extracts alone over the entire period served as treatments and those treated with IL-1β were used as “inflammatory” controls. In addition, untreated chondrocytes (i.e., cells only exposed to serum-starved medium) served as untreated controls. For investigation of NF-κB translocation and IκBα phosphorylation, chondrocytes were treated either with IL-1β (10 ng/mL) or cotreated with a combination of botanical extracts (10 μg/mL) and IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min and nuclear/cytoplasmic extracts were prepared.2.6. MTT Assay Chondrocytes were seeded in 96-well plates with 5000 cells/well and incubated overnight in culture medium containing 10% FCS. Positive control cells were left untreated or were treated with the compounds alone. Negative controls were cells treated with IL-1β alone. Additionally, chondrocytes were incubated only with the same quantity of DMSO in serum starved medium as in working solutions (without the botanical extracts). For every control and experimental treatment, three wells were used. For measurements after 0, 24, 48, and 72 h, the medium (with or without botanical extracts) was replaced with serum-starved medium and MTT (10 μL) was added. After incubation for 4 h at 37°C MTT solubilization solution was added and cells were incubated at 37°C until MTT formazan crystals were completely dissolved. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 550 nm with a spectrophotometer.2.7. Immunofluorescence Microscopy Cells were cultivated on glass plates and incubated for 24 h. The cells were then washed three times and preincubated for 1 h with serum-starved medium before stimulation with 10 ng/mL IL-1β or 10 μg/mL botanical extracts alone or cotreated with 10 μg/mL botanical extracts and 10 ng/mL IL-1β for 30 min in serum-starved (3% FCS) medium. Cells on the glass plates were washed three-times in Hanks solution before methanol fixation for 10 min at ambient temperature (AT), and rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell and nuclear membranes of chondrocytes were permeabilized by treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min on ice. Cells were washed with bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 10 min at AT, rinsed with PBS, and incubated with primary antibodies (p65, phospho-p65, 1 : 30 in PBS). They were gently washed several times with PBS before incubation with secondary antibody (goat-anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated with FITC, diluted 1 : 50 in PBS). Glass plates were finally washed three-times with PBS, covered with fluoromount mountant, and examined under a light microscope (Axiophot 100, Zeiss, Germany).2.8. Isolation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Chondrocyte Extracts Chondrocytes were trypsinized and washed twice in ice-cold PBS (1 mL). The supernatant was removed and cell pellets were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (400 μL) containing protease inhibitors. After incubation on ice for 15 min, 10% NP-40 (12.5 μL) was added and the cell suspension was vigorously mixed for 15 sec. The extracts were centrifuged for 1.5 min. The supernatants (cytoplasmic extracts) were frozen at −70°C. Ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer (25 μL) was added to the pellets and incubated for 30 min with intermittent mixing. Extracts were centrifuged and the supernatant (nuclear extracts) transferred to pre-chilled tubes for storage at −70°C.2.9. High-Density Cultures The high density mass culture was performed on a steel grid bridge as previously described [5]. Briefly, a cellulose filter was placed on the bridge onto which a cell suspension (8 μL), containing approximately 1 million cells, was placed. Culture medium was in contact with the filter and the cells were maintained at the filter-medium interface through diffusion. After one day in culture, cells formed a three-dimensional pellet on the filter. Culture medium was changed every three days.2.10. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Cells were fixed for 1 h with Karnovsky's fixative (paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde) followed by postfixation in 1% OsO4 solution (0.1 M phosphate buffer), as previously described [32]. Monolayer cell pellets were rinsed and dehydrated in an ascending alcohol series before being embedded in Epon and cut on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E (Darmstadt, Germany). Ultrathin sections were contrasted with 2% uranyl acetate/lead citrate. A transmission electron microscope (TEM 10, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) was used to examine the cultures.2.11. Western Blot Analysis Chondrocyte monolayers were washed three times with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) and whole cell proteins were extracted by incubation with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, l% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 0.01% (v/v) aprotinin, 4 μg/mL pepstatin A, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF) on ice for 30 min, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were stored at −70°C. Total protein concentration of whole cell, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts was determined according to the bicinchoninic acid system (Uptima, Interchim, Montlucon, France) using BSA as a standard. After adjusting the equal amounts (50 μg of protein per lane) of total protein, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (5, 7.5% gels) under reducing conditions. The separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were preincubated in blocking buffer (5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder in PBS/0.1% Tween-20) for 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies (1 h, AT). Membranes were washed three times with blocking buffer and incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min. They were finally washed three times in 0.1 M Tris pH 9.5 containing 0.05 M MgCl2 and 0.1 M NaCl. Nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoylphosphate (p-toluidine salt; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) were used as substrates to reveal alkaline phosphatase-conjugated specific antigen-antibody complexes. 2.12. Statistical Analysis The results are expressed as the means ± SD of a representative experiment performed in triplicate. The means were compared using student's t-test assuming equal variances and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.3. Results This in vitro study was undertaken to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of three botanical extracts on the signaling pathway leading to the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and a selection of its target gene products, namely, proteins important to chondrocyte function. Chondrocytes treated with botanical extracts (10 μg/mL) showed no signs of cytotoxicity at the light and electron microscopic (ultrastructural) levels. IL-1β was used to examine the effect of botanical extracts on the NF-κB activation pathway, because the pathway activated by this cytokine is relatively well understood. 3.1. Botanical Extracts Suppress IL-1β-Induced Chondrocyte Cytotoxicity To test IL-1β-inhibited chondrocyte proliferation an MTT assay was performed to study the effects of botanical extracts on the viability and proliferation of chondrocytes treated with or without IL-1β. The MTT assay is based on the ability of living cells to reduce the MTT salt, whereas dead cells or those with impaired mitochondrial activity are unable to do so. Chondrocytes were cultured in a 96-well plate and treated with IL-1β, botanical extracts, and botanical extracts then treated with IL-1β for the indicated times. The viability and proliferation of the chondrocytes cultivated only in the presence of IL-1β was significantly lower compared to those of chondrocytes treated with botanical extracts, botanical extracts and IL-1β, or left untreated (Figure 1). The results showed a positive effect of three botanical extracts with regard to cell viability and proliferation on inhibiting IL-1β-induced cytotoxicity on chondrocytes.3.2. Botanical Extracts Block IL-1β-Induced Cellular/Ultrastructural Changes and Apoptosis in Chondrocytes Control monolayer chondrocytes after 24 (not shown), 48 (Figure 2(a)), and 72 h (not shown) showed a typical flattened shape with small cytoplasmic processes, a large, mostly euchromatic nucleus with nucleoli and a well-structured cytoplasm. IL-1β-treatment of chondrocyte monolayer cultures for 24 (data not shown) and 48 h (Figure 2(b)) lead to degenerative changes such as multiple vacuoles, swelling of rough ER, clustering of swollen mitochondria, and degeneration of other cell organelles. After longer incubation periods (72 h) (data not shown) more severe features of cellular degeneration were seen in response to IL-1β treatment. These included areas of condensed heterochromatin in the cell nuclei and multiple cytoplasmic vacuoles. The flattened monolayer chondrocytes became increasingly rounded and apoptotic (Figure 2(b)). Chondrocytes pretreated with any of the botanical extracts (10 μg/mL) (24 h) and then cotreated with IL-1β and the same botanical extracts (10 μg/mL) for 48 h showed less severe cellular degeneration on the ultrastructural level (Figures 2(c)–2(e)). The chondrocytes remained a flattened shape with numerous microvilli-like cytoplasmic processes. Chondrocytes treated with botanical extracts alone (each at 10 μg/mL) showed no signs of cytotoxic effects on the viability of cells at the light microscopic and ultrastructural levels (Figures 2(f)–2(h)). Taken together, these results indicate that all three botanical extracts have antiapoptotic effects and counteract IL-1β-induced apoptosis in chondrocytes. 3.3. Botanical Extracts Inhibit IL-1β-Induced Downregulation of Extracellular Matrix and Signaling Proteins in Chondrocytes Serum-starved chondrocytes were treated with IL-1β (10 ng/mL) alone or were preincubated with three different botanical extracts (10 μg/mL each) for 24 h and then cotreated with IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 h. As shown in Figure 3, chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1β alone showed downregulation of synthesis of collagen type II (Figure 3(I)), cartilage-specific proteoglycan (CSPG) (Figure 3(II)), and β1-integrin (Figure 3(III)). In contrast to chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1β alone, pretreatment with all botanical extracts resulted in a significant up-regulation of synthesis of collagen type II (Figure 3(I)), CSPG, (Figure 3(II)) and β1-integrin (Figure 3(III)). In untreated and in positive control cultures, expression of collagen type II, CSPG, and β1-integrin were equally strong in chondrocytes (Figures 3(I)–3(III)). Synthesis of the housekeeping protein β-actin remained unaffected in chondrocytes exposed to botanicals (Figure 3(IV)). 3.4. Botanical Extracts Inhibit IL-1β-Induced Upregulation of NF-κB-Dependent ProInflammatory Enzymes and Matrix Degrading Gene Products in Chondrocytes IL-1β stimulation activates COX-2 and MMPs expression in chondrocytes [33]. To investigate whether the three botanical extracts were able to inhibit IL-1β-induced expression of these proteins, the following experiment was performed. Serum-starved chondrocytes were exposed to IL-1β (10 ng/mL) alone or were preincubated with three different botanical extracts (10 μg/mL each) for 24 hours and then co-treated with IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for 24, 48 and 72 h. The whole cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by western blotting for the presence of COX-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13 (Figures 4(I)–4(III)). As shown in Figure 4, chondrocytes showed up-regulation of synthesis of COX-2 (Figure 4(I)), MMP-9 (Figure 4(II)) and MMP-13 (Figure 4(III)) in response to IL-1β (10 ng/mL). In contrast to chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1β alone, pre-treatment with all botanical extracts and co-treatment with IL-1β led to a decrease in COX-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression (Figures 4(I)–4(III)). In untreated and positive control cultures, expression of COX-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13 was not detectable in chondrocytes (Figures 4(I)–4(III)). Synthesis of the housekeeping protein β-actin remained unaffected (Figure 4(IV)). 3.5. Botanical Extracts Inhibit the IL-1β-Induced Downregulation of Adaptor Protein Shc, Signaling Protein P-ERK1/2, and Cartilage-Specific Transcription Factor SOX-9 Expression in Chondrocytes The MAPKinase pathway plays an important role in chondrocyte differentiation and stimulates the chondrogenic factor SOX-9 in chondrocytes [7, 8]. SOX-9 is a transcription factor that controls the expression of chondrocyte-specific ECM protein genes and plays a pivotal role in chondrocyte differentiation, thus it was selected for this study. Additionally, the MAPKinase signaling pathway, the adaptor protein Shc and the extracellular regulated kinase (Erk1/2) were evaluated. To test the hypothesis that botanical extracts are able to stimulate SOX-9 production in chondrocytes, monolayer cultures were either left untreated or treated with IL-1β or botanical extracts alone or were pretreated with botanical extracts (10 μg/mL) for 24 h and then stimulated with IL-1β for 24 h. The cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. In untreated and in positive control cultures, expression of Shc, ERK1/2, and SOX-9 were equally strong in chondrocytes (Figures 5(I)–5(III)). The results demonstrated that treatment with the three botanical extracts inhibited the IL-1β-induced decrease in Shc, ERK1/2 and SOX-9 expression (Figures 5(I)–5(III)). Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. Synthesis of the housekeeping protein β-actin remained unaffected (Figure 5(IV)). 3.6. Botanical Extracts Inhibit IL-1β-Induced NF-κB Activation in Chondrocytes To examine if botanical extracts block the IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB, nuclear protein extracts from serum-starved chondrocytes were probed for the phosphorylated form of p65 NF-κB-subunit after pretreatment with botanical extracts (10 μg/mL each) for 4 hours followed by cotreatment with 10 ng/mL IL-1β and botanical extracts for 1 h. Some chondrocyte cultures remained either untreated or were treated with 10 μg/mL botanical extracts (each alone) or with 10 ng/mL IL-1β alone for 1 h (Figure 6(I)). Results indicate that botanical extracts inhibited IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation (Figure 6(I)). The synthesis of the PARP protein remained unaffected (Figure 6(II)). 3.7. Botanical Extracts Inhibit IL-1β-Stimulated Nuclear-Translocation of NF-κB in Chondrocytes Immunofluorescence microscopy was employed to reveal translocation of phosphorylated NF-κB from the chondrocyte cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to IL-1β. Chondrocytes remained either unstimulated (Figure 7(a)) or were treated with 10 μg/mL botanical extracts (each alone) or with 10 ng/mL IL-1β alone for 10 min (Figure 7(b)) or were cotreated with 10 μg/mL botanical extracts (each alone) 10 min and then 10 ng/mL IL-1β for 1h (Figures 7(c)–7(e)) before indirect immunolabeling with anti-NF-κB antibody. Control chondrocytes and chondrocytes treated with the botanical extracts alone (not shown) showed only cytoplasmic labeling of NF-κB (Figure 7(a)). IL-1β-stimulated cells revealed clear and intensive cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for NF-κB (Figure 7(b)). Cotreatment of chondrocytes with botanicals and IL-1β resulted in inhibition of nuclear transition of activated phosphor-p65 and decreased cytoplasmic staining for this protein and showed a decrease in activation of NF-κB (Figures 7(c)–7(e)). These immunomorphological findings were consistent with the NF-κB inhibition observed by western blotting. 3.8. Botanical Extracts Inhibit IL-1β-Induced IκBα Degradation in Chondrocytes In this study, botanical extracts inhibited IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB and its translocation to the chondrocyte nucleus. An important prerequisite for the activation of NF-κB is the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, the natural blocker of NF-κB [34]. To examine whether inhibition of IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation occurs through inhibition of IκBα degradation, some chondrocyte cultures were treated with IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for the indicated times (Figures 8(I)–8(III)) and other chondrocyte cultures were first treated with three botanical extracts (10 μg/mL each) for 4 h followed by co-treatment with IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for the indicated time periods. IL-1β could not induce IκBα degradation in chondrocytes when co-treated with botanical extracts (Figures 8(I)–8(III)). Considering, IL-1β-induced IκBα degradation in untreated cultures is an indicator of NF-κB activation, the results suggest that the botanical extracts block IL-1β-induced IκBα degradation.3.9. Botanical Extracts Inhibit IL-1β-Dependent IκBα Phosphorylation in Chondrocytes To determine if the botanical extracts are able to inhibit the IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of IκBα, serum-starved chondrocytes were treated with IL-1β for 1h and examined by western blot analysis using an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of IκBα. It is known that phosphorylation of IκBα leads to its degradation [16], and that the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα are inhibited by a specific proteosome inhibitor N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) [35]. As shown in Figures 9(I)–9(III), IL-1β was still able to phosphorylate some IκBα in cells pretreated with the inhibitor and IκBα phosphorylation was significantly higher compared to control cells. Interestingly, all botanical extracts were able to inhibit the phosphorylation of IκBα induced by IL-1β in the presence or absence of the inhibitor. 3.10. Botanical Extracts Inhibit IL-1β-Induced Effects in a 3-Dimensional (High-Density) Culture Model of Chondrocytes To test whether chondrocytes from monolayer cultures with or without IL-1β and/or botanicals were able to produce cartilage-specific ECM and cartilage, high-density cultures were prepared from chondrocytes in monolayer culture. These consisted of untreated control cells and cells treated with botanical extracts (10 μg/mL) or IL-1β (10 ng/mL) alone for 24 h before being treated with IL-1β (10 ng/mL) and cultivated for 7 days under identical conditions. As shown in Figure 10, control cultures of chondrocytes formed blastema-like nodules and made tight contacts. They exhibited round to oval shapes, large euchromatic nuclei, free cytoplasmic ribosomes, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as well as vacuoles. The cells appeared as viable chondrocytes exhibiting characteristic morphological features and formed a regular fibrillar extracellular matrix (Figure 10(a)). In contrast, chondrocytes underwent apoptosis when treated with IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for 7 days (Figure 10(b)). Chondrocytes co-treated with botanical extracts and IL-1β (each 10 μg/mL) showed well-developed cartilage nodules (Figures 10(c)–10(e)). Pre-treatment with botanical extracts (each 10 μg/mL) alone resulted in well-developed cartilage nodules with viable cells and organized organelles; the cells formed a dense and regular ECM (Figures 10(f)–10(h)). 4. Discussion The goal of this study was to characterize the effect and mode of action of three botanical extracts derived from plants with previously reported anti-inflammatory activity on NF-κB expression in primary canine chondrocytes in vitro. Under the experimental conditions, (1) botanical extracts inhibited the IL-1β-mediated suppression of key extracellular matrix and signaling proteins in chondrocytes; (2) botanical extracts antagonized the IL-1β-dependent upregulation of MMP-9, MMP-13, and COX-2; (3) IL-1β caused phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the p65 NF-κB subunit; (4) IL-1β caused phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the inhibitory subunit of NF-κB: IκBα; (5) IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation was inhibited by botanicals; (6) finally, in contrast to IL-1β-treated cells, the cells treated with botanical extracts redifferentiated into chondrocytes after transfer to high-density culture and produced a cartilage-specific matrix, that is, collagen type II, even when cotreated with IL-1β. Therefore, the results obtained strongly suggest that the botanical extracts inhibit IL-1β-induced up-regulation of MMP-9, MMP-13, and COX-2 by preventing, at least in part, IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation. The schematic in Figure 11 summarizes the possible mode of action of the botanical extracts. Systematic reviews of clinical studies show little evidence to support botanical remedies as efficacious the treatment for OA [36]. However, the three plants from which extracts have been analyzed in this study have been used in traditional medicines for many centuries and all had claims related to treatment for OA. Whilst patients continue to seek natural remedies to help treat themselves or their companion animals, it is important to provide insights into whether, and if so how, such botanicals may work. As such, in vitro models provide an objective benchmark to indicate potential modes of action if translated in vivo. The three botanical extracts in this study are derived from different parts of the plant and previous publications have claimed different active components. The data provided in this study may be used to suggest that there are actives in all three botanicals that can inhibit the IL-1β-induced inflammatory process upstream of the IκBα phosphorylation step. Whilst the exact mechanism of action remains unknown, the data may also be used to indicate that IL-1β-suppressing activities are common to a number of plant species and tissues. With a growing number of publications claiming specific actives, it may be an appropriate time to consider commonalities of botanical extracts rather than focus attention on “unique” attributes of a multitude of specific plants, which may lead to confusion and skepticism toward the area of phytotherapy. All three botanical extracts had a positive effect on chondrocyte viability, differentiation and function as well as having inhibitory effects on IL-1β-induced suppression of proliferation and viability. Furthermore, the three botanicals enhanced mitochondrial activity in chondrocytes, as measured using the MTT assay. Reports have observed botanicals that interfere with the assay through antioxidant (e.g., thiols and flavonoids) reduction of MTT [37], and we have also observed significant negative and insignificant responses with other botanicals (data not shown). Whilst the exact reason for the enhanced mitochondrial activity was not investigated, it was considered an indicator of enhanced metabolism and, as such, was considered a potentially positive attribute. Cell-matrix interactions in cartilage are essential for the proliferation, differentiation and survival of cells and this interaction is mediated by specific surface receptors, for example, integrins [6, 7, 38]. β1-integrins are able to organize cell surface mechanoreceptor complexes [39] and function as signal transduction molecules [40] stimulating MAPkinase pathways [7, 8]. Several studies have already shown that reduced cell-matrix interactions lead to inhibition of Erk1/2 signaling and stimulate the apoptotic pathway in chondrocytes [8]. In this in vitro model system, IL-1β induced downregulation of collagen type II, CSPG, and integrin expression in chondrocytes. These findings are in agreement with previous in vitro studies [18]. Treatment with three botanicals prevented the IL-1β-induced inhibition of collagen type II, CSPG, and integrin expression in IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes. In this study, IL-1β induced upregulation of MMP-9, MMP-13, and COX-2. Cell-matrix interaction requires a permanent remodeling of extracellular matrix proteins executed by MMPs, a group of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that cleave ECM molecules [41] and high levels of MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13) are found in the synovium and serum of OA and RA patients [42, 43]. COX-2 is an important mediator of pain and inflammation in OA joints [44] causing PGE2 and thromboxane production [45]. PGE2 induces many other pathological catabolic effects in cartilage such as decreased proliferation of chondrocytes and inhibition of ECM synthesis [45]. We suggest that the down-regulation of MMPs and COX-2 by botanicals is regulated, at least in part, via NF-κB inhibition, because the expression of these enzymes is regulated by NF-κB [33, 46–48]. Cytokine-induced MMP and COX-2 upregulation is regulated by activation of the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-κB [49]. This transcription factor plays an important role during the pathogenesis of OA, by mediating the expression of catabolic and inflammation-related genes. Interestingly, inhibitors of NF-κB have anti-inflammatory and antidegradative effects in animal models of OA [50]. In the present study, increased phosphorylation of p65 in response to IL-1β was demonstrated. This phosphorylation event, in turn, leads to its degradation and subsequent release of activated NF-κB. The results also showed that IκBα was completely abolished in the cytoplasmic extracts in chondrocyte cultures treated with IL-1β alone, indicating that this cytokine induced its degradation. This indicates NF-κB activation. Treatment of the chondrocyte cultures with the botanical extracts resulted in high concentrations of IκBα in the cytoplasm and decreased levels of phosphorylated p65 in nuclear extracts. These results strongly suggest that the botanical extracts inhibit IL-1β-induced downregulation of cartilage specific ECM compounds, MAPK-signaling proteins, cartilage-specific transcription factors and upregulation of proinflammatory and degrading enzymes through NF-κB activation by preventing, at least in part, IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. The cartilage-specific transcription factor SOX-9 plays an important role in the expression of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix genes [51]. In this study, a reduction in collagen type II and SOX-9 expression in chondrocytes after treatment with IL-1β was observed, in agreement with another study [52]. Other investigators have shown that cytokines partially reduce SOX-9 protein levels through a NF-κB-dependent, posttranscriptional mechanism in mouse chondrocytes [18]. However, by treating cells with the botanical extracts, inhibition of the IL-1β-induced NF-κB-dependent downregulation of collagen type II and SOX-9 expression was observed. The results of this study suggest that the botanical extracts markedly suppressed cytokine-induced activation and upregulation of proinflammatory enzymes such as MMPs and COX-2, transcription factor NF-κB and downregulation of cartilage-specific matrix components and important signaling proteins in chondrocytes. Whilst botanical extracts may exhibit multiple modes of action, based on the IκBα phosphorylation data, it is probable that inhibition of the IL-1β signaling pathway upstream of IκBα phosphorylation is likely to be the major cause of the anti-inflammatory activity observed in this study. Monolayer cultures of chondrocytes appear to be a valid model for investigating the mode of action of plant extracts with potential anti-inflammatory properties. However, in vivo chondrocytes exist within a three-dimensional extracellular matrix. Therefore, studies were also performed using high-density cultures, which indicated that the botanical extracts do inhibit IL-1β-induced inflammation and apoptosis, allowing the cells in high-density cultures to redifferentiate back into chondrocytes. 5. Conclusion The three botanical extracts used in this study were derived from different parts of the plants used in traditional medicine. Previous publications have claimed different active components and several constituents which have anti-inflammatory effects. In this study similar in vitro effects of these three different botanical extracts are important observations and can be used to support the view that they may be potential chondroprotective agents. However, further investigations are needed to characterize the biological entities present within the extracts, to elucidate their subcellular targets in vitro and to determine whether they are capable of any similar activity or synergism in vivo.

Introduction Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a clinical and genetic heterogeneous group of inherited motor and sensory peripheral neuropathies (HMSN) that affect 17–40 per 100,000 inhabitants [1, 2]. Mendelian segregation in families may follow either autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked patterns. Autosomal recessive forms are described more frequently in specific populations and geographical areas such as the Mediterranean basin. Molecular genetic studies and positional cloning, and more recently exome sequencing approaches, have unraveled a wide number of genes involved in the etiology of CMT disease [3–5]. Molecular genetic studies have been very successful for defining the gene nosology and classification of inherited peripheral neuropathies; more than 40 genes have so far been identified to be associated with CMT and related neuropathies, including rare clinical variants (http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/CMTmutations/). As an immediate consequence, genetic testing has become an important tool in clinical practice of CMT, and patients and families have been beneficiated of a more specific genetic counseling. CMT is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins with different locations, including compact and noncompact myelin, Schwann cells, and axons, and that are involved in very different functions, which include compaction and maintenance of myelin, transport through myelin, transcription regulation associated with myelination, cell signaling, cytoskeleton formation, axonal transport, mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism, vesicle and endosomal trafficking, and chaperones. Whatever the metabolic or structural defect that primarily affects the myelin or the axon, the final common pathway in peripheral neuropathies is represented by an axonal degenerative process that, in most cases, mainly involves the largest and longest fibers [6–8]. Signals from axons determine whether or not a Schwann cell will alter its phenotype and make myelin. Alternatively, Schwann cell abnormalities may induce axonal degeneration with or without demyelination. Progress has been made toward understanding how particular mutations cause disease, but pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unknown. The PNS is a complex network of myelinated and nonmyelinated nerves of varying diameters. A myelinated nerve fiber consists of a single continuous neuronal process, the axon, surrounded along the outside by serially arranged Schwann cells, which enwrap the associated axon with their cell membrane in a multilayered specialized structure, the myelin sheath. During development, the acquisition of a myelinating phenotype by the Schwann cell appears to be in response to as yet not understood cues from the axons [9]. When the Schwann cell establishes a one-to-one association with an axon at the promyelinating stage of its development, the program of myelination is started and becomes a myelinating Schwann cell. In contrast, Schwann cells that do not establish this relationship with an axon do not activate the program of myelin gene expression and become nonmyelinating Schwann cells [10]. Interestingly, this decision process is directed by the axons, as maintenance of myelin depends on axon and axon integrity. Other example of the influence of the axons on Schwann cells is the establishment of an electrically insulate node of Ranvier. Numerous molecules mediate specific aspects of the interactions between peripheral axons and Schwann cells [11] including MAG, p75, IGF1, integrins, and TGF-β. Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1) and its receptors, the ErbB receptors tyrosine kinases, have emerged as key regulators of axon-Schwann cell interactions at every stage. Spinal cord motoneurons, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons, and autonomic neurons express Nrg1 [12], and Schwann cell express both ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors [13]. In addition to its previously known roles in proliferation and myelination, Nrg1 type III controls Schwann cell migration. Talbot's group have recently demonstrated that Nrg1 type III is an essential signal that controls Schwann cell migration to ensure that they are present in the correct numbers and positions in developing nerves [14]. Inherited demyelinating neuropathies provide examples of how the axons are also dependent on Schwann cells. The molecular studies on the progressive axonal degeneration seen in demyelinating CMT rodent models have demonstrated that they are likely to be the result of abnormalities in Schwann cell-axonal interactions [15–17].2. CMT: Inheritance and Phenotypes of Motor and Sensory Neuropathies CMT disease refers to peripheral neuropathies that affect both motor and sensory nerves. They are classically subdivided into “primary demyelinating” forms (CMT disease type 1 or CMT1), which are defined by a characteristic reduction of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and segmental demyelination and remyelination, and “primary axonal” forms (CMT2) that show preservation or mild reduction of NCVs and loss of axons, namely, those of large diameter (≥8 μm). As information about CMT2 is increasing, it has become evident that the distinction between CMT1 and CMT2 is less clear-cut than what was originally believed [18]. Diagnosis of CMT2 can be difficult; however, as many authors have noted, this type of CMT appears to have greater variability in its clinical presentation than CMT1. The CMT clinical phenotype is the consequence of a progressive axonal loss and degeneration affecting preferentially the longest axons, whatever the underlying primary pathogenic mechanism, either a myelinopathy and/or axonopathy [6, 7, 19]. CMT is predominantly a large-fibre neuropathy, but as sural nerve biopsies sometimes show, small fibres may be involved as well. In spite of the surprising variability of genes involved in the pathogenesis of CMT, common molecular pathways have been identified within Schwann cells and axons that cause these genetic neuropathies [5]. A review of some of most frequent forms is useful to define relevant clues to the pathogenesis of CMT and to sum up therapeutic interventions oriented to modulate the plasticity of these neuropathies (Figure 1).2.1. Autosomal Dominant Demyelinating Neuropathies: CMT1 Approximately 60% of CMT patients show a predominantly demyelinating peripheral neuropathy and are classified as CMT1. The main subtype is CMT1A [20, 21], accounting for 40–50% of all CMT cases, which is associated with an autosomal dominant 1.4 Mb duplication on chromosome 17p11.2 that includes the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22) [22, 23], a dosage-sensitive gene, expressed predominantly in the compact myelin of Schwann cells of the PNS. Less commonly, point mutations in PMP22 have been also associated to CMT1. The mirror mutation, that is, the 1.4 Mb deletion [24, 25], and more rarely nonsense or frameshift PMP22 mutations [26, 27] cause the myelinopathy called hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPPs) [28, 29]. Thus, duplicated or deleted of PMP22 gives rise to demyelinating neuropathies and secondary axonal loss or abnormalities by a mechanism of gene dosage. When overexpressed in cultured cells or in transgenic mice overexpressing the human gene, PMP22 reaches late endosomes and forms protein aggregates that are ubiquitinated [30]. Removal of preexisting aggresomes formed by endogenous PMP22 is aided by autophagy [31]. A second cellular mechanism that can influence protein aggregation is the heat shock response. In proteasome-inhibited cells, overexpressed wild-type and mutant PMP22, as well as the spontaneous aggregates in neuropathic mouse nerves, recruits heat shock proteins [31]. The formation of aggresomes is a protective response of the cell that concentrates misfolded proteins in a central location to activate an autophagic response [32]. Fortun et al. propose a protective role for chaperones in preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Elevated PMP22 expression might perturb Schwann cell function by interfering with the intracellular sorting of PMP22 and other proteins, leading to overloading of the protein degradation machinery. Although demyelination is the pathological and physiological hallmark of CMT1A, the clinical signs and symptoms of this disease, progressive weakness, and sensory loss are produced by axonal degeneration [6]. The characteristic features of the PMP22 mutant Trembler and Trembler-J mice [33], particularly the minimal or abnormal myelination and reduced axonal diameter, have made them very attractive models to define the mechanisms by which defective peripheral myelination can modify axonal properties. CMT1B is caused by mutations in the major myelin protein zero gene (MPZ), which comprises approximately 50% of myelin protein, and is necessary for both normal myelin structure and function [34, 35]. To date there are more than 150 different mutations in MPZ known to cause CMT1B in patients, which include missense, nonsense, small insertion/deletion, and splice site mutations. Based on clinical studies, Shy and coworkers' [36] patients fall into two distinct phenotype groups: one causing delayed motor development and marked slow nerve conduction and a second one usually associated with late-onset neuropathy, which allows developmental myelination, but eventually leads to axonal degeneration with minimal evidence of demyelination. It is difficult to make genotype-phenotype correlations because mutations in MPZ impair the adhesive function of myelin protein zero (P0), its subcellular trafficking, or both. Either abnormal gain-of-function effects (toxicity of misfolded protein) or reduced amounts of P0 (haploinsufficiency) could, therefore, underlie the clinical phenotype [37]. Pennuto and collaborators demonstrated that the unfolded protein response (UPR) activated by overload of misfolded proteins in the ER was responsible for demyelination in a CMT1B mouse model [38]. A recent work has identified that an increased gene dosage of MPZ is directly involved in the pathogenesis of human peripheral nerves [39].2.2. Autosomal Dominant Axonal Neuropathies: CMT2 CMT2 has a highly heterogeneous genotype. Mutations in the mitofusin 2 gene (MFN2) cause CMT2A and account for about 20% of CMT2 cases. Other less frequently mutated genes are MPZ (CMT2J), which also causes CMT1B, and the neurofilament light chain gene (NEFL) [40, 41]. CMT2A MFN2 participates in the fusion pathway of the mitochondrial dynamics [42, 43] and is also involved in the relationship of mitochondria with endoplasmic reticulum (ER); furthermore, depletion of MFN2 causes a disruption of mitochondrial dynamics and abnormalities in Ca2+ homeostasis [44]. Mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of CMT2A associated with MFN2 dysfunctions include a defect in mitochondrial fusion, leading to a loss of mtDNA, and impairment in oxidative phosphorylation and cell bioenergetics [45]. Current models propose that a mitochondrial transport defect could be the cause of CMT2A. Zhao et al. were the first to link axonal cargo transport dysfunction to CMT2A [46]. Based on several studies [47, 48], it is tempting to speculate that MFN2 could be part of a motor complex involved in anterograde movement of mitochondria. So far, two transgenic mouse models expressing pathogenic mutations have been generating, Mfn2T105M [49] and Mfn2R94Q [50]. Loss of MFN2 profoundly and selectively disrupts axonal mitochondrial transport [51], which indicates its integral role in the regulation of mitochondrial transport, and the important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of CMT2A. To date, up to 18 neurofilament light (NEFL) mutations have been associated with axonal CMT2E [52, 53]. A conditional mouse model, carrying the P22S mutation, mimics many aspects of the human CMT2E disease, including motor disability, abnormal muscle morphology, and denervation events [54]. These results highlight the importance of the integrity of the neurofilament network for neuronal function and suggest that the disease symptoms caused by the NEFLP22S mutation might result from axonal transport defects rather than deleterious effects of large neurofilament aggregates.2.3. X-Linked CMT With a frequency of about 10%, CMTX1 [55] is the second most common inherited neuropathy. CMTX1 is genetically defined by mutations in the gene GJB1, which encodes the gap junction protein connexin-32 (Cx32) on the Xq13 chromosome [56]. Cx32 is localized in the noncompacted myelin sheath of large diameter fibers, forming the functional channels that allow for the rapid transport of ions and small nutrients between coupled cells [37]. Although Cx32 expression is not limited to the peripheral nervous system (it is also expressed by white matter oligodendrocytes), Cx32 mutations are associated only with CMT [57]. So far, more than 270 mutations that alter the structure of Cx32 have been reported, and most of these probably cause a partial or complete loss of function. Cx32-deficient mice have prominent adaxonal changes at the ultrastructural level, and a similar pathomechanism is observed in humans [58].2.4. Autosomal Recessive CMT: Demyelinating CMT4 and Axonal AR-CMT2 Variants In 2002, Baxter et al. [59] and Cuesta et al. [60] demonstrated that mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein-1 (GDAP1) gene cause autosomal recessive CMT neuropathy. This finding was fascinating, as the two reports differed markedly with respect to the phenotypes of their families. Cuesta et al. described families who had an axonal phenotype (AR-CMT2K), whereas Baxter's families showed a demyelinating phenotype (CMT4A). Both slow and normal NCVs have been reported in patients, and many of the cases show a severe phenotype and have their onset in childhood. However, mild forms segregating as an autosomal dominant phenotype have also been reported [61]. Mutations have been described in every exon and include missense, nonsense, splicing site, short deletions, and insertion mutations. GDAP1 belongs to a glutathione S-transferase enzyme subfamily [62] that is mainly expressed in neurons [63, 64] but also in Schwann cells [65]. GDAP1 is a mitochondrial protein [63] located in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) acting as a regulator of mitochondrial dynamics [65, 66]. The effect of GDAP1 mutations in mitodynamics seems to depend on the inheritance pattern [67]. Overexpression of GDAP1 in COS7 or HeLa cells causes mitochondrial fragmentation or fission and a substantial accumulation of mitochondria around the nucleus. Rescue experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective mutans for fission and fusion genes have shown that GDAP1 rescues the phenotype of the fission-associated gene Fis1. In particular, the recovery of G2/M delay suggests that both Fis1p and GDAP1 may affect the interaction of mitochondria with microtubules [68], an aspect that may relate GDAP1 to mitochondrial transport or movement in axons. CMT4C neuropathy, which is caused by mutations in the SH3TC2 gene, is the most common cause of the autosomal recessive form of demyelinating CMT. SH3TC2 is specifically expressed in Schwann cells and is necessary for proper myelination of peripheral axons. Analysis of the murine model of CMT4C revealed that the capacity of SH3TC2-deficient Schwann cells to properly myelinate underlying axons is affected at the early stages of myelination, which is in line with the early onset of the neuropathy reported in CMT4C patients [69–71]. However, its exact role in myelin biology remains to be determined. Recent data demonstrated that SH3TC2 localizes at the plasma membrane and in endocytic vesicles [72–74] and that it interacts with the small GTPase Rab11, which is known to regulate the recycling of internalized membranes and receptors back to the plasma membrane. Further protein binding studies and transferrin receptor trafficking assays revealed that SH3TC2 together with Rab11 indeed affect the dynamics of endocytic recycling [75].3. Cellular and Molecular Bases of Nerve Regeneration and Plasticity in CMT Neuropathies The discovery of many genes involved in CMT disease has provided a unique opportunity to understand the critical molecular pathways involved in peripheral axon stability and length-dependent peripheral nerve disease [17, 18]. An important concept in peripheral neuropathy is that many types are characteristically length dependent; that is, the longest axons in the body are affected first and most profoundly. The length-dependent distribution supports the concept that the major site of pathology is in the axon itself, rather than the cell body. Furthermore, it suggests that shorter axons are either less susceptible or better able to compensate for certain insults that are longer axons, leading to the degeneration of the distal regions of the longest axons first [76]. Peripheral neuropathies presenting a distal nonterminal axonopathy represent the most common nerve diseases. Their long-term outcome depends on the balance of two processes: the degree or rate of axonal degeneration and the ability of the nascent axon tips to regenerate efficiently. One strategy to alter these processes would be to improve the efficiency of regeneration by using trophic factors such as neurotrophins [77], moving them from bench-to bedside. Prolonged denervation could lead to decreased regeneration capacity because of reduction in the expression of regeneration-associated Schwann cell molecules, such as neurotrophic factors and receptors. Therefore, Schwann cells might remain in a growth-supportive mode for prolonged periods or they have to be transformed into a competent premyelinating state to initiate and complete myelination. The functional significance of regeneration is to allow reinnervation of target organs and restitution of their corresponding functions. The materials for axonal growth are mainly provided by the cell body via axonal transport [78, 79], but more recently the contribution of local axonal synthesis and degradation of proteins has been identified [80, 81]. Increased energy demands on the neuron to propagate action potentials, and decreased trophic factor support from denervated Schwann cells or muscle are other potential mechanisms that may also contribute to axonal degeneration in demyelinating neuropathies (reviewed in [16]). An unanswered question with respect to all CMT1 forms is why mutant Schwann cells fail to support axonal function and survival [37]. An important direction is the development of therapeutic strategies that enhance axonal regeneration and promote selective target reinnervation; in addition, modulation of the central nervous system reorganization to improve functional recovery but also diminishing undesirable consequences has been proposed as well [82].4. CMT Pharmacological and Biological Therapies CMT disease course and severity vary according to CMT type, causative gene, and mutation change, but considerable phenotypic variability may occur also within the same CMT type. Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of inherited neuropathies is essential for the development of rational therapies (Figure 1). While much remains to be learned, it is clear that most are caused by the expression of a mutant allele(s) in myelinating Schwann cells or neurons. For recessive neuropathies, in principle it is possible to “replace” the defective gene by introducing a normal version. For dominant neuropathies, the situation is even more complex, as these are likely to be caused by a toxic gain of function that is not necessarily related to the normal function of the gene product. Nevertheless, for dominant demyelinating neuropathies caused by altered gene dosage, reestablishing the normal level of gene expression might be of benefit. The pathogenic mechanism in CMT1A duplication is attributed to an excess gene copy number of PMP22, leading to protein overexpression [28], and factors that modify the expression levels of PMP22 might potentially be effective for treatment. A proof of concept that demyelination can be reversed by normalizing expression of PMP22 was provided through a transgenic mouse model [83]. Research is focused on developing new treatment strategies to target the regulation of PMP22 gene dosage. Two compounds that have been shown to alter PMP22 mRNA levels in rodents are ascorbic acid and progesterone and progesterone antagonists. Ascorbic acid reduced the severity of neuropathy in transgenic mice overexpressing PMP22, an animal model of human CMT1A, compared with untreated mice [84]. Ascorbic acid promotes myelination in vitro and decreases PMP22 mRNA levels through a cAMP-mediated pathway [84, 85]. Evidence of efficacy of ascorbic acid in the animal model prompted initiation of randomized controlled trials to test the efficacy of ascorbic acid in patients with CMT1A. Results from a phase 3, multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial to assess the efficacy and tolerability of chronic ascorbic acid treatment in patients with CMT1A in Italy and the UK have been just published [86]. Unfortunately, ascorbic acid supplementation had no significant effect on neuropathy compared to placebo after 2 years followup, suggesting that no evidence is available to support treatment with ascorbic acid in adults with CMT1A. It is known that progesterone and derivates are able to increase MPZ and PMP22 gene expression in vitro [87]. In order to test if progesterone can modulate the progressive neuropathy caused by moderate overexpression of PMP22, Sereda and collaborators [88] administrated daily subcutaneous injections of progesterone and the progesterone antagonist, onapristone, to a transgenic rat model of CMT1A during 7 weeks and showed that onapristone reduced PMP22 mRNA by 15%, resulting in clinical and neuropathological improvement. A long-term study reaffirmed these results and shed light to the axonal degeneration process seen in CMT1A patients, by reducing progressive muscle atrophy and preventing axonal loss without altering myelin sheath thickness [89]. Unfortunately, onapristone and currently available progesterone antagonists are too toxic to be safely administered to CMT1A patients, so further research is ongoing to develop suitable compounds for future clinical trials. To accomplish this goal, the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association (CMTA) has established the Strategy to Accelerate Research (STAR) to specifically fund CMT-related research (http://www.cmtausa.org/). High-throughput screens are trying to identify compounds that are already FDA approved, so it could accelerate the drug development process and start phase III clinical trials in 3–5 years. Another interesting and promising molecule is curcumin, which plays a role stimulating the translocation of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, thereby reducing cytotoxicity of the mutant proteins. This mechanism might be helpful for selected CMT1A and CMT1B forms, in which various PMP22 and MPZ mutations are known to cause intracellular accumulation of mutant proteins. Oral curcumin mitigates the clinical and neuropathologic phenotype of Trembler-J mouse model of CMT1A, inhibiting Schwann cell apoptosis and increasing axonal caliber and myelin thickness. Furthermore, this positive clinical response to curcumin occurs in a dose-dependent manner and is reversed after withdrawal of treatment without side effects. Recent cell-based studies showed that mutant P0 could accumulate in the ER and induce apoptosis. This aggregation-induced apoptosis was abrogated by pretreatment with curcumin [90]. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role of curcumin in selected forms of inherited peripheral neuropathies. There is also evidence that MPZ mutations with ER-retention of the mutated protein cause UPR activation rather than apoptosis [38] so this mechanism could also be relevant as a therapeutic target. Regarding axonal CMT, in a transgenic mouse model for mutant HSBP1-induced CMT2 and distal HMN type 2B [91], mutant HSBP1, also known as HSP27, leads to severe axonal transport defects induced by a decrease in acetylated tubulin abundance in peripheral nerves. The phenotype was partially restored and the axonal transport defects were rescued when mice were treated with HDAC6 inhibitors. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is the major enzyme with α-tubulin deacetylating activity. For this study the authors used a nonspecific inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), and two highly selective inhibitors: tubacin and tubastatin A, which resulted to be more effective compared to TSA when axonal transport and CMT phenotype were assessed. As some HDAC6 inhibitors have entered into clinical trials for cancer treatment and other neurological disorders such as Friedreich's ataxia [92], it is rationale to think that the same drug approach could be tested in CMT patients. Schwann cell pathology damages the delicate myelin-axon interaction and can lead to axonal degeneration [6], but pronounced axonal pathology has also been observed even in genetic models in which axons are associated with normal appearing myelin sheaths. Thus, a therapeutic approach focusing on preventing this intimate connection could be providing trophic factor support to degenerating axons, which may be useful for a number of CMT neuropathies, either primary myelinopathies or primary axonopathies. The main conceptual problem with this approach is the diversity of trophic factors and PNS neurons, especially because different kinds of neurons respond to different trophic factors [16]. Only neurons with the proper receptors typically respond to a given growth factor. Receptor-mediated, retrograde axonal transport delivers the trophic factor to neuronal cell bodies, where they act. Axonal elongation requires an adequate substrate of trophins and tropic factors, provided by reactive Schwann cells and the extracellular matrix within the degenerated nerve [93]. Another potentially approach involves the manipulation of Schwann cell-axonal signal transduction pathways. Neuregulin-1 enhances axonal regeneration [94] by acting on Schwann cells as PNS neurons do not express neuregulin receptors. Axons express neuregulin-1 type III (Nrg1-III) on their surface, which binds to ErbB receptors on Schwann cells as part of a process that initiates myelination. Therefore, Nrg1-III acts as a juxtacrine signal. Nrg1-III binds to ErbB3 and promotes ErbB2 phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of both ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors [95]. Activation of the ErbB receptors leads to signaling through multiple signaling cascades including PI3K/Akt, Erk1/2, JNK, and FAK [96]. Three families of trophic factors are particularly important for PNS neurons: the neurotrophin family, the glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) family of cytokines. Sahenk and collaborators studied the ability of mutant Schwann cells to respond to exogenous neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in two CMT1A animal models [97]. NT-3-treated animals presented improved nerve regeneration and the associated myelination process. Furthermore, at the early stages of regeneration-associated myelination, NT-3 stabilizes the axonal cytoskeleton locally by inducing neurofilament phosphorylation when axon sprouts become enwrapped by Schwann cells [77]. In contrast, BDNF, which belongs to the neurotrophin family but is not part of the Schwann cell survival loop [98], showed no effect upon axonal growth or cytoskeletal neurofilament pathology. Unfortunately, despite the promising results in animal studies, no studies have been successful in humans, probably due to a poor delivery and short half-lives of the trophic and growth factors. Targeting the correct combination of trophic factors to neurons or Schwann cells at the optimal time may be necessary to achieve meaningful results. A combination of trophic factors or engineered “pan-neurotrophic factors” [99] might be more beneficial than a single factor. The short half-life of most neurotrophic factors would require either multiple administrations or a continuous infusion of the therapeutic molecules in order to achieve an adequate and effective local concentration. Knowing the molecular basis of inherited diseases prompts immediate consideration of gene therapy. Gene therapy can be defined as a strategy to transfer biologically relevant genetic material (usually mutant genes or genes delivering trophic and growth factors) into affected cells in the body to treat disease. For instance, delivering neurotrophic factors to the healing nerve ends, favoring survival and regeneration of both sensory and motor axons, could, ultimately, allow the recovery of nervous functions [100]. Viral vectors and plasmid DNA have been widely used for treating human disease models and patients. Expression of the gene might be modulated by the introduction of regulatory elements for the controlled or tissue-specific expression of the desired molecule. Until now, three major classes of viral vectors, based on adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV), have been exploited to target the PNS. Although not originally neurotropic, adenoviral and AAV vectors are able to transduce spinal sensory and motor neurons after either intramuscular or intraneural injections. When injected at the site of a nerve injury, these vectors are retrogradely transported to motor neuron cell bodies and can thus be exploited to deliver therapeutic genes along the route of the nerve. However, the strong absorption of both adenoviral and AAV vectors to skeletal muscle fibers might represent a limitation for efficient neuronal transduction and retrograde transport [101]. A recent study in mice has characterized the tropism and transduction efficiency of different AAV pseudotypes after sciatic nerve injection. Among the pseudotypes tested, AAV2/1 transduced both Schwann cells and neurons, AAV2/2 infected only sensory neurons, and AAV2/8 preferentially transduced Schwann cells, proving the utility of AAVs as gene therapy vectors [102]. A few approaches have used plasmids as vehicles to deliver therapeutic genes to peripheral nerves. In these cases, the skeletal muscle has been the preferred site for delivery and expression of the transgene. For instance, intramuscular delivery of a plasmid encoding for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) showed a protective role against myelin wasting and axonal loss [103]. Viral vectors have been modified so that they are unable to cause disease. Unfortunately, they have caused immunologic reactions, which currently limit their use. In contrast, plasmid DNA is nonimmunogenic, but it is characterized by poor delivery efficiency, and proteins made from it have only been produced in target organs for a short time. Progress in this area demands more sophisticated delivery systems and more knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of neuropathies. Schwann cells, and their basal lamina, represent the key component of nerve regeneration, as they serve as scaffolds for the regenerating axons, which grow through the empty basal lamina tubes. Schwann cells, however, have limited clinical applications since the culture of an adequate quantity of cells to achieve optimal conditions for transplantation in nerve conduits is time consuming and requires particular care for in vitro expansion and a constant input of growth factors. Moreover, Schwann cells are not easily accessible without nerve biopsy and bear the need to sacrifice an autologous nerve, with the related complications. Due to all these difficulties, the field of stem cell therapy for peripheral neuropathies has been explored. Adult stem cells show ability to differentiate into neuroprogenitor-type cells [104, 105]. Stem cells could be differentiating into neurons, which will generate new axons to contact their targets or Schwann cells enwrapping demyelinating axons and secreting trophic factors. Bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be induced to differentiate into Schwann cells [106], improving myelin formation and nerve regeneration in vivo after their transplantation into different models of peripheral nerve injury [107, 108]. Adipose tissue has been also indicated as a novel and promising source of multipotent cells (adipose-derived stem cells, ASCs), which can be differentiated into a neuronal phenotype [109, 110], and in terms of clinical use, they may be harvested by conventional liposuction procedure under local anaesthesia. The frequency of stem cells in adipose tissue is 100- to 1000-fold higher than that in bone marrow, which is a considerable advantage as it reduces the period of expansion of the stem cells prior to differentiation. Terenghi's group showed how ASCs could be differentiated towards a Schwann cell-like phenotype, expressing markers like S-100, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and P75 neurotrophin receptor and enhancing neurite outgrowth in an in vitro co-culture model [111]. More recently, expression of myelin proteins P0 and PMP22 after differentiation of both ASC and MSC [112] and the neurotrophic potential shown in vitro from differentiated adipose-derived stem cells (dASCs) with a brief term in vivo study have been described [113].5. Conclusions Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a generalized disorder of motor and sensory peripheral nerves. Three major points deserve attention: (1) disease pathophysiology of both myelinopathies and axonopathies forms are the consequence of altered Schwann cell-axon communication; abnormal intercellular contact and signaling induce neurodegeneration and axonal loss, which ultimate produce muscular atrophy and weakness, (2) the primary cause is the genetic mutation in any of the more than 40 genes causing CMT or related neuropathies, and (3) a major therapeutic target is the regeneration of cell viability based on improving myelin and axon interaction. Therapies promoting plasticity changes in axons and Schwann cells require not only new therapeutic drug, gene, or cell approaches but also proper delivery systems targeted to the pathological cellular structures.

The transformed products, which showed significant immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory activities, can be further studied for their potential as novel drugs. Background Microbial regio- and stereo-selective transformations of steroids have been extensively investigated [1,2]. We have been studying microbial transformation of bioactive steroids with the objectives of producing their novel metabolites and understanding their metabolism [3-8]. Oxymetholone [17β-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethylene)-17α-methyl-5α-androstan-3-one, C21H32O3 (1), a 17α-alkylated anabolic-androgenic steroid, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of blood anemia, osteoporosis, HIV-associated wasting, antithrombin III deficiency, pediatric growth impairment, and damaged myocardium; as well as for stimulating muscle growth in malnourished, and underdeveloped individuals. However, it is also been abused by some athletes for enhancing muscle mass and strength [9,10]. Compound 1 also known to exhibit immunosuppressant activity in vivo by decreasing the activity of T-cells [11]. During current study, compound 1 was found to exhibit significant immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro in T-cell proliferation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production assay, respectively. T-Lymphocytes play a key role in cell mediated immune response by activating various T-cells and modulating autoimmune response. Thus inhibition of T-cell proliferation can serve as an approach to treat various immune disorders [12], including organ rejection after transplant [13]. The immune system also utilizes various cellular processes for elimination of pathogens, such as phagocytosis which involves elimination of pathogens by enzyme catalyzed oxidative burst. Ironically prolonged overproduction of ROS can damage body’s own cells and tissues, and lead to chronic inflammation and other autoimmune diseases [14]. Based on these preliminary findings, we investigated biotransformation of 1 to obtain new analogues. Preliminary experiments showed that Macrophomina phaseolina, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, and Fusarium lini can efficiently transform 1 into several metabolites. Subsequent large scale fermentation was carried out and four new metabolites 2–5, along with two known metabolites 6 and 7 were obtained. The structures of new metabolites were unambiguously deduced through 1D- and 2D-NMR and by single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. Metabolites 2–7 were then evaluated for the inhibition of T-cell proliferation (IC50 values in the range of 31.2 to 2.7 μg/mL), and ROS production (1 and 2 had a strong inhibition (IC50 = 2 to 2.3 μg/mL)), representing their immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory potential.Results and discussionStructure elucidation of metabolites Incubation of oxymetholone (1) (C21H32O3) with Macrophomina phaseolina, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer and Fusarium lini produced six metabolites 27 (Figure 1). Metabolites 6 and 7 were previously obtained through chemical hydrogenation of 1[15], however this is the first report of their biomimetic synthesis. The structures of new metabolites 25 were unambiguously deduced largely by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Figure 1 Biotransformation of oxymetholone(1)by Macrophomina phaseolina (compounds 2, 3, 6, 7), Aspergillus niger (compounds 6, 7), Rhizopus stolonifer (compounds 3, 6)and Fusarium lini (compounds 2, 4, 5). The HREI-MS M+ = m/z 332.2333 (calcd 332.2351) (C21H32O3)], IR (1666 cm-1) and UV (236.4 nm) spectra of 2 suggested the C = C isomerization of 1 into 2[8,16]. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (Table 1) showed a new olefinic methine H/C signal at δ 6.48/δ 152.4, along with a hydroxyl-bearing methylene H2/C at δ 4.78 and 4.76 (J21a,b = 15.0 Hz)/δ 59.8 for HC-1 and H2C-21, respectively. Me (19) protons (δ 0.96) were correlated with C-1 (δ 152.4) in HMBC, while C-21 protons (δ 4.78, 4.76) were correlated with C-1 (δ 152.4) and C-2 (δ 137.5). Additionally, C-1 (δ 6.48) and C-4 protons (δ 2.47, 2.26) were also correlated with C-3 (δ 199.0), and C-2 (δ 137.5) C-1 Proton also showed HMBC correlations with C-21 (δ 59.8). The structure of new metabolite 2 was finally deduced through single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques (Figure 2). The asymmetric unit contains two independent molecules of metabolite 2. The ORTEP diagrams of 2 (Figure 2) showed four trans fused rings A, B, C, and D with half chair/chair/chair, and envelop conformations, respectively. C-17 -OH and methyl groups exist in pseudoequatorial and pseudoaxial orientations, respectively. The shorter bond lengths of C-2—C-3 single-bond (1.476(8) Å) is due to the conjugation of C-1—C-2 (1.321(7) Å) olefinic bond with the C-3 carbonyl moiety. All bond angles and lengths were within the normal range.

The UV inactive metabolite 3 showed molecular ion (M+) at m/z 352.2643 (calcd 352.2613), in agreement with the formula C21H36O4, indicating reduction of C = C bond and addition of any oxygen. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra of 3 (Table 1) showed two pairs of downfield OH-bearing methylene H2/C signals at δ 4.09, 3.82 (d, J20a,b = 10.3 Hz)/δ 67.3 (H2C-20) and 4.17, 4.03 (m)/δ 66.1 (H2C-21), along with an OH-bearing methine H/C at δ 4.51 (br. s, W1/2 = 12.0 Hz)/δ 67.6 (HC-3). The H2C-21 (δ 4.17, 4.03) and HC-3 (δ 4.51) both showed COSY correlations with the vicinal HC-2 (δ 1.98). Moreover, C-21 protons showed HMBC correlations with C-1 (δ 36.5), C-2 (δ 40.5) and C-3 (δ 67.6) (Figure 3a). Similarly, C-20 methylene protons at δ 4.09, 3.82 exhibited HMBC interactions with C-13 (δ 46.1), C-16 (δ 34.1), and C-17 (δ 83.2). Stereochemistry at C-2 and C-3 was deduced from the NOE correlations of HC-2 (δ 1.98) with Me-19 (δ 0.87), and HC-3 (δ 4.51) with HC-5 (δ 2.01) (Figure 3b). On the basis of above observations, the new metabolite was characterized as 2α,17α-di(hydroxymethyl)-5α-androstan-3β-17β-diol (3). Figure 3 Important (a) HMBC, and (b) NOESY correlations in metabolite 3. The formula C20H34O3 for 4 (M+ = m/z 322.2507, calcd 322.2508) indicated four double bond equivalents and loss of oxidative carbon. The UV and IR spectra indicated the absence of enone functionality. The 1H- and 13C-NMR (Table 1) of metabolite 4 was substantially different from that of the substrate 1, first due to the lack of HC-21 olefinic methine signal, and second the appearance of two new hydroxyl-bearing methine H/C signals at δ 4.05 (m, W1/2 = 20.6 Hz)/δ 73.1 and 3.87 (m, W1/2 = 20.6 Hz)/δ 76.7. Vicinal correlations between H2C-1 (δ 2.27, 1.30), HC-2 (δ 4.05), HC-3 (δ 3.87) and H2C-4 (δ 1.88, 1.72) in the COSY 45° spectrum indicated the oxidative loss of C-21 methine. HC-2 (δ 4.05) and HC-3 (δ 3.87) were also correlated to C-1 (δ 46.5), C-4 (δ 37.2), C-5 (δ 45.4), and C-10 (δ 37.6) in the HMBC spectrum. The structure of new metabolite 4 was unambiguously established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis as half water solvate (Figure 4). It showed four trans fused rings A, B, C, and D exist in chair/ chair/chair, and envelop conformations, respectively. The C-2 and C-3 vicinal diols adopt equatorial orientations, whereas hydroxyl and methyl substituents at C-17 were found in pseudoequatorial and pseudoaxial orientations, respectively. All bond angles and lengths were in agreement with other related steroidal structures [8]. Figure 4 Computer-generated ORTEP diagram of metabolite 4 (Hydrogens are omitted for clarity). The molecular composition C21H30O3 was deduced from the HREI-MS of metabolite 5 (M+ = m/z 330.2183, calcd 330.2195), which was 2 amu less than the metabolite 2. The UV spectrum of 5 exhibited a λmax at 249.8 nm due to extended conjugation in ring A. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (Table 1) of metabolite 5 was distinctly similar to 2, indicating the presence of two olefinic H/C at δ 7.45 (s)/δ 150.0 (HC-1) and 6.28 (d, J = 1.0 Hz)/δ 124.0 (HC-4) in ring A, along with hydroxy-methylene H2/C signals at δ 5.06, 4.98 (m)/δ 59.5 (H2C-21). The methine signals δ 6.28/δ 124.0 and methylene signals δ 5.06, 4.98/δ 59.5 showed similar HMBC correlations as those of HC-1 and H2C-21 for metabolite 2. Similarly, C-4 proton (δ 6.28) was correlated to C-3 (δ 186.0), C-5 (δ 169.4), C-6 (δ 32.5) and C-10 (δ 43.5) in HMBC spectrum. The structure of metabolite 5 was unambiguously deduced by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies (Figure 5). The asymmetric unit contains two water solvated independent molecules of metabolite 5. The ORTEP diagrams (Figure 5) showed that compound 5 is consisting of four fused rings A , B, C and D. Trans fused rings B, C and D adopt chair/chair and envelop conformations, respectively, with the pseudo equatorial orientation of hydroxyl substituent at C-17. Ring A was found to be planner in geometry due to extended conjugation. All the bond angles and lengths were within the normal range as observed in previously reported steroids [8]. Figure 5 Computer-generated ORTEP diagram of metabolite 5(Hydrogens are omitted for clarity). The structure of known metabolite 6 was unambiguously deduced through single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. ORTEP diagrams (Figure 6) showed that it consists of trans fused rings A, B, C, and D with chair/chair/chair and envelop conformations, respectively. The hydroxymethylene moiety attached to C-2, and OH at C-17 were found in equatorial and peudo equatorial orientations, respectively. All the bond angles and lengths were found within normal range. Known metabolite 7 was structurally identified by comparing of its spectral data with the one reported earlier. Figure 6 Computer-generated ORTEP diagram of metabolite 6(Hydrogens are omitted for clarity).T-Cell proliferation inhibitory activity Oxymetholone (1) is known to modulate cell-mediated immunity in vivo. This was in part due to a decrease in T-cell activity [5]. This initial observation prompted us to investigate the T-cell proliferation inhibitory potential of 1 and its metabolites. Compounds 1–7 were evaluated for their effect on T-cell proliferation by employing PHA to activate human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC), isolated from the blood sample from healthy human volunteers. The results indicate that metabolite 6 possess more potent T-cell proliferation inhibitory activity (IC50 = 2.7 μg/mL), as compared to the substrate 1 (IC50 = 7.5 μg/mL) and standard prednisolone (IC50 < 3.1 μg/ mL) (Table 2, Figure 7); whereas compounds 7 and 4 showed a moderate inhibitory activity (IC50 = 10.6 ± 0.4 and 11.8 ± 0.9 μg/mL, respectively). Compounds 2–5 showed a weak inhibition of T-cell proliferation as compared to compounds mentioned earlier. Limited SAR indicated that greater flexibility in ring A, due to reduction of C = C or C = O bonds probably contributes in activity.

Each bar represents the mean value of triplicate reading ± SD.ROS inhibition activity Compounds 1–7 were also investigated for their effect on ROS production by using whole blood and professional phagocytic PMNs and the detecting probes luminal (Table 3, Figures 8 and 9). Compound 2 showed slightly stronger (p ≤ 0.005) inhibition (IC50 = 2.0 μg/mL) as compared to 1 (IC50 = 2.3 μg/mL). Both compounds were at least five fold more active than the standard ibuprofen (IC50 = 11.2 μg/mL) in whole blood phagocytes. Metabolite 7 showed a moderate inhibitory activity (IC50 = 25.6 μg/mL), while other compounds did not show any activity even at the highest concentration (100 μg/mL). Compounds which showed potent inhibitory activities were further evaluated by using professional phagocytes PMNs. Compound 1 showed a significant inhibition of ROS generation in the PMNs (IC50 = 6.3 μg/mL). Interestingly ROS generation inhibitory activity of compound 1 and its known metabolites 6 and 7 have not been studied before.

Each plot and error bar represents reading ± SD of three repeats.Cytotoxicity Compounds 1–7 were found to be non-toxic towards the normal mouse fibroblast (3T3) cells, even at the highest concentrations tested (100 μg/mL).Conclusions Our study provides an efficient method for the production of new anabolic steroids by the structural transformation of oxymetholone (1) by using fungi. The procedure presented here can also be used for the study of the metabolism of oxymetholone (1), as well as for the production of potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory drugs. In the current study, compounds 2–7 found to posses a strong inhibitory effect on T-cell proliferation, with IC50 values between 31.2 to 2.7 μg/mL, while in case of the ROS production, only compounds 1 and 2 exerted significant inhibition (IC50 ~ 2.0 μg/mL) on whole blood phagocytes. Whereas only 1 showed significant ROS inhibition (IC50 = 6.3 μg/mL) on the isolated PMNs.ExperimentalGeneral experimental conditions Silica gel precoated plates (Merck, PF254; 20 × 20, 0.25 mm, Germany) were used for the TLC based separation. Silica gel (70–230 mesh, Merck) was used for column chromatography. Melting points were determined with a Buchi-535, apparatus and are uncorrected. Optical rotations were measured in methanol with a JASCO P-2000 polarimeter. UV Spectra (in nm) were recorded in methanol with a Hitachi U-3200 spectrophotometer. Infrared (IR) spectra (in cm-1) were recorded with an FT-IR-8900 spectrophotometer. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded in C5D5N on a Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer, with residual solvent signal as the internal standard. Standard Bruker pulse sequences were used for 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments. The chemical shifts (δ values) are reported in parts per million (ppm), relative to TMS at 0 ppm. The coupling constants (J values) are reported in Hertz. Electron impact (EI-MS), and high-resolution mass spectra (HREI-MS) were recorded on JEOL JMS-600H mass spectrometer (Japan); in m/z (rel.%). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker Smart APEX II diffractometer with CCD detector [17]. Data reductions were performed by using SAINT program. The structures were solved by direct methods [18], and refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 by using the SHELXTL-PC package [19]. The figures were plotted with the aid of ORTEP program [20]. The luminometer used was from Luminoskan RS (Labsystem Luminoskan, Helsinki, Finland), and cell harvester and glass fiber filters used were from Inotech (Dottikon, Swetzerland). Liquid scintillation counter used was LS65000 from Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, CA, USA). Microplate reader used was SpectraMax (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). The chemicals and reagents were purchased from the following sources: Oxymetholone (1) (TCI, Japan), Luminol (Research Organics, OH, USA), Hanks balance salts solution (HBSS), phytohemagglutinin-L (PHA-L), penicillin, and streptomycin (Sigma,St. Louis, USA), lymphocytes separation medium (LSM) (MP Biomedicals, Illkirch, France), zymosan-A (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (Fluka BioChemika, Buchs, Switzerland), tritiated thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Amresco, Solon, OH, USA). Tissue culture plates were obtained from Iwaki (Japan). Mouse fibroblasts (3T3) were obtained from the European American Culture Collection (EACC). Dulbcco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Gibco-BRL (Grand Island, NY, USA).Microorganisms and culture medium The fungi were obtained either from the Northern Regional Research Laboratories (NRRL), or Karachi University Culture Collection (KUCC) or American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Macrophomina phaseolina (KUCC 730) and Fusarium lini (NRRL 2204) were grown in a medium composed of the following ingredients and dissolved in distilled H2O (4.0 L): glucose (40.0 g), glycerol (40.0 mL), peptone (20.0 g), yeast extract (20.0 g), KH2PO4 (20.0 g), and NaCl (20.0 g). The media (2.0 L) for Aspergillus niger (ATCC 10549), and Rhizopus stolonifer (ATCC 10404) were the same as above, except addition of glycerol (10.0 mL) for A. niger and yeast extract (6.0 g) for R. stolonifer.General fermentation and extraction conditions The fungal medium was distributed into 250 mL conical flasks (100 mL each) and autoclaved at 121°C. Mycelia of the fungi were transferred to flasks and incubated at 26 ± 2°C for two-three days on rotary shaking (120 rpm). Compound 1, dissolved in acetone, was evenly distributed among all the flasks which were placed on the rotary shaker (120 rpm) at 26 ± 2°C for fermentation. Parallel control experiments were conducted which included an incubation of the fungus without substrate 1, and an incubation of 1 in the medium without fungus. The degree of transformation was analyzed on TLC after one day. The culture medium and mycelium were separated by filtration. The mycelium was washed with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, 1.0 L). The aqueous filtrate was extracted with CH2Cl2 (4 L × 3). The CH2Cl2 extract was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, evaporated under reduced pressures, and the resulting brown gum was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. The control flasks were also harvested in the same manner, and compared with the test to assure the presence of biotransformed products.Fermentation of oxymetholone (1) with Macrophomina phaseolina Oxymetholone (1; 800 mg) was dissolved in 20 mL acetone, and uniformly distributed to 40 flasks containing 2 days old M. phaseolina culture. Fermentation was carried out for twelve days. The gummy material (2.5 g), obtained after filtration, extraction and evaporation, was loaded onto a silica gel column for fractionation. The mobile phase was composed of pet. ether and acetone with a gradient of 10%. Three main fractions (OX-1 − 3) were obtained on the basis of TLC analysis. Fraction OX-1 yielded metabolites 2 (07 mg) and 6 (43 mg) on elution from silica gel column (pet. ether: acetone = 9:1), while OX-2, when subjected to silica gel column chromatography, yielded metabolite 7 (21 mg, pet. ether: acetone = 8:2). Fraction OX-3 yielded metabolite 3 (276 mg, pet. ether: acetone = 7:3) after elution from silica gel column.17β-Hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-17α-methyl-5α-androstan-1-en-3-one (2) Colorless crystalline solid; m.p. 173–174°C; [α]25D -45.4 (c 0.03, MeOH); UV (MeOH): λmax nm (log ε) 236.4 (3.9); IR (KBr): νmax: 3358, 1666, 1629, 1095 cm-1; 1H-NMR: (500 MHz, C5D5N) see Table 2; 13C-NMR: (125 MHz, C5D5N) see Table 2; EI-MS (%): m/z 332 (M+, 30), 274 (25), 216 (20), 176 (39), 174 (52), 161 (34), 147 (24), 123 (32), 108 (31), 91 (56), 71 (100), 55 (95); HREI-MS: m/z 332.2333 (M+ [C21H32O3]+, calcd 332.2351).

Cells were proliferated as reported earlier [22]. Briefly, cells were cultured at a concentration of 2 × 106/mL in a 96-well round bottom tissue culture plate. Cells were stimulated with 5 μg/mL of phytohemagglutinin. Various concentrations of compounds were added to obtain final concentrations of 0.5, 5, 50 μg/mL, each in triplicate. The plate was incubated for 72 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 environment. After 72 h, cells were pulsed with 0.5 μCi/well, tritiated thymidine, and further incubated for 18 h. Cells were harvested onto a glass fiber filter by using cell harvester. The tritiated thymidine incorporation into the cells, which reflects the proliferation level, was measured by a liquid scintillation counter.Phagocyte chemiluminescence assay Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence assay was performed according to the previous reported method [23]. Briefly 25 μL of whole blood or neutrophils (1 × 106/mL), suspended in Hank’s solution, were incubated with 25 μL compounds (1, 10, 100 μg/mL for whole blood and 0.5, 5, 50 μg/mL for neutrophils) for 30 min. Zymosan 25 μL (20 mg/mL), followed by 25 μL (7 × 10-5 M) of luminol was added to make a final volume of 100 μL. A control without the compound was also run. Peak chemiluminescence was recorded using the luminometer. The luminometer was set with repeated scan mode, 50 scans with 30 s intervals and one second point measuring time.Cytotoxicity assay The cytotoxicity of compounds was determined by using the MTT cellular assay [24,25] against a normal mouse fibroblast (3T3) cell line. Cells were grown in DMEM and MEM (modified Eagle’s medium), containing 10% FBS and 2% antibiotic (penicillin and streptomycin), and maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 hours in a flask. Cells were plated (1 × 105 cell/mL) in 96-well flat bottom plates and incubated for 24 hours for cell attachment. Various concentrations of compounds, ranging between 1.25-100 μM, were added into the well and incubated for 48 hours. A 50 μL [2 mg/mL] MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was added to the well, 4 hours before the end of incubation. Medium and reagents were aspirated and 100 μL DMSO was added and mixed thoroughly for 15 minutes to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm by using a microplate reader. Finally, IC50 (μM) values were calculated, and the experiment was repeated at least three times. Cycloheximide was used as the standard for normal fibroblast cell line.Competing interests The authors have no competing interests.Authors’ contributions MIC, AR, MAM and AMA-M participated in experimental strategy design, supervision and manuscript writing.

However, the mechanisms that regulate T cell activation in psoriasis are still incompletely understood. The objective of the present study was to characterize the main genetic pathways associated with T cell activation in psoriasis. Gene expression profiles from activated T cells were obtained from 17 psoriasis patients and 7 healthy controls using Illumina HT-12 v4 microarrays. From a total of 47,321 analyzed transcripts, 42 genes were found to be differentially expressed between psoriasis and controls (FDR p-value < 0.1, absolute fold-change > 1.2). Using an independent cohort of 8 patients and 8 healthy controls we validated the overexpression of (p-value =0.0009) and (p-value =0.0012) genes in activated T cells from psoriasis patients. Using weighted correlation analysis we identified and coexpression networks, which were also significantly associated with psoriasis (p-value < 0.05). Gene Ontology analysis allowed the identification of several biological processes associated with each coexpression network. Finally, using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis over the global T cell transcriptome we also found additional genetic pathways strongly associated with psoriasis (p-value < 0.0001). This study has identified two new genes, and , strongly associated with T cell activation in psoriasis.

Background Psoriasis is a chronic T-cell-mediated inflammatory disease that affects approximately 2% of the world population [1]. Histologically, it is characterized by the infiltration of active immune cells into the skin, the hyperplasia of blood vessels and the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. The leukocyte infiltrate in psoriasis lesions is composed mainly by T cells, predominantly CD4 + -type cells but also CD8 + -type T cells [2]. T cells are known to expand and migrate into the epidermis before the onset of the first epidermal changes, and steadily continue to do so, promoting and perpetuating the disease [3]. The central role of T cells in psoriasis pathogenesis was first evidenced in the late 70s, when the T cell suppressor cyclosporine A was discovered as an effective treatment for psoriasis inflammation [4]. In the 90′s elegant studies using skin xenografts of with non-lesional skin from patients with psoriasis showed the conversion to psoriatic plaques when mice were injected with preactivated T cells from the same patient [5]. Since then, a substantial amount evidence supporting the key role for T cells, mainly type 1 T helper subtype (Th1), has been accumulated [6–11]. More recently, IL17 and IL22 producing T lymphocytes (Th17 and Th22, respective) have been characterized as critical mediators of psoriasis pathogenesis [12–14]. However, the triggering events and deregulated pathways that lead to the aberrant T cell activation in psoriasis patients are still poorly defined. In the present study we aimed to increase the knowledge on this particular aspect of psoriasis etiology by characterizing the T cell gene expression profile associated with psoriasis during T cell activation. To date, psoriasis has been investigated by a number of whole genome gene expression studies. These have been mainly conducted with skin biopsy samples, through the comparison of lesional and non-lesional skin. Gene expression analysis in biopsies from skin lesions is of great interest in psoriasis and has produced several important findings [15–21]. However, one limitation of this approach is that the mixture of the different cell types that coexist in the skin tissue is likely to mask relevant gene expression patterns. Specially, if the cell type of interest is not the predominant component of the total tissue extract, as in the case of infiltrating T cells in lesional skin, the resulting gene expression data could not be informative. An alternative to skin biopsy analysis has been the analysis of gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients and controls [22–25]. This approach is of particularly interest in immune-mediated diseases like psoriasis, since it is a less invasive approach and, consequently, predictive profiles can have a better translation into the clinical setting. However, most T cells circulating in the peripheral blood are in a quiescent state [26], with scarce gene expression activity [27]. Consequently, relevant pathogenic processes like T cell activation might not well be studied through this approach. In the present study we have used in vitro activated T cells from patients and healthy controls to characterize the gene expression profile associated with psoriasis. Using an independent cohort of patients and controls we have validated the most significant genes associated with this differential regulatory activity. Finally, using different genomic approaches we have characterized the gene expression networks and biological pathways that characterize this key aspect of psoriasis biology.Results Gene expression profiles from in vitro activated T cells were obtained from 17 psoriasis patients and 7 healthy controls using Illumina HT-12 v4 microarrays. From each individual gender, age was collected, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score was determined for each patient at the time of sample collection (Additional file 1). There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) in age or gender between the microarray and validation case control samples. Also, the PASI score was not significantly different between discovery and validation patient samples. From each RNA sample, a total of 47,321 transcripts were quantified and 23,554 probes were called as expressed in the sample (i.e. present in 2 or more individuals) according to the Illumina expression score and selected for statistical analysis.Differentially expressed genes in in vitro activated T cells A total of 42 genes were found to be significantly associated with psoriasis (FDR p-value < 0.1, absolute fold change > 1.2, Additional file 2). From these, 25 were found to be up-regulated in T cells from psoriasis patients and 17 genes were down-regulated in patients compared to controls. The genes with FDR p-value < 0.05 showing the largest change in gene expression (i.e. absolute fold change > 1.2) are shown in Table  1.Table 1 List of most significantly up-regulated genes in in vitro activated T cells of psoriasis patients compared to healthy controls ProbeGeneFold changeP value*Full name Upregulated genes ILMN_1683678 SPATS2L 1.370.0009Spermatogenesis associated, serine-rich 2-likeILMN_1735014 KLF6 1.320.0012Kruppel-like factor 6ILMN_1703263 SP140 1.380.0025SP140 nuclear body proteinILMN_2322498 RORA 1.310.0041RAR-related orphan receptor AILMN_2246956 BCL2 1.230.0062B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2ILMN_2397721 GLB1 1.230.0062Galactosidase, beta 1ILMN_1781285 DUSP1 1.210.0071Dual specificity phosphatase 1ILMN_2321064 BAX 1.240.0096BCL2-associated X proteinILMN_1731107 CCDC92 1.330.0136Coiled-coil domain containing 92ILMN_1729749 HERC5 1.720.0267Hect domain and RLD 5ILMN_2095660 TMEM156 1.290.0453Transmembrane protein 156ILMN_1681301 AIM2 1.420.0464Absent in melanoma 2ILMN_1767470 SCPEP1 1.260.0469Serine carboxypeptidase 1 Downregulated genes ILMN_1778617 TAF9 −1.250.0009TAF9 RNA polymerase II, TATA box binding protein (TBP)-associated factor, 32kDaILMN_2143250 FAR1 −1.200.0207Fatty acyl CoA reductase 1ILMN_1720114 GMNN −1.200.0269GemininILMN_2135175 SNORD36A −1.270.0303Small nucleolar RNA, C/D box 36A *Multiple-test corrected p-value.

Genes that were selected to validate are highlighted in bold.Validation of genes associated with psoriasis in T cells From the list of significant differentially expressed genes, we selected those genes showing a high level of statistical association (Pcorrected < 0.005) with the largest absolute change in expression (i.e. Fold Change (FC) > 1.3) for validation. These genes were spermatogenesis associated serine-rich 2-like (SPATS2L, FC = 1.37, Pcorrected = 0.0009), Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6, FC = 1.32, p-value = 0.0012), SP140 nuclear body protein (SP140, FC = 1.38, p-value = 0.0025) and RAR-related orphan receptor A (RORA, FC = 1.31, p-value = 0.0041) (Figure  1a) genes. Using the same set of samples from the microarray analysis we first performed a RT-PCR technical validation study. We were able to validate the differential expression observed for SPATS2L (FC = 1.39, p-value = 0.0006), KLF6 (FC = 1.24, p-value = 0.022) and SP140 (FC = 1.34, p-value = 0.019) genes (Figure  1b). RORA differential expression was not validated (p-value > 0.05) and, consequently, we did not perform biological validation on this sample.Figure 1 Validation of the most significantly up-regulated genes in in vitro activated T cells of psoriasis patients compared to healthy controls.

After technical validation, we used an independent sample of patients and controls recruited from the same University Hospitals to validate the association of SPATS2L, KLF6 and SP140 genes with the activation of T cells in psoriasis. Using in vitro activated T cells from 8 patients and 8 controls we significantly validated the overexpression of SPATS2L (FC = 1.58, p-value = 0.0014) and KLF6 (FC = 1.23, p-value = 0.024) genes in psoriasis (Figure  1b). SP140 did not show significant differential expression in the independent replication cohort.Identification of SPAT2SL and KLF6 coexpression networks Since SPAT2SL and KLF6 have not been previously associated to the T lymphocyte activation process, we aimed to identify and analyze the gene expression network associated to each of the two genes. For this objective we used the weighted correlation analysis implemented in the WGCNA method [28]. After filtering for the most informative genes (i.e. coefficient of variation > 0.1, n = 4,512 genes), we identified a total of 20 different gene expression modules (Additional file 3). Using the eigenvectors derived from each gene expression module we evaluated the association to different clinical and epidemiological variables (Additional file 4). From these, we found four modules significantly associated with the presence of psoriasis (p-value < 0.05, Additional files 5 and 6). These four modules were not associated with any of the other tested covariates. The first of these modules (M1, p-value = 0.00051) included 54 genes and was the most enriched in genes differentially expressed between psoriasis cases and controls (59.3% at nominal p-value < 0.05). The second module (M2, p-value = 0.0038) consisted in 92 genes from which 37% were differentially expressed. The third module (M3, p-value = 0.011) included 31 genes and 29% from them showed differential expression. Finally, the fourth module (M4, p-value = 0.047) included a total of 115 genes, but with a lower percentage showing differential expression between cases and controls (24.3%). SPATS2L was found to belong to M1 gene expression module, while KLF6 was found to be coexpressed with genes in module M2. The fourth module associated with psoriasis, M4, included the genome-wide significant RORA gene that could not be technically validated by RTPCR.Gene Ontology analyses of SPATS2L and KLF6 coexpression networks In order to functionally characterize SPATS2L and KLF6 coexpression networks we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using DAVID functional annotation tool [29]. Table  2 shows the most significantly enriched GO terms related to biological processes. The complete list, with the significant GO terms associated to cellular component and molecular function, is provided in the Additional file 7.Table 2 Summary of the enriched GO Biological Process terms in SPATS2L and KLF6 coexpression networks Biological process in SPATS2L networkTermCount%p-valueGO:0051276 ~ chromosome organization512.81.90E-02GO:0042273 ~ ribosomal large subunit biogenesis25.12.12E-02GO:0006461 ~ protein complex assembly512.82.17E-02GO:0070271 ~ protein complex biogenesis512.82.17E-02GO:0042254 ~ ribosome biogenesis37.72.79E-02GO:0034622 ~ cellular macromolecular complex assembly410.32.99E-02GO:0034621 ~ cellular macromolecular complex subunit organization410.34.01E-02GO:0006325 ~ chromatin organization410.34.63E-02 Biological process in KLF6 network Term Count % p-value GO:0006695 ~ cholesterol biosynthetic process56.333.95E-06GO:0016126 ~ sterol biosynthetic process56.331.35E-05GO:0044271 ~ nitrogen compound biosynthetic process810.134.08E-04GO:0006694 ~ steroid biosynthetic process56.334.45E-04GO:0008203 ~ cholesterol metabolic process56.336.01E-04GO:0016125 ~ sterol metabolic process56.338.54E-04GO:0009070 ~ serine family amino acid biosynthetic process33.809.36E-04GO:0008652 ~ cellular amino acid biosynthetic process45.061.28E-03GO:0008610 ~ lipid biosynthetic process78.862.30E-03GO:0008299 ~ isoprenoid biosynthetic process33.803.16E-03GO:0009309 ~ amine biosynthetic process45.064.80E-03GO:0006094 ~ gluconeogenesis33.804.92E-03GO:0009069 ~ serine family amino acid metabolic process33.805.31E-03GO:0019319 ~ hexose biosynthetic process33.807.50E-03GO:0070814 ~ hydrogen sulfide biosynthetic process22.538.41E-03GO:0070813 ~ hydrogen sulfide metabolic process22.538.41E-03GO:0019344 ~ cysteine biosynthetic process22.538.41E-03GO:0034976 ~ response to endoplasmic reticulum stress33.808.97E-03 List of enriched GO terms related to biological process (BP) in the SPATS2L (p-value < 0.05) and KLF6 coexpression networks (p-value < 0.01). For each term, the number of genes present in the network (count), the percentage of enrichment (%) and the associated p-value are indicated. In the SPATS2L coexpression network, eight GO terms were found to be significantly enriched (p-values from 0.01 to 0.05). Most of these GO terms were related to different aspects of chromosome and ribosomal biology (e.g., GO:0051276, chromosome organization, p-value = 0.019; GO:0042273, ribosomal biogenesis, p-value = 0.021). In the KLF6 coexpression network 35 GO terms were found to be significantly enriched (p-values ranging from 3.95×10e-6 to 0.05). In this network, the most significantly enriched GO terms (p-value < 0.01) were involved in lipid synthesis (n = 7 ontologies), followed by GO terms associated with amino acid biosynthesis (n = 6 ontologies), hydrogen sulphide process (n = 2 ontologies) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (n = 1 ontology).Gene set enrichment analysis of the T cell transcriptome In order to further investigate the biological basis of the gene expression differences observed between T cells from psoriasis patients and controls, we analyzed the global transcriptome using the GSEA approach [30, 31]. A total of 55 gene sets were found to be significantly enriched between cases and controls (False Discovery Rate, FDR < 0.05) (Table  3). From these, four gene sets were significant at a FDR < 0.0001 all belonging to Reactome database [32] pathway definitions: Cytokine Signaling in Immune System, Interferon Signaling, Interferon Gamma Signaling and Interferon Alpha/Beta Signaling.Table 3 Summary of the GSEA-identified gene sets in in vitro activated T cells of psoriasis patients compared to healthy controls NameNESNOM p-valFDR q-val General processes of immune system Reactome cytokine signaling in immune system2.4980.0000.0000KEGG cytokine cytokine receptor interaction1.9800.0000.0130KEGG hematopoietic cell lineage1.9170.0000.0167KEGG cell adhesion molecules cams1.9030.0000.0173 Infectious and autoimmune diseases KEGG autoimmune thyroid disease1.9960.0020.0126KEGG allograft rejection1.8660.0000.0234KEGG leishmania infection1.9610.0000.0121KEGG viral myocarditis1.9000.0000.0175 T cell activation Reactome downstream TCR signaling1.8690.0000.0232PID NFAT TF pathway1.9030.0000.0179PID AP1 pathway1.9360.0000.0148Biocarta CTLA4 pathway1.8540.0000.0253 Innate immune system activation Reactome innate immune system2.1450.0000.0014Reactome inflammasomes1.9050.0000.0180Reactome antiviral mechanism by IFN stimulated genes1.9150.0000.0160Reactome RIG I MDA5 mediated induction of IFN alpha beta pathways2.2120.0000.0005KEGG RIG I like receptor signaling pathway2.1440.0000.0012Reactome negative regulators of RIG I MDA5 signaling2.1230.0000.0018KEGG NOD like receptor signaling pathway1.9530.0000.0128Reactome nucleotide binding domain leucine rich repeat containing receptor NLR signaling pathways2.0480.0000.0058KEGG toll like receptor signaling pathway1.8020.0000.0398Reactome TRAF6 mediated IRF7 activation1.8750.0020.0226KEGG cytosolic DNA sensing pathway1.7810.0020.0449 Cytokine signaling KEGG JAK STAT signaling pathway1.9770.0000.0119PID IL12 STAT4 pathway1.7750.0040.0454Reactome interferon signaling2.7010.0000.0000Reactome interferon alpha beta signaling2.7600.0000.0000Reactome interferon gamma signaling2.3030.0000.0000PID IFNG pathway1.7870.0020.0434PID SMAD2 3 nuclear pathway2.0940.0000.0031Reactome transcriptional activity OF SMAD2 SMAD3 SMAD4 heterotrimer1.7940.0020.0421Reactome SMAD2 SMAD3 SMAD4 heterotrimer regulates transcription1.7710.0120.0451 Differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis PID notch pathway1.9160.0000.0163PID Betacatenin Nuc pathway1.8440.0020.0271Biocarta gleevec pathway1.8620.0000.0237PID CMYB pathway1.8420.0000.0271Reactome YAP1 AND WWTR1 TAZ stimulated gene expression1.8040.0080.0400PID P53 downstream pathway1.7720.0000.0452 Metabolism Reactome cholesterol biosynthesis2.0500.0000.0063Reactome fatty acid triacylglycerol and ketone body metabolism1.9610.0000.0128Reactome metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins1.9270.0000.0157KEGG biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids1.7900.0060.0429KEGG glycine serine and threonine metabolism1.8770.0000.0227KEGG metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P4501.9240.0020.0157Reactome PPARA activates gene expression2.0760.0000.0043Biocarta PPARA pathway1.7800.0060.0444 Unfolded protein response Reactome unfolded protein response1.9720.0000.0120Reactome perk regulated gene expression1.8720.0000.0230Reactome activation of genes by ATF41.8960.0000.0180PID ATF2 pathway1.9770.0000.0125 Other KEGG intestinal immune network for IGA production1.9960.0000.0117KEGG lysosome1.9510.0000.0127Reactome generic transcription pathway1.8130.0000.0372PID HIF1 TFPATHWAY1.7780.0020.0444Reactome RORA activates circadian expression1.7730.0070.0457 List of the enriched gene sets in psoriasis phenotype compared to control phenotype showing a FDR < 0.05. Gene sets are classified according to the processes where they are involved. Normalized enrichment score (NES), nominal p-value (NOM p-value) and false discovery rate (FDR q-value) are indicated. The top gene sets identified using GSEA encoded for cytokine signalling-related genes, more specifically, for genes associated with alpha/beta and gamma interferon signalling. Consistent with this strong interferon response, a group of gene sets related to innate immune system (FDR = 0.0014) and RIG and NOD-like receptor pathways (FDR = 0.0005 and 0.0058, respectively) were also among the most significantly enriched. T cell activation in psoriasis patients also resulted in a significant enrichment of genes involved in PPARα-mediated activation of gene expression (FDR = 0.0043) and cholesterol biosynthesis (FDR = 0.0063). Cholesterol biosynthesis was also the most significant GO biological process associated with KLF6 coexpression network. Finally, protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulm was also a common pathway detected by GSEA (i.e. unfolded protein response, FDR = 0.012) and in the GO analysis of KLF6 network.Discussion It is widely accepted that psoriasis is a T-cell mediated disease, in which lymphocytes continuously infiltrate the skin promoting and perpetuating inflammation. However, little is known yet on the gene expression regulation that characterizes T cell activation in psoriasis. Most of the whole genome gene expression studies in psoriasis performed to date have been principally been conducted in skin, where the T cell-associated gene expression is obscured by other more predominant cell types like hyperproliferative keratinocytes. Alternatively, in gene expression studies using freshly isolated blood lymphocytes, most T cells are found in a quiescent state and might not reflect gene expression profiles relevant to the disease. In the present study, we aimed to overcome these limitations by characterizing the differential gene expression profile of in vitro activated T cells in psoriasis patients and controls. To our knowledge, it is the first study to analyze T cell activation in psoriasis using whole-genome gene expression analysis. In the microarray analysis of in vitro activated T cells we were able to identify 42 genes differentially expressed between psoriasis patients and controls. Using an independent sample of patients and controls we validated the association of the two genes most highly overexpressed in psoriasis T cells, SPATS2L and KLF6. It is the first time that SPATS2L and KLF6 genes have been associated with the T cell activation process in psoriasis. To date, little is known on the biological functionality of SPATS2L. In our study, combining gene coexpression network analysis and Gene Ontology enrichment we found that SPATS2L gene network is associated to processes associated with the activation of gene expression including chromosomal organization and ribosomal biogenesis. This potential association of SPATS2L with ribosomal processes and translational control has been previously described in gene-trap experiments conducted in myoblasts under oxidative stress [33]. Ribosomal biogenesis has been proved to be critical in the control of cell growth and cell proliferation [34], and in T cells, is one of the most significantly up-regulated cellular processes during cell-cycle entry [35]. Therefore, the overexpression of SPATS2L in activated T cells from psoriasis patients could be contributing to an earlier activation of these lymphocytes compared to healthy controls. Consistently with this potential role in altered cell activation, there is evidence that SPATS2L is associated with lymphoproliferative-type of disorders. Analyzing the overexpression of SPATS2L in different human diseases, we found that SPATS2L is one of the genes most significantly overexpressed in lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) compared to cells from normal controls (Additional file 8) [36]. Also, SPATS2L is found to be significantly overexpressed in a mouse model of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Additional file 8) [37]. Furthermore, gene expression data from leukemia cell lines treated with anti-leukemic agent Imatinib, shows a significant downregulation of SPATS2L (Additional file 8). Finally, a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) data on risk loci for lymphoblastic leukemia has shown a significant association of a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in the SPATS2L locus [38]. Together, these results show that SPATS2L functionality is strongly associated with the aberrant activation of lymphocytes. Interestingly, there is evidence that psoriasis and lymphoproliferative disorders could share common genetic basis. Patients with psoriasis have an increased risk of developing leukemia, in particular lymphoma [39]. In a GWAS performed in follicular lymphoma, the region with most significant association was located near the psoriasis susceptibility region 1 (PSORS1) in chromosome 6 [40]. Furthermore, a fairly common manifestation of certain leukemias, including lymphocytic leukemias, is the infiltration of neoplastic leukocytes in skin tissue, also known as leukemia cutis [41]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that SPATS2L is involved in a common genetic pathway associated with psoriasis and lymphoproliferative-type of disorders. This pathway would therefore participate in the aberrant lymphocyte activity observed in both diseases and the preferential infiltration of skin tissue by these altered lymphocytes. KLF6 encodes a member of Kruppel family of transcription factors [42], several of which have been previously implicated in T lymphocyte biology [43]. KLF6 has been previously shown to be expressed in lymphoid cells [44, 45] and, similarly to SPATS2L, there is also evidence of differential expression of KLF6 in T cells from CLL patients compared to controls [46]. Compared to SPATS2L however, KLF6 coexpression network showed a highly significant Gene Ontology enrichment, mainly in ontologies related to the biosynthesis of lipids and proteins. These biosynthetic processes are induced in cells that are stimulated to rapidly grow and proliferate, as it is the case of activated T cells [47–50]. Two other significant biological processes enriched in the KLF6 network were endoplasmic reticulum stress and biosynthesis of hydrogen sulfide. These processes are linked to another process also found to be enriched by psoriasis in GSEA analysis which is the unfolded protein response (UPR) [51, 52]. Interestingly, the expression of KLF6 and other KLF members has been previously reported to be up-regulated when UPR is induced by different drugs, such as tunicamycin [53] or thapsigargin (Additional file 8) [54]. On the basis of this information, it is possible that in T cells from psoriasis patients, KLF6 up-regulation may also be induced by an UPR, in this case, triggered by the increase in protein-folding load required upon T cell activation. We have investigated the biological processes that take place during T cell activation associated with psoriasis using both an unsupervised approach which does not use sample information, WGCNA, as well as a supervised approach, GSEA, which compares gene sets overrepresented in cases compared to controls. Even though these are clearly different functional analysis, they resulted in the identification of common biological processes. One of these common biological processes was the biosynthesis of lipids and proteins. For example, cholesterol biosynthesis was the most significantly enriched process in KLF6 coexpression network and was also detected by GSEA as one of the most enriched processes in T cells from psoriasis patients. This enrichment in genes involved in biosynthetic processes could be attributed to an early activation of T cells from psoriasis patients. Another common biological pathway identified in both approaches was the endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response. Interestingly, these two processes, which may result from the increased protein-folding load required in activated T cells, have been associated with a number of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases like spondyloarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases or multiple sclerosis [55–57]. The most significantly enriched gene sets identified by GSEA were, however, related to cytokine signalling (FDR < 0.0001), more specifically, to genes involved in the interferon signalling pathway (IFN pathway FDR < 0.0001; IFNG signalling, FDR < 0.0001; IFNA/B signalling, FDR < 0.0001). This result is fully consistent with the strong interferon-signature detected in psoriasis skin lesions [20]. In line with this observation, GSEA results also show evidence of an association with IL12-STAT4 pathway, an interferon gamma inducing pathway, although at much lower significance. IFN has been shown to drive activation and differentiation of IL17 and IL22 producing T cells [58], and to increase keratinocyte responsiveness to IL22 which leads to the observed hyperproliferation [59]. In line with these observations, GSEA analysis also identified an enrichment of innate immune sensing mechanisms related to the production of IFN like RIG-I receptor signaling pathway (FDR = 0.0005) [60] and the NLR family of receptors like NOD2 [61] (FDR = 0.0058). Together, these results suggest that IFN response pathway is more strongly activated in T cells from psoriasis patients than normal healthy controls. The four T cell gene networks associated with psoriasis risk identified through WGCNA analysis were found to be highly enriched for genes associated to the response to virus biological process (Additional file 9). A total of 14 genes (BCL2, ISG15, EIF2AK2, IFIH1, IRF7, ISG20, IFI35, IFI44, MX1, MX2, RSAD2, STAT1, STAT2 and TRIM5) out of 61 overexpressed by T cells (P < 1e-16, test for enrichment) were associated to the response to a viral infection. This result is in accordance with the recent evidence implicating an increased antiviral activity in psoriatic skin compared to skin from normal controls or patients with atopic dermatitits [62]. In this model, keratinocytes are rendered hyperresponsive towards an antiviral response after being conditioned from T helper 17 (Th17) cell-type cytokines. In the last years the two newly characterized T-cell subsets, Th17 and Th22, have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. While our approach does not provide direct evidence of an increase of either cell subset, it describes an increased activation of precursor cells in affected individuals. It is therefore likely that this differential activity predisposes to these two particular cell types once in the skin microenvironment of psoriasis patients. Additional studies will be needed to confirm this hypothesis. Another limitation of our study is that we analyzed the global expression changes of all activated T cells, regardless of the specific subphenotype. While we found no statistically significant differences in CD4+ or CD8+ percentages in cases compared to controls (data not shown), it is possible that specific subphenotypes are differently represented between the two groups. Therefore, future studies will be performed to identify which cell subtype/s are responsible for each of the differentially expressed genes and genetic pathways associated with psoriasis in our study.Conclusions In the present study, we have investigated for the first time the gene expression profile specifically associated with T cell activation in psoriasis. We have identified SPATS2L and KLF6 as the two genes most significantly overexpressed in activated T cells from psoriasis patients and we have validated this overexpression in an independent case-control cohort. Functional analysis of the gene coexpression networks, suggest that SPATS2L and KLF6 might be involved in an early activation process. Global functional enrichment also shows a strong prevalence of interferon cytokine mediated signalling in activated T cells from psoriasis compared to controls. The results of this study associate new biological pathways with psoriasis etiology and establish new lines of research that will clearly lead to an improved knowledge of the biological basis of this disease and, hopefully, to improved therapies in the near future.MethodsSubjects Fifteen healthy controls and twenty-five psoriasis patients were included in the present study. Controls (mean ± SD age 40.8 ± 8.8 years; 9 men and 6 women) didn’t have psoriasis or any other immune mediated inflammatory disease and were collected from medical staff at the Vall d’Hebron Hospital (Barcelona, Spain). Psoriasis patients (mean ± SD age 46 ± 8.4 years; 14 men and 11 women), were recruited from the outpatient’s clinics of the dermatology departments from Santa Creu i Sant Pau Hospital (Barcelona, Spain) and Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital (Badalona, Spain). All selected patients had chronic plaque psoriasis as diagnosed by a dermatologist, affecting torso and/or extremities with at least one year of duration. Patients with a single clinical localization of plaque psoriasis (i.e. scalp, face, palmoplantar), with exclusively inverse plaque psoriasis or with an inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. All patients were >18 years old at the time of recruitment, although disease onset could have occurred at an earlier age. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and protocols were reviewed and approved by the Vall d’Hebron University Hospital ethics committee. The present study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Additional file 1 summarizes the main clinical features of patients and controls (age, gender, PASI score).Cell culture Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood of patients and controls by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient. PBMCs were then seeded in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 μM mercaptoethanol, and activated with 1μg/ml of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). After 72 hours of stimulation, activated T cells were harvested by centrifugation and processed for flow cytometry study or frozen at -20°C for subsequent RNA isolation.Flow cytometry analysis In order to characterize the T lymphocyte population present in cultured PBMCs samples and verify their activation after stimulation by CD3 and CD28 ligation, we performed flow cytometric analysis. In vitro activated cells were stained with anti-human CD4-PE (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and anti-human CD8-PerCP (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) antibodies before acquisition (FC500 Flow Cytometer, Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) and analysis (Flowjo, Tree Star, Inc., Oregon, USA). Forward and side scatters were used to gate resting and blast lymphocytes, and CD4+ or CD8+ -type cells were counted within each gate. The average percentage of blasting cells was 75.94 (+/- 9.9) with 51.36% (+/-11.3) being CD4+ and 37.87% (+/-10.7) corresponding to CD8+. No statistically significant differences were observed between cases and controls.RNA isolation Total RNA was isolated from previously activated T cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA yield was assessed using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). All RNA samples had a RNA Integrity Number higher than 9 and were subsequently used for microarray analysis.Microarray analysis and differential gene expression determination Whole genome gene expression analysis of in vitro activated T cells for 17 psoriasis patients and 7 healthy controls was carried out by the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology using the Illumina HT-12 V4 microarrays (Illumina, USA). Briefly, the Illumina CustomPrep RNA amplification kit (Appiled Biosystems, USA) was used to generate biotinylated amplified complementary RNA (cRNA) from 200 ng of the extracted total RNA. Labelled cRNA was then hybridized overnight to the Illumina microarrays, washed, blocked, stained and scanned using the Illumina BeadStation 500. The GenomeStudio software v2011.1 (Illumina, USA) was used to generate the raw data from the microarray scanned images. HT-12 V4 microarrays allow the simultaneous profiling of >47,000 transcripts, which include 28,688 well-established RefSeq annotations from the Human RefSeq (Rel 38). Sample labeling, microarray hybridization, scanning and raw data acquisition were performed at HudsohAlpha Institute for Biotechnology (Alabama, USA). Data preprocessing, normalization and differential expression was performed using the R-statistical software v12.0 [63]. Log2-transformed data was normalized using the quantile normalization method [64]. Using the probe detection p-value calculated by GenomeStudio, only those transcripts present in 3 or more samples were considered for differential expression analysis. After filtering, a total of 25,539 transcripts were finally used to determine the associated gene expression profiles. Differential gene expression between cases and controls was tested using the t-test method implemented in the Bioconductor multtest package [65]. Correction for multiple testing was performed using the Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate method [66]. From these significant genes, only those having an absolute fold change >1.2 were considered to be differentially expressed between the two conditions.Real-time PCR validation 200 ng of total RNA from 8 psoriasis cases and 8 controls were reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCRs were performed on an ABI PRISM7900 Sequence Detection HT system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and using the TaqMan® chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The thermal cycle conditions were: 50°C for two minutes, 95°C for 10 minutes and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for one minute. The selected TaqMan expression assays were: Hs01016366_m1 (SPATS2), Hs00296661_s1 (KLF6), Hs00916867_m1 (SP140), Hs00931153_m1 (RORA) and Hs01060665_g1 (ACTB). The method of 2 - [Delta] [Delta] Ct was used to obtain the mRNA expression of psoriasis samples relative to the control samples, normalizing the Ct values of target genes with those of the housekeeping gene actin beta (ACTB).Gene expression network analysis Genes involved in a same biological process or genetic pathway tend to show correlated levels of expression. Using this property there are different methods that are able to build up networks of genes that better characterize the biological process of interest [67]. Such analysis can also provide a powerful approach for elucidating the unknown role of a given gene, based on the pathways or processes in which the other genes in the same network are involved. In the present study we have used the Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) approach to infer the gene expression modules in activated T cells that are associated with psoriasis [28]. After calculating the co-expression matrix using Pearson’s correlation method, a network adjacency is calculated by raising the co-expression similarity to a power β. Then using the scale-free topology criterion [68], the threshold parameter that defines the connectivity between genes is chosen. Once the threshold for connectivity is set, the coexpression network can be built. Within this network, clusters of densely connected genes (i.e. modules) are defined using unsupervised clustering and the Dynamic Tree Cut method [69]. Finally, for each gene expression module a summary measure or eigengene can be calculated using the first principal component of the corresponding expression matrix. Each eigengene was subsequently used to test for association with psoriasis and other relevant clinical and epidemiological covariates (age, gender, PASI score, % of activated lymphocytes and % CD4 or CD8 subsets). For binary variables the t-test was used, while for quantitative variables a linear regression approach was used. In order to contextualize the gene networks associated with psoriasis, we performed a comprehensive search for previous studies having found evidence between the network genes and the disease. Using each gene annotation and the term ‘psoriasis’ we performed systematic queries using NCBI Pubmed database (October 2013). In order to reduce the presence of false positives only genes with absolute FCH > 1.2 were included. A total of 70 overexpressed genes and 22 underexpressed genes were queried.Functional annotation of expression modules Gene Ontology (GO) category enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID online tool (i.e. Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/, Bethesda, MD, USA) [29]. Briefly, GO enrichment is calculated comparing the frequency of genes from each different GO present in the set of differently expressed genes to the frequency of genes for this same GO in the human genome background.Gene set enrichment analysis GSEA is a software method to analyze and interpret microarray data using biological knowledge [30, 31]. Using the differential gene expression result between cases and controls and a list of predefined biological sets of genes, GSEA tests the overrepresentation each gene set in the group of most associated genes compared to the group of genes showing lower –or none- evidence of association. In the present study we used GSEA version 2.0.12 (www Broad Institute at MIT), with the C2 curated canonical pathway gene set (i.e. c2.cp.v3.1.symbols.gmt download), collapsing of dataset to gene symbols, weighted enrichment statistic and real gene list sorting. Maximum size of gene sets was set to 500 genes and minimum gene set size was set to 15. Empirical significance values were calculated using 10,000 permutations.Availability of supporting data The datasets supporting the results of this article are available in NCBI’s gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE47598 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47598).Electronic supplementary material Additional file 1: Data on the subjects included in the study.

Translocation of hippocalcin in response to increased cytosolic [Ca2+] was examined in HeLa cells expressing hippocalcin–enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) to determine the dynamics and Ca2+ affinity of the Ca2+/myristoyl switch in living cells. Ca2+-free hippocalcin was freely diffusible, as shown by photobleaching and use of a photoactivable GFP construct. The translocation was dependent on binding of Ca2+ by EF-hands 2 and 3. Using photolysis of NP-EGTA, the maximal kinetics of translocation was determined (1/2 = 0.9 s), and this was consistent with a diffusion driven process. Low intensity photolysis of NP-EGTA produced a slow [Ca2+] ramp and revealed that translocation of hippocalcin–EYFP initiated at around 180 nM and was half maximal at 290 nM. Histamine induced a reversible translocation of hippocalcin–EYFP. The data show that hippocalcin is a sensitive Ca2+ sensor capable of responding to increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration over the narrow dynamic range of 200–800 nM free Ca2+.

The data show that hippocalcin is a sensitive Ca2+ sensor capable of responding to increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration over the narrow dynamic range of 200–800 nM free Ca2+. Introduction Calcium regulates numerous cellular processes and Ca2+ signals can vary from brief localized release events to a prolonged global rise (Bootman et al., 2001). These diverse Ca2+ signals are interpreted by Ca2+ sensor proteins (Carafoli, 2002). Little is known about how Ca2+ sensors react to differing Ca2+ signals, and calmodulin is the only EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein studied in living cells (Craske et al., 1999; Deisseroth et al., 1998; Milikan et al., 2002) and whose in vivo Ca2+ affinity has been determined (Persechini and Cronk, 1999). For other EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins, only in vitro estimates of Ca2+ affinity are available. For an understanding of which Ca2+-binding proteins are functionally activated under particular Ca2+ signaling conditions, it will be essential to have direct information on their dynamics and Ca2+ affinities in living cells. The neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) proteins (Burgoyne and Weiss, 2001) are found mainly in neurons and neuroendocrine cells and are linked with modulation of neurotransmitter release (McFerran et al., 1998; Pongs et al., 1993), regulation of Ca2+ (Tsujimoto et al., 2002; Weiss et al., 2000; Weiss and Burgoyne, 2002) and K+ channels (An et al., 2000; Guo et al., 2002), regulation of phosphoinositide metabolism (Hendricks et al., 1999; Koizumi et al., 2002), phototransduction (Palczewski et al., 2000), and learning (Gomez et al., 2001). Most of the NCS proteins are NH2-terminally myristoylated. Studies on one member of the family, recoverin, showed that the myristoyl group is sequestered in the Ca2+-free form of the protein and following Ca2+-binding a substantial conformational change allows extrusion of the myristoyl group (Ames et al., 1997; Tanaka et al., 1995). This so-called Ca2+/myristoyl switch would allow recoverin to associate with membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The Ca2+/myristoyl switch is used by some other NCS proteins (Ivings et al., 2002; O'Callaghan et al., 2002; Spilker et al., 2000, 2002), whereas others such as NCS-1 and guanylyl cyclase-activating protein (GCAP) 2 are membrane associated even at low [Ca2+] (O'Callaghan et al., 2002; Oleshevskaya et al., 1997). Hippocalcin is an NCS protein most highly expressed in hippocampal neurons (Kobayashi et al., 1992). Its best characterised function is as an inhibitor of neuronal apoptosis through its interaction with neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (Lindholm et al., 2002). Hippocalcin has been shown to have a Ca2+/myristoyl switch mechanism within cells (O'Callaghan et al., 2002), allowing it to be cytosolic at resting [Ca2+] and translocate to intracellular membranes of the TGN and the plasma membrane in response to an increase in [Ca2+]. The Ca2+/myristoyl switch of recoverin has been examined using biochemical and structural approaches, but little work has examined the properties of the switch in NCS proteins in vivo. To address this issue, we have expressed hippocalcin–enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) and observed its behavior in cells in response to controlled increases in intracellular [Ca2+] to characterize the dynamics and the Ca2+ sensitivity of a Ca2+/myristoyl switch protein in living cells. We demonstrate that hippocalcin is highly sensitive to cytosolic [Ca2+], but its translocation properties would require Ca2+ elevations prolonged for seconds to tens of seconds rather than very brief Ca2+ transients for a full response. The properties of hippocalcin would mean that it could integrate both temporal and spatial aspects of Ca2+ signals over a tight dynamic range.Results and discussionTranslocation of hippocalcin in HeLa cells is dependent on Ca2+ binding HeLa cells, which do not have endogenous hippocalcin, were transfected to express hippocalcin–EYFP, allowing the behavior of hippocalcin to be observed in isolation from neuronal-specific interacting proteins. In HeLa cells, NCS-1 is localized in resting cells to the plasma membrane and TGN—the same as the endogenous protein in neurons (Martone et al., 1999; O'Callaghan et al., 2002). Both hippocalcin–EYFP and untagged neurocalcin δ translocate to the same sites following elevation of [Ca2+], irrespective of time of transfection and expression levels (Ivings et al., 2002; O'Callaghan et al., 2002). The validity of using HeLa cells is supported by the finding that the endogenous closely related protein visinin-like protein (VILIP) 1 also translocates to the plasma membrane and TGN in hippocampal neurons (Spilker et al., 2002). Transfected HeLa cells were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator dye Fura red allowing cytosolic [Ca2+] to be measured in parallel. In an unstimulated HeLa cell, hippocalcin–EYFP was diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol and in the nucleus (Fig. 1). A robust and prolonged rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] induced by ionomycin gave a dramatic fall in fluorescence of Fura red and thus an increase in [Ca2+]. After 30 s hippocalcin–EYFP had translocated to a perinuclear compartment (TGN) and to patches on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, upper panel; see also Figures S1 and S2, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200306042/DC1). Nuclear hippocalcin–EYFP was retained in the nucleus. The translocation of hippocalcin–EYFP to membranes is dependent on its myristoylation (O'Callaghan et al., 2002) and was also dependent on the binding of Ca2+ using constructs with the glutamates at positions 85 and 121 mutated to glutamines to prevent Ca2+ binding by EF-hands 2 and 3. Hippocalcin (E85,121Q)-EYFP and hippocalcin(E121Q)-EYFP had a diffuse cytosolic distribution in cells at resting cytosolic [Ca2+] (Fig. 1). When Ca2+ was elevated, translocation of hippocalcin(E121Q)-EYFP occurred but was slower and not detectable until more than 90 s after Ca2+ elevation (Fig. 1, middle panel). In contrast, the distribution of hippocalcin (E85, E121Q)-EYFP was unaffected by the increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] (Fig. 1, lower panel), even after 220 s. These data are consistent with a Ca2+/myristoyl switch requiring Ca2+-binding to EF-hands 2 and 3 of hippocalcin. The slower kinetics with the EF-hand 3 mutant would be consistent with a reduction in Ca2+ affinity and a need for a higher threshold [Ca2+] to be reached. Hippocalcin binds 3 Ca2+ ions in vitro (Kobayashi et al., 1993) due to a nonfunctional EF-hand 1 and we do not rule out a requirement for EF-hand 4. Ca2+-binding to EF-hand 3 may initiate conformational changes in the protein allowing cooperative Ca2+ binding to the other EF-hands as in other NCS proteins (Cox et al., 1994; Permyakov et al., 2000; Senin et al., 2002).Figure 1. Requirement of EF-hands for translocation of hippocalcin–EYFP. HeLa cells were transfected to express hippocalcin–EYFP, hippocalcin (E121Q)-EYFP, or hippocalcin (E85Q, E121Q)-EYFP. After loading with Fura red, live cells were imaged by confocal microscopy and Ca2+ elevated by addition of 3 μM ionomycin. Images are shown immediately before addition (time 0) or at the indicated times after addition of ionomycin. In each case, images of Fura red are shown underneath the corresponding images of EYFP fusion proteins. Bars, 10 μM.Hippocalcin is freely diffusible in the cytoplasm in resting cells To determine that hippocalcin in its Ca2+ unbound form is freely diffusible, localized photobleaching was used to probe the movement of hippocalcin–EYFP in transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2, A and B). A localized area of the cell (Fig. 2 B) was exposed to high-intensity 514-nm light for 30 s. During this period, the whole cytosol rapidly dimmed, indicating that hippocalcin–EYFP was capable of rapid diffusion. Fluorescence was retained in the nucleus, indicating that this is a diffusionally isolated region. The retention of nuclear fluorescence and that of surrounding cells indicates the regional specificity of the photobleaching. To examine the speed at which the diffusion of hippocalcin–EYFP occurs, we created a photoactivatable version termed hippocalcin–photoactivatable (PA)–GFP using photoactivatable GFP (Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002). This protein was only dimly fluorescent (Fig. 2 C) until excited with 430-nm light. The illumination of half of a HeLa cell expressing hippocalcin-PA-GFP allowed the speed of diffusion of the photoactivated hippocalcin-PA-GFP to be measured. In the example shown, fluorescence intensity was monitored at two regions of interest that were 9.37-μm apart. The rate of diffusion of hippocalcin-PA-GFP from the delay between the two regions was 2.9 μm/s. This rate was comparable to that found for PA-GFP (3.2 μm/sec; data not shown). This demonstrates that at resting [Ca2+] cytosolic hippocalcin is not membrane-associated but is freely diffusible in the cytosol. The rate of diffusion would be sufficient to account for the translocation process.Figure 2. Demonstration that hippocalcin–EYFP is freely diffusible in resting cells. (A) HeLa cells were transfected to express hippocalcin–EYFP, which showed a diffuse cytosolic and nuclear localization. (B) One cell was locally photobleached within the indicated box for 30 s leading to a loss of cytosolic fluo-rescence. Nuclear fluorescence in the neighboring cells and in the nucleus of the photobleached cell was unaffected. (C) A cell transfected with pHippo-PA-GFP was illuminated with high-intensity 430-nm light on its right hand side to photoactivate the hippocalcin-PA-GFP. The images i–iv are shown before activation (i) and 2 (ii), 5 (iii), and 15 (iv) s after activation. (C) Time course of GFP fluorescence increases measured in the indicated regions of interest. Bar, 10 μm.Maximal rate of translocation of hippocalcin–EYFP Ionomycin produces a sustained but slow increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] in HeLa cells and so the dynamics of hippocalcin–EYFP translocation will be dependent on the rate of this Ca2+ rise. Indeed translocation of hippocalcin–EYFP after ionomycin addition occurs only after a lag period of around 2 s and then with a time constant of around 12 s. To assess the true maximum rate of Ca2+-dependent translocation and to rule out any effects on the kinetics of Ca2+-buffering by the expressed proteins, pHippo-EYFP transfected HeLa cells were loaded with the caged Ca2+ compound NP-EGTA. Photolysis of the NP-EGTA rapidly increased the cytosolic [Ca2+] to high levels indicated by the sharp drop in Fura red fluorescence and to an immediate initiation of translocation of hippocalcin (Fig. 3, A and B). This translocation could be fitted to first order kinetics with a half time of 0.9 s (mean value from 8 cells) and translocation was complete within <10 s. The initiation of translocation was concomitant with the elevation of [Ca2+], indicating that the conformational change induced by Ca2+ binding is not rate limiting for the translocation.Figure 3. Rapid translocation of hippocalcin–EYFP in response to flash photolysis of NP-EGTA. (A) A HeLa cell expressing hippocalcin–EYFP was imaged for EYFP or Fura red before (i and iii) or after (ii and iv) photolysis of NP-EGTA (B). Fluorescence intensity was monitored in the region of interest and averaged to show the time course of changes in Fura red and hippocalcin–EYFP fluorescence near the TGN. Data shown as mean ± SEM (n = 8 cells).The trigger [Ca2+] for translocation of hippocalcin–EYFP To determine the threshold [Ca2+] for translocation, transfected HeLa cells loaded with Fura red and NP-EGTA were irradiated using low-intensity 360-nm light. This produced a slowly rising ramp in intracellular [Ca2+] seen as a decrease in Fura red fluorescence (Fig. 4 A). By calibrating the Fura red fluorescence, the intracellular [Ca2+] was calculated. The representative experimental trace (Fig. 4 B) shows the progressive rise in [Ca2+] starting at 100 nM. The initiation of translocation was seen when the [Ca2+] reached ∼180 nM and was half-maximal at around 320 nM. The data were replotted as the percentage of translocation versus [Ca2+] and could be fitted by a curve defined by the Hill equation with a K0.5 of 324 nM and a Hill coefficient of 3.3 (Fig. 4 C), showing high cooperativity in the response of hippocalcin to [Ca2+] elevation. The mean for the trigger concentration was 181 ± 9 nM and half maximal translocation was at 293 ± 20 nM free Ca2+ (11 cells). Translocation was complete as [Ca2+] reached ∼800 nM, indicating that hippocalcin has a dynamic range of 200–800 nM free Ca2+. This is more than tenfold as sensitive to Ca2+ than the Kd (5 μM) for recombinant hippocalcin (Kobayashi et al., 1993), demonstrating the problem with reliance on in vitro analyses. The Ca2+ affinity of hippocalcin is higher than that seen for calmodulin, which was around 1 μM free Ca2+ (Persechini and Cronk, 1999).Figure 4. Assessment of the Ca2+ dependency of hippocalcin–EYFP translocation. (A) HeLa cells expressing hippocalcin–EYFP and loaded with Fura red were imaged before (i and iii) and after (ii and iv) release of Ca2+ by slow photolysis of NP-EGTA. (B) Changes in hippocalcin–EYFP fluorescence were monitored in the indicated region near the Golgi complex. Fura red fluorescence over the cell was converted to [Ca2+]. The initiation of translocation (1) and the time it was half-maximal (2) are indicated. (C) The data for percentage translocation were plotted against free Ca2+ concentration near the Golgi complex, and the curve derived by fitting the data to the Hill equation.Hippocalcin responds to agonist-induced Ca2+ elevation and translocation is reversible To examine the reversibility of the Ca2+/myristoyl switch, hippocalcin–EYFP expressing HeLa cells were exposed to NP-EGTA photolysis to induce translocation (Fig. 5 A, i and ii). This translocation was completely reversed after reduction of cytosolic [Ca2+] using 3 μM ionomycin in a Krebs-Ringer buffer bath solution with 3 mM EGTA present (Fig. 5 A, iii). Translocation was then induced again by the replacement of the bath buffer with Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 3 mM Ca2+ (Fig. 5 A, iv). To determine whether hippocalcin would respond to Ca2+ transients induced by physiological agonists we used histamine to stimulate transfected HeLa cells. Fig. 5 B shows the initial response in which rapid translocation occurred upon addition of histamine after a lag of around 2 s. Translocation was half-maximal at 278 nM free Ca2+, similar to that seen with NG-EGTA. Hippocalcin subsequently dissociated from the membranes (Fig. 5 C, iii), but hippocalcin could translocate again to the same sites when ionomycin was added (Fig. 5 C, iv). This indicates the hippocalcin can respond to agonist-induced elevation of [Ca2+] and also that it acts as a fully reversible switch.Figure 5. Hippocalcin–EYFP translocation is reversible and is elicited by agonist stimulation. (A) A HeLa cell expressing hippocalcin–EYFP was imaged before (i) or 10 s after (ii) Ca2+ release by rapid photolysis of NP-EGTA. External Ca2+ was reduced by addition of 3 μM ionomycin/3 mM EGTA (iii) and then elevated again by addition on 3 mM Ca2+ (iv).

Bar, 10 μM.Concluding remarks These experiments have yielded new insights into the behavior of hippocalcin in living cells that indicate how it could integrate both temporal and spatial aspects of Ca2+ signals. The extent of translocation is not just a function of [Ca2+] but also the time that Ca2+ remains elevated. Hippocalcin translocation is more sensitive to increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration than calmodulin but the full responses are on the time scale one seconds to tens of seconds. This is slower than the Ca2+ transients seen in neurons due to action potentials but longer-lasting Ca2+ elevations lasting up to hundreds of milliseconds are physiologically important in neurons for the induction of long-term potentiation or long-term depression (Sabatini et al., 2002; Sjostrom and Nelson, 2002). In a small neuronal process or dendritic spine, hippocalcin could diffuse sufficiently to translocate on such a time scale. One could imagine how the distinct properties of Ca2+ sensors such as calmodulin and hippocalcin could determine distinct cellular responses to differing Ca2+ signals.Materials and methodsPlasmids and transfection of HeLa cells EYFP-tagged hippocalcin (pHippo-EYFP) was made as described previously (O'Callaghan et al., 2002). pHippo(E121Q)-EYFP and pHippo (E85,121Q)-EYFP were made using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The photoactivatable hippocalcin construct pHippo-PA-GFP was made by cutting out the EYFP from pHippo-EYFP and replacing it with the PA-GFP from pPA-GFP-N1. pPA-GFP-N1 was generated with the mutations described previously (Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002). HeLa cells were grown and transfected as described previously (O'Callaghan et al., 2002) and maintained for 8–96 h before use.Confocal laser scanning microscopy on living cells For confocal laser scanning microscopy, live transfected HeLa cells were examined with either a Zeiss LSM 150 confocal microscope or a Leica TCS-SP-MP microscope using a 63× water immersion objective with a 1.2 numerical aperture. Cells were loaded with Fura red (Molecular Probes) by incubation in 5 μM acetoxymethylester and loaded with NP-EGTA (Molecular Probes) by incubation in 10 μM acetoxymethylester in growth medium for 30 min. The cells were bathed in a Krebs-Ringers solution (145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES; pH 7.4) with 3 mM CaCl2 and were excited at 488 nm and light collected at 625–725 nm for Fura red emission and at 525–590 for hippocalcin–EYFP emission. Ionomycin when used was added to the bath solution to a final concentration of 3 μM. With pHippo-PA-GFP, 488-nm illumination was used for excitation, and the emission was collected between 500–550 nm. Photoactivation of Hippo-PA-GFP was with 430-nm laser line illumination at full power of the laser on the Leica TCS-SP-MP system for 15 s. The photolysis of NP-EGTA was by illumination with 360-nm laser light at full power for rapid photolysis and at 6% power for generation of a [Ca2+] ramp. Histamine was added to the bath solution at a final concentration of 100 μM. For calibration of Fura red fluorescence as [Ca2+], the cells were treated with 3 μM ionomycin at the end of the experiment in the presence of 3 mM EGTA to determine Fmin. Due to problems with photobleaching leading to inaccurate direct determination of Fmax, a predicted Fmax value at resting [Ca2+] (FmaxP) was determined based on the use of a resting [Ca2+] of 100 nM that has been well established for HeLa cells (Thomas et al., 2000). [Ca2+] was calculated using a Kd of 140 nM. This calibration method would, if anything, overestimate rather than underestimate the [Ca2+] at which hippocalcin–EYFP translocation was observed. Data for percentage translocation versus [Ca2+] were fitted by nonlinear curve fitting using the Hill equation.Online supplemental material Figure S1 shows different confocal sections through the same HeLa cell after treatment with ionomycin. These were selected to show optimal images of the localization of hippocalcin–EYFP either at the TGN or at the plasma membrane. Figure S2 shows data averaged from four cells from imaging of hippocalcin–EYFP and Fura red fluorescence showing that translocation to the TGN or to the plasma membrane occurs with the same kinetics.

But how ROS works is not well understood. In previous study, we found PUMA (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis) played an important role in oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis. In the present study, we detect the role of PUMA in H2O2-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells and investigate the potential mechanism. We showed that H2O2 stimulated the activity of a 493 PUMA promoter reporter gene construct. Suppressing the expression of PUMA abrogated H2O2-induced apoptosis. Deletion of the Sp1-binding sites also decreased the transactivation of PUMA promoter by H2O2. Furthermore, induction of PUMA promoter activity by H2O2 was abrogated by PFT-α (a p53 inhibitor) and Mithramycin A (a Sp1 inhibitor), as compared with PFT-α alone. To determine the effects of Sp1 on PUMA in H2O2-induced apoptosis, procaspase 3, procaspase 9 and procaspase 8 expression was assessed. Mithramycin A and PFT-α also reduced H2O2-induced apoptosis synergistically and abrogated the expression of procaspase 3 and procaspase 9. Our findings suggest that PUMA plays a role in H2O2-induced apoptosis, and that Sp1 works together with p53 in the regulation of H2O2-induced PUMA expression and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells.

This study provides important regulatory insights in the mechanisms of ROS in colorectal cancer. Introduction Recently, a large body of evidence indicates that ROS plays a central role in intracellular and intercellular signal transduction pathway in a variety of cellular process. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased in colorectal cancer due to increased aerobic metabolism and exposure to various anti-cancer modalities such as ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs [1]. Many factors are involved in this process. ROS are capable of activating certain transcription factors directly and thereby modulating the regulation of gene transcription. Several transcriptional factors such as AP1, Sp1 [2,3], Smad [4] and snail are potentially associated with ROS-triggered cellular process. Apoptosis and cancer are opposed phenomena but ROS have been widely reported to play a key role in both[5,6], suggesting that the regulation of gene expression by oxidants, antioxidants and the redox state remains as a promising therapeutic approach. Hyperphysiological levels of ROS cause DNA damage, mutation and activation of several proto-oncogenes in normal cells [7,8]. On the other hand, the DNA damage and initiation of signal transduction pathways caused by ROS contribute to the cytotoxicity to cancer cells [9]. The mechanism involved is still controversial and its ability to induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer is not yet fully understood. It is generally recognized that oxidative stress is associated with p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis [10,11], but a clear understanding of the downstream regulation mechanisms is still elusive. It has been proposed that Bcl-2 regulates antioxidant pathways at sites of free radical generation [12]. Another gene, called p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), was identified through global profiling as a p53-inducible gene. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified PUMA as a Bcl-2 interacting protein [13]. PUMA is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family and plays an important role in stress-induced apoptosis. Yu et al [13] suggested that PUMA could be directly activated by p53 through p53-responsive elements in its promoter region. The protein encoded by PUMA was exclusively localized to mitochondria where it interacted with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl through its BH3 domain [14]. We have previously shown that oxaliplatin-induced ERK inactivation was involved in the regulation of oxaliplatin-induced PUMA expression and apoptosis [15]. We hypothesized that ROS had a direct effect on PUMA. In the present study, we found that PUMA plays a role in H2O2-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. The effects of H2O2 on the expression of PUMA and the mechanism by which this is regulated were examined. Our results suggest that Sp1 plays a role in H2O2-induced PUMA expression and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. Comprehensive understanding of the ROS-triggered signal transduction, transcriptional activation and regulation of gene expression will help to identify the critical role of ROS in tumor progression and in defining a strategy for chemo-therapeutic intervention.Materials and methodsMaterials All reagents for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen/Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

All other chemicals were of analytical grade.Plasmids The -336/+157 and -36/+157 PUMA-Luc reporter plasmids were a kind gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, U.S.A.). The (-336/+157 -126/-25) PUMA-Luc plasmid was constructed by digesting the -336/+157 PUMA-Luc plasmid with Sac II and SmalI, and re-ligation according to reference 16. pSVβ-Galactosidase plasmid was purchased from promega.Cell culture, transient transfections and luciferase assays The human colorectal cancer cell lines LoVo and HCT116 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassaas, VA), LoVo PUMA_AS cells was established as described in a previous study[15]. The LoVo cells and LoVo PUMA_AS cells were cultured in 25 cm2 flasks in 1640 medium contained 10% (v/v) FBS with or without G418 (600 μg/ml). Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere until confluency and subcultured (1:10 split ratio) using trypsin (0.05% w/v)/EDTA (0.02% w/v). Cells for examination were grown in six-well cluster dishes. All treatments were carried out on cells at 70–80% confluence, PFT-α (20 μM) and Mithr.A (200 ng/ml) were added an hour before addition of H2O2. Transient transfection was performed in 6-well plates using Lipofectamin 2000(Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's instructions. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.1 μg pSVβ, transfections were allowed to proceed for 3 hours in the absence of serum and the cells recovered in medium supplemented with reduced serum level(2.5%) for 21 hours. Luciferase assays were performed 48 hours later using the luciferase assay kit from Promega, according to the manufacture's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The β-galactosidase reporter pSVβ (Promega) was included to control for transfection efficiency.Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 0.5 μg total RNA was isolated from the cells using TRIZOL (Gibco). PUMA mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR analysis using a RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (MBI) and PCR kit (SBS Genetech Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). The two gene-specific primers used for amplification were as follows: (upper) gacgacctcaacgcacagta and (lower) ccagggtgtcaggaggtg. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel. Beta-actin mRNA was also amplified as an internal control. The experiment was performed twice.Western blotting analysis of PUMA, p53, Sp1, procaspase 3,9 and procaspase 8 expression Western blotting analysis was assessed according to the protocol described before[15]. In brief, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer. Protein samples (15 μg) were separated by SDS/PAGE (12% acrylamide gel) using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean III system. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and the membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with TBST. Blots were then incubated at room temperature with primary antibodies (1:500 dilution) and then primary antibodies were removed and the blots were extensively washed with TBS/Tween 20 for three times. Blots were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with the secondary antibodies (1: 2000 dilution). Then blots were extensively washed as above for 1 hour and developed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence detection system and quantified using the GeneTools systems.siRNA transfection siRNA transfection was performed according to the manufacture's instructions. In brief, LoVo cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 per well in 2 ml antibiotic-free 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS in a six well tissue plate. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a CO2 incubator until the cells were 70% confluent. siRNA duplex solution (6 μl of siRNA duplex in 100 μl siRNA Transfection Medium) was added directly to the dilute Transfection Reagent (6 μl of siRNA Transfection Reagent in 100 μl siRNA Transfection Medium). The mixture was mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then the mixture and 0.8 ml siRNA Transfection Medium were mixed and added to the cells. The cells were incubated 6 hours and the mixture was removed. H2O2 (0.64 mM) was added 24 hours later and remained for 15 minutes. Western blotting analysis was performed 48 hours post-transfection.Hoechst 33258 staining for apoptosis For analysis of apoptosis by nuclear staining with Hoechst dye 33258 (Sigma Chemical Co.), cells were stimulated according to experimental protocols, washed once with PBS, and then fixed with pre-cooled methanol 500 μl/well for 10 minutes. After fixation, cells were washed once with PBS, stained with 1 μM Hoechst dye 33258 for 10 minutes, and then washed once with PBS and distilled water. Apoptosis was indicated by the presence of condensed or fragmented nuclei which bind the Hoechst dye 33258 with high affinity. For analysis of cell structure by photomicroscopy, coverslips were washed once with PBS and then inverted and mounted on to glass slides. Cells were visualized using an Olympus microscope. Two hundred cells in three randomly chosen fields were counted and scored for the incidence of apoptotic chromatin changes under fluorescence microscopy.Statistical analysis All data are presented as mean values ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. Comparison of the effects of various treatments was performed using factor analysis, one-way ANOVA analysis of variance and a two-tailed t-test. Difference with a p value of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsH2O2 induces time- and dose-dependent PUMA expression and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells To assess the effects of H2O2 on PUMA expression, we exposed LoVo cells to a dose range of H2O2 at different time points, and we measured PUMA expression by Western blotting analysis 24 hours later. Exposure to H2O2 was found to induce PUMA expression significantly already after 5 minutes. A maximal upregualtion by approximately 50% was observed after 15 minutes (Figure 1A). A dose-range identified that H2O2 induced PUMA expression maximally at a concentration of 0.64 mM (Figure 1B).Figure 1 H2O2 induced PUMA expression and apoptosis in a time-and dose-dependent manner in colorectal cancer cells. (A) LoVo Cells were treated with 0.64 mM H2O2 at different time point and PUMA expression was assessed by Western blotting analysis. (B) Western blotting analysis of a dose-range of a 15 minute H2O2 exposure of LoVo cells. Data was presented as the percentage of the basal level of PUMA expression (control = 100%) in the absence of H2O2 and expressed as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. (C, D) LoVo Cells were treated with a time- and dose- range of H2O2 as indicated in Figure 1C, D, apoptosis was assessed by Hoechst dye 33258. Data was presented as the number of apoptosis per 200 cells in three different areas. Statistical significance as compared to control cells (*p < 0.05, #p > 0.05). To assess the effects of H2O2 on apoptosis in colorectal cancer, we exposed LoVo cells to a dose range of H2O2 at different time points, and we measured apoptosis by Hoechst 33258 dye 24 hours later. As shown in Figure 1C, H2O2-induced apoptosis increased significantly at 15 minutes and decreased after 30 minutes. And apoptosis increased significantly when LoVo cells were treated for 15 minutes with 0.64 mM and 0.80 mM of H2O2. (Figure 1D).H2O2 up-regulates PUMA expression at the transcriptional level in colorectal cancer cells To investigate whether H2O2 increases PUMA expression at the mRNA level, we treated LoVo cells with a dose and time range of H2O2 and performed a standard RT-PCR experiment. As seen in Figure 2A and 2B, H2O2 increased PUMA mRNA in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Therefore, the data suggested that H2O2 up-regulated PUMA expression at transcriptional level.Figure 2 H2O2 regulated PUMA expression at transcriptional level. (A, B) Dose and time response of LoVo cells treated with H2O2. PUMA mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR using 0.5 μg total RNA. Beta-actin mRNA was amplified as an internal control. (C) LoVo cells were transiently transfected with the -336/+157 PUMA-luc reporter plasmid (0.5 μg). H2O2 (0.64 mM) was added to the indicated samples 24 hours post-transfection and exposure was continued for 15 minutes. The pSVβ-Galactosidase plasmid (0.1 μg) was included in each sample for normalization of transfection variability. Luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates 48 hours following the transfection and the values (mean ± SD, *p < 0.05) from at least two independent expression performed in duplicate are shown in the form of a bargraph. Activation of p53 by e.g. DNA-damaging agents is followed by an induction of PUMA expression, leading to enhanced recruitment of endogenous p53 protein to the PUMA gene promoter. To test this, we used a -336/+157 PUMA-Luc reporter plasmid, which contains a set of 10 potential binding sites for Sp family proteins in the proximal region between nucleotides-120 and 18, flanked by two p53-recognition sequences at the 5' end between nucleotides -229/-209 and -145/-126. LoVo cells were transfected with this vector, 24 hours before H2O2 (0.64 mM) was added. As shown in Figure 2C, a significant transactivation of this promoter was observed after exposure to H2O2 for 15 minutes. These results suggest that H2O2 can influence endogenous PUMA levels by regulating PUMA promoter activity.H2O2-induced apoptosis is abrogated by suppression of PUMA expression To investigate whether PUMA is required for cells to undergo apoptosis, we made use of LoVo PUMA_AS cells, are stable cell line with low expression of PUMA[15]. We reasoned that these cells may differentially respond to oxidative stress as compared with their normal counterparts (colorectal cancer LoVo cells). As shown in Figure 3, induction of apoptosis by H2O2 is significantly hampered in LoVo PUMA_AS cells, as compared with induction in control LoVo cells (p < 0.05).Figure 3 Suppression of PUMA expression abrogated the apoptosis induced by H2O2. LoVo PUMA wild-type cells and LoVo PUMA_AS cells were treated with H2O2 (0.64 mM) for 15 minutes and allowed to recover for 24 hours. Hoechst dye 33258 was used to detect apoptosis. Data are presented as mean number of apoptotic cells (mean ± SD) from three independent experiments. Significant difference between LoVo PUMA wild-type cells and LoVo PUMA_AS cells is indicated by * (p < 0.05).Sp1 is required for the transactivation of the human PUMA promoter by p53 The promoter of PUMA gene contains a cluster of GC-rich motifs flanked by two p53-recognition motifs at the 5' end. The p53 sites are located at distal regions relative to the proximal Sp1 sites. The family member Sp1 has been shown to mediate oxidative stress-induced gene transcription. To determine the role of Sp1 in H2O2-induced PUMA expression, we examined the activity of a series of PUMA promoter truncation mutants[16] after H2O2 treatment Compared with cells transfected with -336/+157 PUMA-Luc, the transactivation level of cells transfected with -336/+157 -126/-25PUMA-Luc was lower, but the difference was not significant (p > 0.05). Transfection with the -36/+157PUMA-Luc vector induced a significant decrease of transactivation (#p < 0.05, Figure 4A).Figure 4 Sp1 is required for the transactivation of the human PUMA promotor by H2O2. (A) LoVo cells were transiently transfected with reporter plasmids (0.5 μg). 0.64 mM H2O2 was added 24 hours post-transfection for 15 minutes. The pSVβ-Galactosidase plasmid (0.1 μg) was included in each sample for normalization of transfection variability. Luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates 48 hours following the transfection and the values (mean ± SD), from at least two independent experiments performed in duplicate (*p > 0.05,-336/+157 -126/-25PUMA-Luc vs-136/+157 PUMA-Luc, #p < 0.05,-36/+157PUMA-Luc vs-336/+157 -126/-25PUMA-Luc). (B) Mithr.A (200 ng/ml) was added to LoVo cells. Extracts from the treated or untreated LoVo cells were subjected to immunoblotting using antibodies against p53, Sp1 and actin. (C) LoVo cells were treated with 20 μM PFT-α and/or 200 ng/ml Mithr.A an hour before 0.64 mM H2O2 added. Cell extracts were analysed for the expression of endogenous p53, Sp1 and actin as indicated by immunoblotting. (D, E) LoVo and HCT 116 cells were treated with 20 μM PFT-α and/or 200 ng/ml Mithr.A an hour before 0.64 mM H2O2 added. Cell extracts were analysed for the expression of PUMA as indicated by immunoblotting. (F) H2O2 -induced PUMA expression was abrogated by transfecting Sp1 siRNA. LoVo cells were transfected with control siRNA or Sp1 siRNA and H2O2 was added 24 hours post-transfection. PUMA expression was detected by Western blotting analysis 48 hours post-transfection. (G) LoVo cells were transiently transfected with the -336/+157 PUMA-Luc reporter plasmid, 0.64 mM H2O2 was added 24 hours post-transfection and remained for 15 minutes. Mithr.A (200 ng/ml) and/or PFT-α (20 μM) was added an hour before H2O2. Luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates 48 hours following the transfection and the values (mean ± SD.) from at least two in dependent expression performed in duplicate are shown in the form of a bargraph, *p < 0.05, significant difference between cells treated as indicated in Figure 4G, # p > 0.05, no significant difference between cells treated as indicated in Figure 4G (factor analysis, n = 6). PFT-α is a stable, water soluble inhibitor of p53-dependent apoptosis and was also shown to reduce the activation of p53-regulated genes [17]. Mithramycin A (Mithr.A) is a drug which has been clinically used in the therapies of several type of cancer and Paget's disease. It binds to GC-rich regions in chromatin and interferes with the transcription of genes that bear GC-rich motifs in their promoters including Sp1[18]. Previous study suggested that Mithr.A also activates endogenous p53 protein and has no effect on the expression of endogenous Sp1 genes. To identify the effects of Mithr.A on p53 and Sp1 expression, Mithr.A (200 ng/ml) was added to LoVo cells 24 hours before p53 and Sp1 expression was assessed by Western blotting analysis. As shown in Figure 4B, Mithr.A had no effects on p53 expression, but suppressed the expression of Sp1. Mithr.A also abrogated the Sp1 expression induced by H2O2 (Figure 4C). Similarly, PFT-α (20 μM) abrogated p53 expression induced by H2O2. To determine the effects of Mithr.A and PFT-α on PUMA expression, Mithr.A and PFT-α were added an hour before H2O2 treatment. As shown in Figure 4D, PUMA expression was found to be suppressed by exposure to Mithr.A as well as to PFT-α, and more markedly when both compounds were combined. To determine whether these effects were cell-specific, we also assessed PUMA expression in HCT116 cells and gained the same results (Figure 4E). To confirm the role of Sp1 in H2O2-induced PUMA expression furthermore, we suppressed Sp1 expression by transfecting Sp1 siRNA and our data suggested that Sp1 siRNA abrogated H2O2-induced PUMA expression (Figure 4F). To understand the mechanism of Mithr.A and PFT-α action, we tested the ability of Mithr.A and PFT-α to inhibit PUMA promoter activation induced by H2O2. As shown in Figure 4G, Mithr.A caused a decrease in PUMA promoter activity induced by H2O2 but the difference was not significant (p < 0.05). PFT-α, in contrast, caused a significant decrease in PUMA expression (p < 140.05). Combination of PFT-α and Mithr.A caused a significant enhancement of decrease in PUMA promoter activity (p < 0.05). Factor analysis (n = 6) indicated that Mithr.A and PFT-α have synergistic effects on H2O2-induced PUMA promoter activation (F = 5.480, p = 0.030).H2O2-induced apoptosis is abrogated by Mithr.A and PFT-α through a mitochondrial pathway To test whether a decrease in the expression of PUMA contributed to a decrease in the apoptosis of the cells, apoptosis assays were performed. We assessed the impact of Mithr.A and PFT-α treatment on H2O2-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. As shown in Figure 5A, Mithr.A caused a decrease in H2O2-induced apoptosis but the difference was not significant with untreated cells, while PFT-α caused a significant decrease. Compared with PFT-α alone, treatment with the combination of both compounds caused a significant decrease in H2O2-induced apoptosis.Figure 5 PFT-α and Mithr.A decreased H2O2-induced apoptosis in a mitochondrial pathway. (A) LoVo cells were treated with PFT-α (20 μM), Mithr.A (200 ng/ml) an hour before H2O2 (0.64 mM) was added. Hoechst dye 33258 was used to detect apoptosis (* represents significance p < 0.05, # represents significance p > 0.05). (B) LoVo cells were treated with PFT-α (20 μM), Mithr.A (200 ng/ml) an hour before H2O2 (0.64 mM) was added. Total extracts were then prepared and assayed for the level of the protein by immunoblot. Similar results were observed in two separate experiments. PUMA is a mitochondrial protein involved in apoptosis in a mitochondrial pathway, leading to activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 but not caspase 8. To assess the impact of Mithr.A and PFT-α treatment on these events, total cell extracts were prepared from H2O2, Mithr.A and PFT-α treated cells, and procaspase 3, procaspase 9 and procaspase 8 levels were monitored by Western blotting analysis. As shown in Figure 5B, increased levels of procaspase 3 and 9 were observed in Mithr.A and PFT-α treated cells, while effects on procaspase 8 were absent.Discussion The generation of large amounts of reactive oxygen intermediates may contribute to the ability of some tumors to mutate, inhibit antiproteases and injure local tissues [19]. On the other hand, the production of ROS during the catabolism of tumor and chemotherapy leads to apoptosis and benefits in the process of the clearance of tumor cells. In the present study, we found that H2O2 up-regulated PUMA expression and induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer LoVo cells. Suppression of PUMA expression abrogated H2O2-induced apoptosis. To further elucidate the mechanism responsible for the changes in amounts of PUMA, we determined levels of PUMA mRNA by RT-PCR. Our data suggested that PUMA expression at the mRNA level increased and transcription activity of PUMA was upregulated by administration of H2O2 especially at doses between 0.04 and 0.64 mM in colorectal cancer LoVo cells. PUMA is essential in the process of apoptosis induction by exogenous or endogenous p53 [20-22]. However, many studies described that there were other factors involved in the regulation of PUMA expression, either in a p53-dependent or independent manner including our previous report. For example, Tzippi et al [23] reported E2F1 upregulated the expression of PUMA through a direct transcriptional mechanism and increased PUMA levels mediated E2F1-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Koutsodontis et al [16] found that the PUMA promoter contains a cluster of GC-rich motifs flanked by two p53-recognition motifs and a series of Sp1 recognition sites at the 5'-end. This was identified by searching the 5'-flanking sequence of PUMA with Tfsearch software . The same report also suggests that the Sp family was essential for the cellular response to p53 activation by genotoxic stress such as ROS [24,25]. This urged us to hypothesize that Sp1 plays a role in H2O2-induced PUMA expression and apoptosis. To investigate the role of Sp1 on H2O2-induced PUMA expression, Mithr.A (a DNA-binding antitumor agent) [26] and PFT-α (a selective p53 inhibitor), were used for pharmacological intervention both in LoVo cells (p53 mutation) and HCT116 cells (p53 wide type). Sp1 siRNA was also used to confirm the result. Our data suggest that Sp1 plays a role in H2O2-induced PUMA expression and regulated it at the transcriptional level. This regulation is not cell specific in LoVo cells and HCT116 cells. To determine whether H2O2 could induce PUMA expression in p53 mutant cell lines, we detect the expression of PUMA in H2O2-treated SW480 cells(p53 mutated colorectal cancer cells) and LoVo p53- cells (established in our previous study). Our data showed that no much difference was found in H2O2 -treated cells and untreated cells (data not show) and this induction was p53-dependent. Sp1 and p53 could regulate PUMA expression synergistically in H2O2-treated LoVo colorectal cancer cells. More interesting, Mithr.A was used as an antitumor agent and has been used in the clinic for several types of cancer. Lee et al [27] reported that it sensitized cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by down-regulation of XIAP gene promoter through Sp1 sites. Our data suggest that Mithr.A decreases apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells through inhibiting PUMA promoter activity, which may limit the application of Mithr.A in colorectal cancer therapy. To assess whether inhibiting Sp1 binding to the PUMA promoter by Mithr.A contributed to a decrease of apoptosis induced by H2O2, Hoechst dye 33258 staining was carried out. Our data showed that combination of Mithr.A and PFT-α abrogated H2O2-induced apoptosis significantly better, as compared with PFT-α alone. PUMA induction results in Bax multimerizaion, mitochondia-dependent death, the release of cytochrome C and caspase 9 induction leading to apoptosis [14]. Our data showed an increase in expression of procaspase 3, procaspase 9 and suggested an decrease of caspase 3 and 9. Therefore, Sp1 activity may be functionally linked to the effects of H2O2 on PUMA. In summary, a novel mechanism of PUMA stimulation by H2O2 in colorectal cancer LoVo cells has been demonstrated. The results suggest that H2O2-induced up-regulation of PUMA is partly due to Sp1 transcription factor except for p53. These results may provide an insight into the molecular control of H2O2-induced PUMA expression in colorectal cancer cells through Sp1 binding sites.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributions WXY carried out Western blotting analysis, Hoechst 33258 staining for apoptosis, Statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.

American Diabetes Association	1536	diabetes|Diabetes	Diabetes	Obesity-Associated Hepatosteatosis and Impairment of Glucose Homeostasis Are Attenuated by Haptoglobin Deficiency	Haptoglobin (Hp) is upregulated in both inflammation and obesity. The low chronic inflammatory state, caused by massive adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) infiltration found in obesity, and low adiponectin have been implicated in the development of insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis. The aim of this work was to investigate whether and how Hp interferes with the onset of obesity-associated complications. Hp-null (Hp−/−) and wild-type (WT) mice were metabolically profiled under chow-food diet (CFD) and high-fat diet (HFD) feeding by assessing physical parameters, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, insulin response to glucose load, liver triglyceride content, plasma levels of leptin, insulin, glucose, and adiponectin. ATM content was evaluated by using immunohistochemistry (anti-F4/80 antibody). Adiponectin expression was measured in Hp-treated, cultured 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes. No genotype-related difference was found in CFD animals. HFD-Hp−/− mice revealed significantly higher glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and adiponectin expression and reduced hepatomegaly/steatosis compared with HFD-WT mice. White adipose tissue (WAT) of HFD-Hp−/− mice showed higher activation of insulin signaling cascade, lower ATM, and higher adiponectin expression. Hp was able to inhibit adiponectin expression in cultured adipocytes. We demonstrated that in the absence of Hp, obesity-associated insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis are attenuated, which is associated with reduced ATM content, increased plasma adiponectin, and higher WAT insulin sensitivity.

White adipose tissue (WAT) of HFD-Hp−/− mice showed higher activation of insulin signaling cascade, lower ATM, and higher adiponectin expression. Hp was able to inhibit adiponectin expression in cultured adipocytes. We demonstrated that in the absence of Hp, obesity-associated insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis are attenuated, which is associated with reduced ATM content, increased plasma adiponectin, and higher WAT insulin sensitivity. Haptoglobin (Hp) is a circulating tetrameric glycoprotein and is considered a classic clinical marker of the liver acute phase response to inflammation. Diversified functions have been attributed to this circulating protein, including angiogenic capacity, the ability to bind free hemoglobin, and, as recently demonstrated by the authors, an important chemotactic activity for monocytes in vitro (1–3). Hp is also abundantly expressed by white adipose tissue (WAT) (4,5), which is one of those few inflammatory molecules specifically produced by the adipocyte and not present in the stromal vascular fraction (6,7). Obesity has been recently defined as a low chronic inflammatory state, and this has been implicated in the development of common medically important complications, including hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis (8–10). Classic markers of the obesity-induced inflammatory state include the augmented circulating levels of proinflammatory proteins, procoagulant factors, cytokines, and chemokines. The molecular and cytologic alterations taking place in WAT on obesity play a determinant role in this phenomenon. Obesity is in fact associated with increased infiltration of macrophages in WAT, and this certainly contributes to the inflammatory-like gene expression pattern displayed by the WAT of obese individuals. The mechanisms underlying macrophages recruitment are still a matter of investigation and likely involve increased secretion of chemotactic molecules by the adipocytes. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and its receptor C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) have been considered the main players in this process (11,12). Recent work by the authors demonstrates that Hp induces CCR2 internalization and that pharmacologic inhibition of CCR2 abolishes monocytes migration toward Hp (2). As we previously reported, WAT Hp expression is induced in obesity and the circulating levels of the glycoprotein are significantly related to the degree of adiposity in humans (4,5). The depicted scenario thus far led to the consideration of Hp as a novel adipokine (5) and a further intersection between obesity and inflammation. However, if its role in the latter condition has long been established and characterized, its role in metabolism and WAT has yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated how variations in Hp expression might be relevant to metabolism and to WAT expression and inflammatory profile. These issues were investigated in mice by using the Hp-null (Hp−/−) model, for which no metabolic characterization had been carried out (13). Our findings indicate that on the onset of obesity, Hp deficiency confers a partial protection against impaired glucose homeostasis and hepatomegaly/steatosis and that these features are associated with increased adiponectin and reduced WAT macrophage infiltration.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSExperimental animals. Hp−/− mice were generated previously (13). Mice were fed a chow-food diet (CFD) (2018 Teklad Global Diet; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) or high-fat diet (HFD) (Diet F3282, 19% protein, 36% fat, and 35% carbohydrate [gram per weight]; Bio-Serve, Frenchtown, NJ) for 12 weeks (Supplementary Appendix A1). Serum, epididymal (EPI) WAT, subcutaneous (SC) WAT and perirenal fat pads, brown adipose tissue (BAT), kidney, and liver were dissected from fasted animals, weighed, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture and from the tail vein (in live animals). The experimental protocols followed the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care and a specific authorization by the Italian Ministry of Education (114/2003-A of 16/09/2003) .Ex vivo cultures and primary adipocytes. Tissue explants of visceral WAT, liver, and kidney from wild-type (WT) mice (5 months old, mean body weight [BW] 26.5 g) were isolated, cut into small pieces, and incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with antibiotics and 2% BSA at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Aliquots of the medium were taken at different time points. Hp concentration at time point 0 was considered as baseline and subtracted from values obtained afterward. Primary adipocytes were prepared as described (14). After isolation, human adipocytes (Supplementary Appendix A2) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were treated with human Hp (1 mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 24 h and collected at the end of treatment.Culture and treatment of 3T3-L1. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated in adipocytes as described previously (15). After differentiation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with BSA or Hp at different concentrations for 24 h and finally collected.Isolation of total RNA and real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissues (WAT, liver, and BAT) or from cells and retro-transcribed as described previously (14). TaqMan quantitative PCR was performed on an ABI-PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) using Tata-binding protein as an endogenous control. Predesigned mouse primers and probes were obtained from Applied Biosystems.Microarray analysis. The gene expression profiling was performed using the One-Color Microarray Agilent Platform (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) according to the Agilent protocol (Agilent 8 × 60 K whole mouse genome oligonucleotide microarrays, G4852A) (Supplementary Appendix A3). Data extraction from the Agilent scanner images was accomplished by Feature Extraction software. Data filtering and analysis were performed using Agilent GeneSpring GX 11.0 and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). Filtered data were quantile-normalized. Differentially expressed genes were selected by Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test. Hierarchic clustering analysis was done using MeV 4.4 (16).Glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and ELISA. Glucose tolerance was measured in fasted (16 h) mice after intraperitoneal injection (intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test) of 1 g glucose/kg BW. Insulin sensitivity was measured in fasted (6 h) animals after intraperitoneal injection (intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test) of 1.2 units/kg insulin BW. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was performed as described by Nguyen et al. (17). Plasma glucose was measured using a glucometer (LifeScan, Inc., Milpitas, CA). ELISA kits were used to assess plasma levels of insulin (Millipore, Billerica, MA), leptin (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), adiponectin, and Hp (R&D Systems, Inc.; Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Inc., Newberg, OR).In vivo insulin signaling. Fasted mice (6 h) were injected with insulin (10 units/kg BW) and killed 10 min thereafter. Tissues were then promptly collected. After homogenization in ice-cold lysis buffer (Supplementary Appendix A4), lysates were centrifuged at 14,000g for 20 min at 4°C. Supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Criterion, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Phosphorylated and total proteins were identified by immunoblotting using the following primary antibodies: anti-Akt polyclonal and anti–phospho-Akt (Ser(P)473) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA), and antiactin (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoblots were developed using the Immun-Star HRP kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and densitometric analysis was performed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories).Oil Red O staining and liver triglyceride content. To visualize the fat droplet accumulation, frozen liver tissue sections were stained with Oil Red O. To assess triglyceride content, liver samples were homogenized in 5% Triton X-100 in water. Samples were heated at 92°C for 5 min, cooled to room temperature, and spun at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. Supernatants were used to assay triglyceride concentration using the Triglyceride Quantification Kit (BioVision, Inc., Mountain View, CA).Histology and immunohistochemistry. EPI, SC fat pads, and BAT were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin (Supplementary Appendix A5). BAT sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. EPI and SC (5-μm sections) were stained for F4/80 antibody (AbD Serotec, Kidlington, U.K.) and revealed by DAB (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin.Statistical analysis. All values are expressed as means ± SEM. Pairwise comparisons of quantitative phenotypes between different groups (e.g., HFD-WT vs. HFD-Hp−/−) were assessed by two-tailed Student t test. When specified, one- or two-way ANOVA was used, followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests for selected comparisons.RESULTSHp release by mouse WAT. According to Fain et al. (7), explants of human WAT release Hp into the medium. We wanted to verify whether mouse WAT displayed this same capacity. The release of Hp by EPI WAT explants was fairly linear over the incubation time (Fig. 1A). We then wanted to compare the release of Hp from WAT with that from liver, considered the main source for this glycoprotein (18), and from kidney, which conversely exhibits very low Hp expression (4). Over 24 h, liver was the greatest producer of Hp, and Hp production in WAT was significantly higher than in kidney (Fig. 1B). These results rule out the possibility that what was detected in the medium was due to the spill-over of Hp contained in excised vessels, because a comparable amount of released Hp would be expected from all examined tissues. On the basis of these data, we calculated that the average daily release of Hp from visceral WAT and liver is 256 ± 92 and 660 ± 88 ng/g tissue per day, respectively. By taking into account that visceral WAT represents ∼13% of the BW of an animal (the average BW of these animals is 26.5 g) and that the average liver weight is 1.5 g, the total Hp daily production can be estimated to attain 0.88 μg for visceral WAT and 0.99 μg for liver. Such an estimate for WAT contribution to circulating Hp is in the lower range, not including the Hp production by SC WAT.FIG. 1. Hp release into the medium by mouse tissue explants. A: Hp release from mouse EPI WAT is shown at 3, 12, 24, and 48 h. One-way ANOVA: P < 0.01. B: Hp release from mouse liver (circle), EPI WAT (square), and kidney (triangle) is shown at 3, 12, and 24 h. Two-way ANOVA: time effect P < 0.0001, tissue effect P < 0.0001, interaction P < 0.0001. Bonferroni post hoc tests at 24 h: EPI WAT vs. liver ***P < 0.001; EPI WAT vs. kidney §§P < 0.01, liver vs. kidney °°°P < 0.001. Data are expressed as means ± SEM of five experiments. To rule out the possibility that the Hp release measured in mouse WAT explants was due to other cell types or to continuous and progressive spill-over from vessels trapped in the tissue, Hp concentration was assessed in the medium where primary mouse adipocytes had been cultured for 6 h. Hp was present in this medium at a concentration of 22.2 ± 1.9 ng/mL/106 cells. Although this value cannot be easily transformed into Hp release per gram of tissue, because a variable number of cells are lost during cell isolation and preparation, this result definitely establishes that adipocytes themselves are able to release Hp.HFD results in increased Hp production in mice. We previously demonstrated that serum Hp is directly related to adiposity in humans (5). To investigate this aspect in mice, a group of WT mice was exposed to an HFD on which animals gained ∼88% of their initial BW. Serum Hp was then assessed before and after HFD treatment, and a significant increase of serum Hp of approximately threefold was observed (Fig. 2A). Hp gene expression, as assessed by real-time PCR, was significantly higher in the EPI WAT but not in the liver of obese mice compared with lean mice (Fig. 2B and C). Taken together, these results suggest that in murine obesity Hp gene expression is specifically induced in WAT.FIG. 2. HFD treatment results in increased Hp production. A: Hp plasma levels in lean (n = 7) and obese (n = 7) WT mice. B: Hp WAT mRNA abundance in lean and obese WT mice. C: Hp liver mRNA abundance in lean and obese WT mice. Student t test: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. Data are expressed as means ± SEM.Physical parameters and plasma biochemistry of Hp−/− mice. To investigate the role of Hp in metabolism, an in vivo loss of function approach was undertaken. Adult Hp−/− mice and WT controls were analyzed under two different diet regimens, namely, CFD and HFD. HFD resulted in a significant increase in BW in both Hp−/− and WT animals compared with CFD-treated mice. No genotype effect was observed: WT and Hp−/− mice showed similar BW on a regular diet and did not differ in their susceptibility to gain weight when fed an HFD (Table 1). Weights of EPI and perirenal fat pads consistently were affected by diet but not by genotype (Fig. 3A and B). Likewise, BAT size was increased (independently of genotype) in HFD-treated mice (Fig. 3C). Histologic examination revealed that interscapular BAT of HFD-treated mice was composed mainly of hypertrophic unilocular cells as opposed to lean mice in which typical multilocular cells predominate (Fig. 3D), which is in line with other investigations (19–21). When concentrations of fasting glucose, insulin, and leptin were assessed, a diet effect was observed, but not a genotype effect (Table 1).TABLE 1 Physical and metabolic parameters in WT and Hp−/− mice under CFD and HFD treatmentCFDHFDWT (n = 15)Hp−/− (n = 23)WT (n = 24)Hp−/− (n = 30)Body weight (g)27.36 ± 0.5627.12 ± 0.3042.29 ± 0.9841.96 ± 0.54Insulin (ng/mL)0.88 ± 0.080.82 ± 0.092.35 ± 0.232.49 ± 0.26Glucose (mg/dL)148.78 ± 7.31135.67 ± 8.02235.23 ± 12.23212.37 ± 7.02Leptin (ng/mL)2.8 ± 0.53.6 ± 0.974.1 ± 9.0*89.7 ± 16.0† Data are expressed as means ± SEM.

Animals were challenged with an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. No genotype effect was observed in CFD-treated animals. (Fig. 4A). On HFD, WT mice exhibited an important glucose intolerance with no sign of glycemia decreasing at 120 min after glucose stimulus. This effect was attenuated in Hp−/− mice, for which a decrease, albeit moderate, was observed at 120 min. This is mirrored in the significantly lower value of the area under the curve exhibited by HFD-Hp−/− mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 4B). Of importance, HFD-Hp−/− mice displayed a clear glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, as opposed to WT mice, which showed no response (Fig. 4C).FIG. 4.

Mice (n = 3–4 per group) were fasted for 6 h, injected intraperitoneally with saline or insulin at 10 units/kg BW, and killed 10 min thereafter. Insulin-stimulated Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt was assessed by immunoblotting (left). Actin served as loading control. Quantification of phosphoproteins is shown in the corresponding bar graphs (right). Phosphoproteins were normalized to the corresponding total proteins and are expressed as fold changes from relative saline-treated control . Student t test: HFD-WT vs. HFD-Hp−/− *P < 0.05. Data are expressed as means ± SEM. AUC, area under the curve; SK, skeletal. During an intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test, HFD-Hp−/− mice were slightly more insulin-sensitive than HFD-WT mice (Fig. 4D). Of interest, an insulin-induced glucose decrease persisted for a longer period in the former.Insulin action in liver, WAT, and skeletal muscle of HFD-Hp−/− mice. To better understand how global Hp deficiency contributes to define glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in HFD-treated mice, we evaluated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt Ser-473 in WAT, liver, and skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius). This was significantly enhanced in WAT and showed a trend toward increase in liver and skeletal muscle of HFD-Hp−/− mice compared with HFD-WT mice (Fig. 4E–G). Taken together, these data suggest that Hp deficiency constitutes a partial protection against the onset of obesity-associated glucose intolerance, dampened glucose-stimulated insulin production, and insulin resistance. The latter is at least partially explained by a better preserved insulin response in the WAT.Liver in lean and obese Hp−/− mice. Hp is abundantly expressed in the liver (18), and hepatosteatosis/hepatomegaly often characterizes obesity (22). Indeed, HFD-WT mice showed an important (35%) increase of their liver weight compared with CFD-WT mice. HFD treatment resulted in a less pronounced (15%, not significant) liver weight increase in Hp−/− mice (Fig. 5A).FIG. 5. Weight, triglyceride content, and gene expression in the liver of Hp−/− mice.

Data are expressed as means ± SEM. F: Microarray analysis of hepatic mRNA expression in HFD-WT and HFD-Hp−/− mice (n = 4). Left: Hierarchic clustering of 611 genes differentially expressed in the two genotypes. Right: Magnification showing 13 selected genes (see text). Nine of them were grouped in functional categories according to their biological function: apoptosis (in blue), transcription factors (in red), and lipid metabolism (in green). (A high-quality digital representation of this figure is available in the online issue.) Histological analysis revealed a lower lipid accumulation in the liver of Hp−/− mice (Fig. 5B). In line with this, triglyceride content was significantly lower in HFD-Hp−/− mice compared with HFD-WT mice (Fig. 5C and D). To investigate the mechanisms underlying the reduced triglyceride accumulation observed in the liver of obese Hp−/− mice, we measured the abundance of transcripts for 1) genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism, including the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS), the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), and the mitochondrial negative regulator of fatty acids oxidation glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (mtGPAT); and 2) two gluconeogenesis rate-limiting enzymes, namely, PEPCK and glucose-6 phosphatase (G6Pase). FAS, SREBP, mtGPAT, PEPCK, and G6Pase were downregulated by 66, 13, 53, 32, and 38%, respectively, in the liver of HFD-Hp−/− mice (Fig. 5E) compared with HFD-WT mice, which is consistent with decreased lipid synthesis, increased fatty acids β oxidation (23), and diminished gluconeogenesis (24). Microarray analysis was used to better define the expression profile of HFD-Hp−/− versus HFD-WT mice. Hierarchical clustering identified WT and Hp−/− as two distinct groups. A total of 611 genes were differentially expressed, of which 573 were upregulated and 38 were downregulated in the HFD-Hp−/− (Fig. 5F). Among them, we chose to present those (Fig. 5F, right; Supplementary Appendix A6) more specifically related to liver functions/pathology and displaying more than a twofold change. Real-time PCR performed on two representative genes (cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation effector α [CIDEα] and acetyl-CoA carboxylase β [ACACβ]) confirmed microarray results (Supplementary Appendix A7). If we exclude renin, glutathione S-transferases, and cytochrome P450 CYP41, the other nine genes could be placed in three functional categories, including 1) apoptosis-related genes that include members of the serpin family (upregulated in HFD-Hp−/−) and members of the CIDE family (downregulated in HFD-Hp−/−), the former being inhibitors and the latter inducers of apoptosis; 2) genes implied in lipid metabolism (downregulated in HFD-Hp−/−); and 3) transcription factors Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF6), both associated with improved insulin sensitivity (25,26) when overexpressed and both upregulated in the absence of Hp (A6).Adiponectin is increased in HFD-Hp−/− mice. Absence of Hp results in a more benign prognosis on the onset of obesity, because hepatomegaly/steatosis and insulin resistance are attenuated. For further insights into this matter, we searched for systemic or local factors that might explain such phenotype. Adiponectin is a key factor in determining insulin sensitivity (27) because its plasma levels are inversely associated with glucose intolerance (28,29). Further, recent studies reported that hypoadiponectinemia enhances and adiponectin administration prevents steatohepatitis progression in mice (30). We investigated this parameter in our models. Although plasma adiponectin was similar in CFD-WT and CFD-Hp−/− mice, HFD-Hp−/− exhibited significantly higher levels of adiponectin compared with HFD-WT mice (Fig. 6A). We also observed a significant increase of EPI WAT adiponectin mRNA in HFD-Hp−/− versus HFD-Hp-WT mice (Fig. 6B).FIG. 6. Hp affects adiponectin expression in vivo and in vitro.

Student t test: *P < 0.05. Data are expressed as means ± SEM.Effect of Hp on adiponectin expression in vitro. To investigate whether Hp plays a direct role on adiponectin expression, we performed in vitro experiments using 3T3-L1 adipocytes and purified Hp. Treatment of terminally differentiated adipocytes with Hp at different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL) for 24 h resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of adiponectin mRNA compared with control cells treated with BSA (Fig. 6C). To rule out the possibility that Hp was exerting an aspecific effect on the adipocyte expression profile, we assessed the abundance of adipose fatty acid-binding protein-4 (aP2) mRNA in the same samples. No relevant change was determined. Hp effects on adiponectin mRNA abundance were paralleled by effects on adiponectin protein concentration in the medium. After 24 h of treatment, Hp induced a significant dose-dependent decrease of adiponectin (Fig. 6D). Of note, a downregulation of adiponectin mRNA abundance was observed also in primary human adipocytes treated with Hp (Fig. 6E). Taken together, these data indicate that Hp inhibits adiponectin expression in vitro.WAT macrophage content in Hp−/− mice. Another important determinant of the risk to develop obesity-associated complications resides in the WAT inflammatory status. Having previously proved that Hp acts as a chemoattractant in vitro (2) and that it is released by murine WAT (present study), we wanted to establish whether a deficiency of this glycoprotein could affect WAT macrophage infiltration in vivo. When HFD-treated mice were considered, a significantly lower macrophage infiltration was found in both EPI and SC WAT of Hp−/− compared with WT, as assessed by macrophage-specific surface protein F4/80 immunoreactivity (Fig. 7A and B). The abundance of macrophage-specific mRNAs (F4/80 and CD68) consistently was lower in EPI WAT of obese Hp−/− mice compared with weight-matched WT mice (Fig. 7C). No genotype-related difference was observed in the ATM content of CFD-treated mice (data not shown).FIG. 7. ATM content in HFD-Hp−/− mice. Left: Immunohistochemical detection of F4/80 in EPI WAT (A) and SC WAT (B) of HFD-WT and Hp−/− mice. Right: Bar graphs indicating F4/80 stained cells/total nuclei in EPI WAT (A) (n = 7, 15 fields per animal) and SC WAT (B) (n = 8, 15 fields per animal). F4/80 positive macrophages from each individual depot were counted using a 40× objective. The ratio of F4/80-positive cells was calculated as the number of F4/80 positive nuclei divided by the total number of nuclei in the same field. C: EPI WAT gene expression of CD68 and F4/80 in HFD-WT and Hp−/− mice. Student t test: *P < 0.05. Data are expressed as means ± SEM. (A high-quality color representation of this figure is available in the online issue.) These results are consistent with a role of Hp in contributing to WAT macrophage infiltration and consequent onset of altered inflammatory status at this site.DISCUSSION Inflammation/obesity is becoming an inseparable binomial association that has yet to be fully unraveled in terms of clinical consequences and underlying cytologic, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms. Hp, an inflammatory molecule that is upregulated in the WAT of obese subjects, constitutes an interesting tool to further explore this relationship. We demonstrated that murine WAT not only expresses but also releases Hp at levels that equal, if not overcome, the hepatic release in terms of contribution to Hp-circulating concentration. We also prove that in obese mice, which show increased serum Hp, WAT Hp expression is increased, but not liver Hp expression, suggesting that obesity induces a specific WAT Hp upregulation. These premises should be considered in the context of the better preservation of glucose homeostasis shown by the Hp-deficient model of obesity. The concept of WAT being relevant for this phenotype is reinforced by insulin signaling studies that indicate this organ as the one with the highest increase (with respect to HFD-WT mice) in insulin sensitivity, among metabolically active tissues. Lack of Hp attenuates the hepatomegaly/steatosis often associated with the obesity state. In addition to less-activated machinery for triglyceride accumulation, microarray analysis showed changes in HFD-Hp−/− liver expression profile that are consistent with lower activation of the apoptotic pathways. Apoptosis is a classic feature of hepatic steatosis progressing toward hepatitis and irreversible liver damage (31,32), and what we observe on Hp deficiency is, therefore, consistent with a phenotype that is more protected against this risk. Whether such changes in liver expression are the result of local, systemic, or both Hp actions cannot be established on the basis of the present findings. The local scenario implies an Hp autocrine effect, possibly modulating deleterious gene expression programs. According to the systemic hypothesis, the liver is healthier because of surrounding conditions of improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity, determined by other organs. In this regard, benign consequences of Hp deficiency are associated with reduced WAT macrophage infiltration and higher adiponectin levels. Both aspects imply a direct involvement of WAT, which is in line with the specific WAT Hp upregulation induced by obesity in the WT mouse. WAT dysfunction was previously associated with hepatosteatosis, and plasma Hp was defined as a prognostic marker for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in animals exposed to HFD (33). We recently reported that Hp is a chemotactic molecule (2), which is consistent with the reduced ATM infiltration observed in the obese Hp−/− mice. Macrophage infiltration in the WAT of obese individuals is related to the low chronic inflammatory state that often characterizes the obesity status. In particular, the release of inflammatory factors by macrophages, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, contributes to the onset of insulin resistance (34). Hepatic steatosis is also generally associated with the inflamed WAT: Mechanisms postulated to explain this association include a secondary effect of the altered availability of lipids generated by the insulin resistance state and a direct consequence of the altered WAT expression profile (35). As previously reported, increased fat content in the liver is independent of the degree of obesity (36) but significantly associated with WAT inflammation, and specifically with the abundance of inflammatory markers, including CD68 and MCP-1. MCP-1 was initially described as a potent chemoattractant factor (37) implicated in the recruitment of macrophages in WAT. Supporting evidence in this direction derives from the increased infiltration of macrophages observed in lean mice overexpressing MCP-1 in WAT (11) and consistently from the lower ATM content found in obese mice deficient for this factor (11) or for its receptor (CCR2) (12). In contrast, Inouye et al. (38) reported that macrophage content in the WAT of MCP-1 −/− obese mice is, if nothing, higher than that of obese controls. In no case did genetic obese models for MCP-1 or CCR2 exhibit a level of ATM normalized to that observed in lean mice, thus implying the presence of other uncovered factors in the modulation of this phenomenon. According to our previously published and currently reported evidence, Hp presents all of the features to be considered one of them. Tissue distribution differentiates MCP-1 from Hp, because abundance in WAT of the former is prevalently due (>80%) to its expression in the stromal vascular fraction (39), whereas Hp gene expression and release are almost totally confined to the adipocyte fraction (6). This strengthens the notion that the adipocyte itself is able to produce chemotactic molecules and attract macrophages both by active release and by simple spill-over in case of cell death (40). We previously demonstrated that Hp is able to internalize CCR2 in cultured monocytes and that pharmacologic inhibition of this chemokine receptor results in the abolition of Hp chemotactic activity (2), thus suggesting that Hp interacts with CCR2 to recruit macrophages. As we found for the obese Hp−/− mice, CCR2 −/− animals exposed to an HFD showed reduced ATM content, improved insulin sensitivity, reduced hepatic steatosis, and increased adiponectin (12). Obese Hp−/− mice show higher adiponectin expression compared with controls. This adipokine is considered an important player in the determination of insulin sensitivity. A large amount of evidence points to the lack of a sufficient amount of this factor as a key signal for the onset of insulin resistance (41) and for the development of hepatic steatosis. In HFD-treated mice, decreased adiponectin often precedes steatohepatitis (42) and adiponectin reverses steatosis in ob/ob mice (43). Obese Hp−/− mice exhibit higher circulating and local levels of adiponectin compared with matched WT controls, which may partly explain their improved glucose tolerance and reduced hepatosteatosis. Our observation regarding adiponectin in HFD-treated Hp−/− mice was independently proved by the inhibitory effect exerted by Hp on adiponectin expression and secretion in cultured adipocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that adiponectin is significantly downregulated by Hp, thus introducing a new player in the regulation of this adipokine. Accordingly, similar inhibitory capacities were previously reported for other inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 (44–47), also upregulated in the WAT of obese subjects. In conclusion, we have established that Hp not only marks the intersection between obesity and inflammation but also actively contributes to the WAT inflammatory profile often found in obese subjects and to the downregulation of adiponectin. These features may explain the phenotype of the obese Hp−/− mouse that is partially protected from the onset of obesity-associated complications, including severe insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis/hepatomegaly.

A double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled study was conducted in 120 healthy male and female volunteers (NCT00903747). Volunteers were randomized to receive prucalopride 2–10 mg once daily (therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses, respectively) (group 1), placebo with 400 mg moxifloxacin on day 1 (group 2a), or placebo with moxifloxacin on day 15 (group 2b). Twelve-lead 24 h Holter ECGs recorded at various time-points were evaluated blind and centrally. Estimated mean difference in study specific corrected QT interval (QTcSS) time-matched change from baseline between prucalopride (2 and 10 mg) and placebo was <5 ms at all time points (maximum mean difference: 3.83 ms at 3.5 h post dose on day 5 with 2 mg [90% Cl −0.33, 6.38 ms]). Upper limits of the two-sided 90% CI for QTcSS were all <10 ms. There were no outlying QTcSS values >450 ms and no subjects had an increase >60 ms following prucalopride. Moxifloxacin produced the expected significant changes in QTcSS (>5 ms, maximum of +12.7 ms at 5 h post dose) at all time-points except 1 h post dose. Prucalopride resulted in small increases in heart rate (maximum of 5.8 beats min–1), which were similar for 2 and 10 mg. Prucalopride was well tolerated after first day of treatment. Prucalopride at both therapeutic and supra therapeutic doses has no clinically significant effects on cardiac repolarisation in healthy volunteers.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT Drugs interacting with the hERG potassium channel are associated with a prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Early prokinetic agents, such as cisapride, display poor selectivity for their target receptor, 5-HT4, also interacting with hERG channels and, as a consequence, have a poor safety and benefit/risk profile. Prucalopride, a novel and selective 5-HT4 agonist with enterokinetic activity, is indicated for the treatment of chronic constipation in adults in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief.WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS This study describes the results of a novel thorough QT study design involving a parallel group with nested crossover for positive control. The mean QTc interval was not prolonged in patients receiving therapeutic (2 mg) or supra-therapeutic (10 mg) doses of prucalopride, as assessed using QTcSS. New generation prokinetic agents with improved selectivity for 5-HT4 receptors, such as prucalopride, should help improve the benefit/risk profile of these agents and, ultimately, their clinical usefulness.Introduction Prucalopride (Resolor®) is a novel enterokinetic agent. It is the first of a new generation of selective, high-affinity 5-HT4 receptor agonists [1–3]. This drug, which has been developed for the treatment of chronic constipation in adults in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief, stimulates gastrointestinal (GI) motility through its effects on 5-HT4 receptors [1, 3]. Clinical data, including those from three identical pivotal phase III studies, have demonstrated that 2 mg prucalopride once daily is effective in increasing stool frequency, reducing constipation-related symptoms and improving quality of life [4–6]. Concerns about possible cardiovascular effects of enterokinetic agents arose a few years ago, prompting market withdrawal and restrictions for the use of cisapride and tegaserod, in 2003 and 2006, respectively. It is now commonly accepted that there should be a 30-fold separation (or safety margin) between maximum unbound drug concentrations in humans and the human ether a-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium channel half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), to reduce the potential risk of cardiac pro-arrhythmia such as torsade de pointes [7]. In contrast with cisapride, which has a margin of less than 10-fold between its affinity for 5-HT4 and hERG channels (binding studies), prucalopride at its therapeutic dose is more than 200 times more selective for 5-HT4 than for the hERG channels [2]. With regard to functional tests measuring hERG currents, cisapride has no discernable safety margin between its hERG IC50 and its therapeutic concentration [7]. Conversely, prucalopride blocks hERG channels with an IC50 value ranging between 4.1 and 22 µm[8, 9], which is equivalent to a safety margin of at least 200 times the therapeutic plasma concentration and, as such, significantly exceeds the recommended threshold of 30-fold IC50[7]. Furthermore, there is no evidence of ECG irregularities or cardiac arrhythmias in healthy volunteer or clinical studies [1, 3–5, 10–15], including studies in elderly patients with previous cardiovascular history [16]. The main objective of this thorough QT study was to evaluate the cardiac safety of prucalopride in accordance with the ICH E14 guideline, by assessing its effect on the QT interval when administered to healthy volunteers at therapeutic (2 mg) and supratherapeutic (10 mg) doses [17, 18]. The supratherapeutic dose used in this study was assessed and found to be safe in a previous phase I cardiac safety study, and is likely to be the maximum dose tolerated in the majority of healthy volunteers (unpublished data). This dose, however, has to be titrated in order to be tolerated, which led to a novel thorough QT study design involving a parallel group with nested crossover for positive control, thereby reducing the number of subjects by half. In accordance with the E14 guideline, a positive control, moxifloxacin (400 mg), was included to establish the sensitivity of the study to detect relevant small changes in the QT interval [17].MethodsSubjects The study (NCT00903747) enrolled 120 healthy male and female non-smoking volunteers aged 18–50 years, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18–30 kg m−2 and body weight of ≥50 kg. Eligible volunteers were in good health (determined by physical examination, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory evaluations), had a normal ECG and no clinically significant medical history. Concomitant medications were not allowed, except for paracetamol up to 3 × 500 mg day−1 and no more than 3 g week−1. All volunteers gave written informed consent prior to any study related procedures. The study was approved by an independent Ethics Committee (Welwyn Clinical Pharmacology Ethics Committee, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK) and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1996 version), Good Clinical Practice guidelines and other applicable regulatory requirements.Study design This was a phase I, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled parallel group/crossover study. A single oral dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin was included as a positive control, by means of a crossover design nested within the placebo arm of the parallel group design. Volunteers were randomized to one of three treatment groups: group 1 (prucalopride, 2 mg tablets manufactured by Sanico NV, Turnhout, Belgium), group 2a or group 2b (placebo/moxifloxacin [Avelox®, Bayer HealthCare AG, Leverkusen, Germany]). Subjects in group 1 received a once daily dose of 2 mg prucalopride on days 1 to 5, after which dosing escalated by 2 mg day−1 to a maximum dose of 10 mg on day 9, and continued once daily dosing with 10 mg prucalopride on days 10 to 13. Subjects also received a single dose of placebo (in packaging identical to that of moxifloxacin) on days 1 and 15, to ensure blinding of moxifloxacin intake in groups 2a and 2b. Subjects in groups 2a and 2b received a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin on day 1 or day 15, respectively, and placebo tablets matching the group 1 prucalopride dosing on days 1 to 13, as well as a single dose of placebo (in packaging identical to that of moxifloxacin) on day 15 or day 1, for groups 2a and 2b, respectively. No dose was administered on day 14. Volunteers remained in the study centre from day −2 until day 16. Randomization was performed using a randomly permuted 2:1:1 block allocation scheme for groups 1, 2a and 2b, stratified by gender.Assessments To ensure blinding, all assessments were performed in all groups at all time-points. Twelve-lead ECGs were recorded using the Mortara Instrument (Milwaukee, WI, USA) H12+ (1000 Hz) continuous 12-lead ECG digital recorder and saved onto a flash card. ECGs were read centrally by an independent assessor, blinded to the type of treatment and the date and time of recording. Standard 12-lead ECGs were extracted in triplicate for each time point from the 12-lead Holter data recordings on day −1 (baseline, time-matched to ECGs on assessment days), days 5 and 13 (for prucalopride effect) at pre dose and 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 23.5 h post dose, on day 13 at 36 and 48 h post dose and on days 1 and 15 (for assay sensitivity) at pre-dose, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h post dose. ECG intervals were measured digitally on a computer screen by trained cardiovascular technicians who were blinded to subject and treatment group using a proprietary validated electronic calliper system (WebHeart™). For each 12-lead ECG, three consecutive magnified PQRST complexes and their preceding RR intervals were manually measured. Measurements were performed from V3 (preferred) or lead II (back up), with the same lead used for each subject wherever possible. Cardiologists, each of whom read all of the ECGs for a given subject, verified the interval durations and performed the morphological analysis and diagnostic interpretation. To assess plasma concentrations of prucalopride, blood samples (4 ml) were taken on days 5 and 13 at the same time point as the ECGs. A validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method was used with a lowest and highest limit of quantification of 0.2 and 100 ng ml−1, respectively. Accuracy ranged from 98.5 to 101.3% and the coefficient of variation ranged from 0.4 to 5.6%. Safety assessments included physical examinations, vital signs, resting 12-lead ECGs, 24 h Holter monitoring, safety clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry, haematology and urinalysis) and adverse event (AE) monitoring.Statistical methods The primary endpoint was defined as the QTcSS time-matched change from baseline, where QTcSS = QT/RRλ, and the exponent λ was derived as the median value (within genders) of the regression coefficient of loge(QT) on loge(RR) using baseline data. The regression coefficients were estimated separately for each volunteer, and the median values were determined for males and females separately. Other corrections calculated were QTcF and QTcB using the Fridericia [19] and Bazett [20] corrections, respectively (data not reported here). Analysis of covariance (ancova) was performed on the time-matched change from baseline in QTcSS, separately at each time point (mean of triplicate ECGs), with treatment (active and placebo) and gender as categorical variables and (time-matched) baseline QTcSS as a linear covariate. Groups 2a and 2b were pooled for this analysis. Absence of effects of prucalopride on cardiac repolarization (i.e. non-inferiority vs. placebo) was concluded if the upper limit of the 90% two-sided Cl for the difference of prucalopride from placebo for all time points was below the non-inferiority margin of 10 ms. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9 or later. In addition, a comparison between moxifloxacin (400 mg) and placebo, to demonstrate assay sensitivity, was performed in groups 2a and 2b, regarded as an AB/BA crossover design. The ancova model included treatment, period, sequence and subject. A two-sided 90% CI was derived for the QTcSS difference (moxifloxacin minus placebo) at all time points. Assay sensitivity was considered demonstrated if the lower limit of the CI for the QTcSS difference between moxifloxacin and placebo was ≥5 ms. The sample size of 120 volunteers was based on a between and within subject standard deviation (SD) for the (baseline adjusted) gender dependent, study specific corrected QT interval (QTcSS) of 11 ms (unpublished data). For prucalopride, it was assumed that the true QTcSS effect relative to placebo was 3 ms. The moxifloxacin effect was expected to be at least 12 ms at its highest point [21].ResultsSubject disposition and demographics A total of 352 volunteers were screened, and 120 of these were enrolled and randomized to either prucalopride (group 1, n = 60), moxifloxacin/placebo (Group 2a, n = 30) or placebo/moxifloxacin (group 2b, n = 30). There were four withdrawals from the study (all female): one from the prucalopride group (day 10, due to vomiting and nausea), and three from the moxifloxacin/placebo group (one on day 11 due to personal reasons, one on day 7 due to an AE [palpable lymph node] and one on day 10 due to a protocol deviation). All other subjects completed the study. The data from all randomized subjects were included in the analysis. The majority of volunteers in the three treatment groups were Caucasian (group 1: 76.7%, group 2a: 66.7% and group 2b: 70.0%) and male (56.7% in all groups), with a BMI (mean ± SD) of 23.6 ± 2.6, 24.6 ± 3.0 and 23.9 ± 2.4 kg m−2 for group 1, 2a and 2b, respectively. Mean age (27.7–29.9 years), height (171.8–174.4 cm) and weight (70.5–73.0 kg) were comparable for all treatment groups.Change in QTcSS from baseline In order to derive the male and female study specific correction factor (λ), the relationship between QT and RR was assessed for each subject. The median values of the slopes of the regression analysis of log (QT) and log (RR) were 0.296 for men and 0.357 for women, both of which were close in value to the Fridericia correction factor (0.333). The QTcF values were therefore very similar to the QTcSS values and for that reason are not further discussed. The mean changes in QTcSS for both 2 and 10 mg prucalopride were similar to placebo over the 24 h and 48 h period, respectively. The estimated mean difference in QTcSS time-matched change from baseline between both 2 mg prucalopride and placebo as well as between 10 mg prucalopride and placebo was <5 ms at all time points studied on day 5 and day 13, respectively. These ranged from 0.89 ms (90% CI −3.43, 5.21 ms) at 12 h post dose to 3.83 ms (90% CI −0.28, 7.94 ms) at 3.5 h post dose for 2 mg prucalopride. For 10 mg prucalopride, they ranged from −0.75 ms (90% CI −4.11, 2.60 ms) at 12 h post dose to 3.03 ms (90% CI −0.33, 6.38 ms) at 2.5 h post dose. All lower limits were below zero and each corresponding upper limit of the two-sided 90% CI was below the 10 ms non-inferiority margin (Figure 1).Figure 1 Mean QTcSS differences (ms) in time-matched change from baseline between A) prucalopride (2 mg) and placebo, and B) prucalopride (10 mg) and placebo, by time point. Error bars represent 90% CIs. The solid line indicates the usual 10 ms regulatory thresholdMoxifloxacin vs. placebo (assay sensitivity) At all individual time points, except at 1 h post dose, the lower limit of the 90% CI of the difference in QTcSS time-matched change from baseline between moxifloxacin and placebo was >5 ms. Mean QTcSS changes from baseline for moxifloxacin increased up to +12.7 ms (5 h post dose), while the mean QTcSS change from baseline for placebo fluctuated post dose between −0.7 ms and +0.8 ms. This confirms that the assay was sufficiently sensitive to detect a QTc prolongation tendency associated with a single dose of moxifloxacin. The mean QTcSS during treatment with moxifloxacin was overall somewhat higher in group 2a (day 1) compared with group 2b (day 15). A difference between the groups was already observed pretreatment. Differences were considered not clinically relevant.Heart rate, PR and QRS Differences in time-matched changes in HR from baseline between 2 mg prucalopride (day 5) and placebo were positive at all time points studied and were of the same order at the supratherapeutic dose of 10 mg (day 13). Changes were mostly statistically significant, of the order of 2–5 beats min−1, but did not exceed 6 beats min−1 following either 2 mg prucalopride (4.71 beats min−1, 90% CI 2.18, 7.24 beats min−1, 12 h post dose), or 10 mg prucalopride (5.80 beats min−1, 90% CI 3.54, 8.06 beats min−1, 3.5 h post dose). Consistent with the change in HR, non-clinically relevant decreases in mean PR interval were observed: 2 mg range −3.8 ms (5 h) to −10.7 (2 h) ms, and 10 mg range −2.2 ms (36 h) to −10.1 (2 h) ms. Despite an increase in dose, the mean differences remained of the same order. Mean changes from baseline in QRS for 2 mg prucalopride ranged from −0.3 ms (24 h) to 1.8 ms (0 h), and for 10 mg prucalopride from −0.4 ms (24 h) to 1.4 ms (5 h and 36 h).Outlier analysis There were no outlying QTcSS values >450 ms at any time point following either 2 mg or 10 mg prucalopride. The number of occurrences of QTcSS increases of 30–60 ms from baseline was low in the prucalopride treated subjects: seven for 2 mg prucalopride (five for placebo) (day 5), 12 for 10 mg prucalopride (eight for placebo) (day 13), while those for moxifloxacin were 21 (five for placebo). There were only isolated occurrences of an increase >60 ms and the number did not exceed two in any group.ECG morphology analysis No ventricular arrhythmias were observed and no ECG abnormalities were considered to be of clinical significance or recorded as an AE. There were no significant differences between prucalopride and placebo in ECG morphology changes or arrhythmia.Pharmacokinetics of prucalopride Following a dose of 2 mg daily, prucalopride was rapidly absorbed, reaching a mean Cmax of 7.37 ng ml−1 at a median time of 2 h post dose on day 5 (at steady state). At the 10 mg dose, Cmax reached a mean of 42.7 ng ml−1 2 h post dose on day 13, a 5.8-fold increase in exposure for a 5-fold increase in dose. AUC over the dosing interval increased from 108 ng ml−1 h following daily dosing with 2 mg to 590 ng ml−1 h following 10 mg daily dosing, a 5.5-fold increase.Safety Overall, 105 (88%) volunteers in groups 1, 2a and 2b reported a total of 450 treatment-emergent AEs. These were more common on the first day of treatment with prucalopride (2 mg). The incidence of diarrhoea, headache and nausea was 57%, 80% and 22%, respectively, on prucalopride vs. 2%, 7% and 2%, respectively, with placebo. From day 2 to 5, there were considerably fewer reports of diarrhoea (15%), headache (10%) and nausea (7%) with prucalopride treatment. The corresponding incidences for placebo were 10%, 7% and 0%, respectively. Most AEs were mild or moderate and related to study medication. There were no severe AEs. Only one serious AE (spontaneous abortion during placebo treatment) and two AEs leading to withdrawal (see earlier section in Results). There was no observable dose-related trend in treatment-emergent AEs in the prucalopride group. There were no observable dose-related trends, clinically relevant changes or notable differences in treatment groups in any vital signs parameters, ECG safety parameters or laboratory safety parameters.Discussion This thorough QT study, which was performed in compliance with the ICH E14 Guidance on Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation, and which met the requirements for assay sensitivity, confirmed that prucalopride at both therapeutic (2 mg) [4–6] and supratherapeutic doses (10 mg) had no detectable effect on cardiac repolarization. A randomized, two-arm parallel-group design was chosen because of the need to titrate the doses up to a supratherapeutic level for tolerability reasons. The design chosen for this study is novel, reducing the number of subjects required to exclude a repolarization effect, by combining the two active groups (therapeutic and supratherapeutic) and by nesting the positive control treatment within the placebo arm of the study, resulting in effectively two study groups, active and control. This is possible because the positive control (moxifloxacin) has a relatively short half-life (compared with prucalopride), and provided that there is a sufficient period of washout between positive control and placebo observations (1–2 days), the comparisons with prucalopride are not compromised. By subdividing the placebo group, the design is arranged such that one subgroup receives the positive control at the beginning of the study (group 2a) and the other receives it at the end (group 2b, 2 days after the final supratherapeutic day for prucalopride). Thus, an AB/BA crossover design (positive control vs. placebo) can be used, which gives the advantage that any time or environmental related changes in the QTc interval which take place during the study can be isolated (and eliminated) in the positive control analysis. Although the design proved efficient in this study, extra care was required with the study blinding. In particular, to maintain blinding, dummy ECGs were collected for the prucalopride group on days where ECG measurements were required to assess the positive control in the placebo groups. Although, in general, assay sensitivity can be achieved with open label moxifloxacin [18], in a study with a nested crossover design blinding of the active control is required, as open-label moxifloxacin would effectively unblind the placebo group. The use of universal QT correction methods, such as Bazett's (QTcB) and Fridericia's (QTcF), has been questioned as these may introduce errors in estimating drug-induced QT prolongation, secondary to changes in heart rate [22]. The use of customized QT correction methods, such as the individual QT correction (QTcI), based on individual regression models computed from a set of QT/RR measurements collected during drug free periods, has been promoted as the best alternative to the universal correction methods [23]. However, based on practical and theoretical considerations, a large number of drug free ECGs are required to ensure reliable calculations of QTcl [24]. Alternatively, population specific or study specific QT correction methods (QTcSS) have been suggested, which utilize the mean or median of all individual QT/RR slopes to generate a common slope for all study participants [25]. However such an approach introduces a possible bias due to gender differences if the allocation of males and females to the groups is imbalanced. In this study, this was avoided by the use of separate medians for males and females. Furthermore, when QTcl is derived from a limited number of ECG data points it shows marginally increased variance (and hence lower power) compared with QTcSS. Given the limited number of drug free ECGs available for the derivation of a customized QT correction, we preferred to avoid the QTcI method in this study for the reasons discussed above. The study specific correction yielded gender specific exponents of 0.296 and 0.357, respectively. Consequently, for this study, the QTcSS results were similar to the QTcF results. For both therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses, the upper limit of the two-sided 90% CI for the difference in time-matched QTcSS change from baseline between prucalopride and placebo was below the non-inferiority margin of 10 ms at all time points. In addition, no subject (male or female) had a QTcSS increase greater than 60 ms, resulting in QTcSS greater than 500 ms (the threshold of clinical and regulatory concern) with either dose of prucalopride. There were also no significant differences between prucalopride and placebo in ECG morphology changes or arrhythmias, and no clinically relevant abnormalities were observed. Importantly, this study confirmed the expected QTc effect associated with the positive control moxifloxacin. During the first 6 h after administration, the moxifloxacin baseline and placebo adjusted QTcSS mean effect and lower 90% CI limit were above the 5 ms regulatory threshold at all time points, except at 1 h post dose for the lower 90% CI. For this analysis, the QTcSS values of the parallel groups 2a and 2b were combined. It is therefore of interest to compare the QTcSS values of groups 2a (day 1) and 2b (day 15). The values were similar although the mean values for group 2a were somewhat lower than for group 2b. However the differences remained well within the standard deviation. Also on non-treatment days the QTcSS values were around 5 ms lower for group 2a, except at 1 h where they were 1–2 ms higher. These findings reinforce confidence in the validity of the results obtained with prucalopride. Both doses of prucalopride were associated with a small and, in most cases, statistically significant increase in HR, which is not considered to be clinically relevant. A small, transient increase in HR with prucalopride treatment has also been observed in animals. An extended series of safety pharmacology studies with special emphasis on cardiovascular parameters showed no relevant changes in haemodynamic or ECG-derived parameters (QTc), with the exception of a modest increase in heart rate and blood pressure in conscious dogs after bolus intravenous administration, which was not observed either in anaesthetized dogs or after oral administration in dogs reaching similar plasma concentrations [26]. Consistent with the change in HR, non-clinically relevant decreases in mean PR interval were observed, which were similar for 2 and 10 mg prucalopride. QRS interval showed the same pattern. The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride are linear and the supratherapeutic dose of 10 mg represents a 5-fold increase in exposure of that of the therapeutic dose of 2 mg. Metabolism is not a major route of elimination of prucalopride and a large fraction of the drug is excreted unchanged. Prucalopride has a low potential for drug–drug interactions. It is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, nor are these drugs expected to affect the disposition of prucalopride. Although prucalopride may be a weak substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), it is not an inhibitor of P-gp at clinically relevant concentrations. No effect on the plasma concentrations of prucalopride was observed with erythromycin, paroxetine, cimetidine and probenecid [26]. Ketoconazole, at a high dose of 200 mg twice daily, increased the area under the curve of prucalopride by approximately 40% [26] which is likely attributable to inhibition of P-gp mediated renal transport. Prucalopride may also be secreted via other renal transporters and inhibition of all transporters involved in the active secretion of prucalopride may theoretically increase its exposure by up to 75%. Assuming this worst case scenario, the supra-therapeutic dose of 10 mg still yields an almost 3-fold increase of this exposure. Therefore the choice of 10 mg once daily as the supratherapeutic dose for this study appears appropriate. Treatment with prucalopride at doses up to 10 mg once daily was safe and well tolerated from day 2 onwards. The high incidence of gastrointestinal-related treatment-emergent AEs in the prucalopride group is due to the pharmacodynamic action of the drug and is more often seen on days 1–2 of treatment, consistent with findings previously reported [4–6]. In conclusion, this thorough QT study, conducted in accordance with the ICH E14 Guidance on Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation, found no evidence of QT prolongation or pro-arrhythmic potential for prucalopride in healthy volunteers, at doses up to five times the recommended therapeutic dose. At both therapeutic (2 mg) and supratherapeutic (10 mg) doses, the upper CI for the time-matched changes from baseline QTcSS values were below the 10 ms regulatory threshold at all time points, confirming the absence of any clinically relevant effect of prucalopride on cardiac repolarization. The results with the positive control, moxifloxacin, demonstrated that this study was sufficiently sensitive to detect a QT prolongation of the magnitude of regulatory and clinical concern. At doses of 2 mg and 10 mg prucalopride, a small and clinically irrelevant increase in HR was observed, but there were no significant differences between prucalopride and placebo in ECG morphological changes or arrhythmias.

The measurement of HbA1c has reached a high level of analytical quality and, therefore, this biomarker is currently also suggested to be used for the diagnosis of diabetes. Nevertheless, it is crucial for people with diabetes and their treating physicians to be aware of possible interferences during its measurement as well as physiological or pathological factors that contribute to the HbA1c concentration without being related to glycemia, which are discussed in this review. We performed a comprehensive review of the literature based on PubMed searches on HbA1c in the treatment and diagnosis of diabetes including its most relevant limitations, glycemic variability and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Although the high analytical quality of the HbA1c test is widely acknowledged, the clinical relevance of this marker regarding risk reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is still under debate. In this respect, we argue that glycemic variability as a further risk factor should deserve more attention in the treatment of diabetes.	Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is currently the most commonly used marker for the determination of the glycemic status in people with diabetes and it is frequently used to guide therapy and especially medical treatment of people with diabetes.

We performed a comprehensive review of the literature based on PubMed searches on HbA1c in the treatment and diagnosis of diabetes including its most relevant limitations, glycemic variability and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Although the high analytical quality of the HbA1c test is widely acknowledged, the clinical relevance of this marker regarding risk reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is still under debate. In this respect, we argue that glycemic variability as a further risk factor should deserve more attention in the treatment of diabetes. Why and how do we measure HbA1c? Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, or A1c) is currently the most prominent biomarker for assessing the glycemic status of people with diabetes and for making decisions on the appropriate therapy adjustments, if needed. Discovered more than forty years ago by Samuel Rahbar 1 and co-workers, the breakthrough for HbA1c was achieved when it was discovered in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in 1993 that the concentration of HbA1c was an excellent predictor of diabetes-related long-term complications 2. Over the years, many healthcare providers have come to view the HbA1c value as a "magic number" that comprises all of the information required for managing blood glucose concentrations to prevent complications in people with diabetes; the concept "the lower the better" was considered a tempting approach. With this review article we do not intend to question the value of HbA1c measurements; rather it is to discuss some limitations of this biomarker that healthcare providers should be aware of. These limitations are related to the analytical measurement of HbA1c and to a variety of physiological and pathological conditions influencing the HbA1c concentration. Glucose exists predominantly in a cyclic form; however, this form is in chemical equilibrium with a small fraction of acyclic glucose which exhibits a very chemically active aldehyde group that is able to react in a non-enzymatic manner with amino groups of the side chains of proteins. The reaction takes place in two steps (Fig. 1): In the first, reversible step, glucose forms an aldimine (Schiff base) with an amino group in the protein. In the second, irreversible step, the aldimine becomes a ketoamine which persists for the remaining lifetime of the protein. This chemical reaction is termed glycation. In principal, all amino groups of the side chains of proteins can become glycated; however, a couple of factors have an important impact on the concentrations of the final glycation end products: (a) the concentration of the protein, (b) the steric accessibility of the different side chain amino groups, (c) the glucose concentration in the compartment of the reaction, and (d) the lifespan of the glycated protein. Hemoglobin makes up most of the content of red blood cells, which are continuously exposed to glucose in the blood. Therefore, hemoglobin is also continuously becoming glycated. What Samuel Rahbar and co-workers had seen was a thin extra band on electrophoresis gels, representing glycated hemoglobin. Initially, HbA1c was just the name given to a band in hemoglobin electrophoresis, and only later it was found that it consists of a mixture of hemoglobin molecules that are glycated at different side chain amino positions. Assuming that the reaction rate is proportional to the hemoglobin concentration and that the accessibility of the side chain amino groups of hemoglobin for glucose and the lifetime of the red blood cells are constant, only the glucose concentration should have an influence on the concentration of HbA1c in terms of percentage. Accordingly, HbA1c would be the perfect proxy for the blood glucose concentration over the average lifespan of red blood cells. However, we now know that this model is an oversimplified description. As the quantification of the small HbA1c peak in comparison to the large HbA0 peak is difficult to perform in gel electrophoresis, more advanced technologies have been developed. Today, most HbA1c measurements are performed using either ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in which HbA1c is separated from HbA0 due to its different electric charge, by boronate affinity column methods where the glycosylated hemoglobins are bound by immobilized boronic acid to separate them from non-glycosylated hemoglobins, or by immunoassays using antibodies against glycated hemoglobin and turbidimetry, for example, as the detection principle. It is important to note that certain routine laboratory methods may give inaccurate results in the presence of pathological hemoglobins such as HbC, HbS, HbE or HbD (see below). When HbA1c became a global standard for determining glycemic status after the DCCT was published, it became apparent from external quality assessment schemes that HbA1c concentrations determined from identical blood samples in external quality assessment schemes showed (sometimes striking) differences in different laboratories, thus limiting the diagnostic value of HbA1c determination. To overcome this obstacle, two different approaches were adopted (historical reviews 3,4). In 1996, the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) 5,6 was launched in the USA. The NGSP consists of primary and secondary reference laboratories running a special HPLC method as the designated comparison method. Manufacturers and clinical laboratories that intend to reach NGSP certification must fulfill certain precision requirements and must recover samples within pre-defined limits in method comparisons of sample panels distributed by NGSP reference laboratories. The allowed deviations have become smaller over the years. In 1994, the International Federation for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) adopted an entirely different approach 7. Because HbA1c is a combination of hemoglobins glycated at different side chain amino groups, which makes it difficult to standardize the analyte, an IFCC working group redefined HbA1c in the following way: HbA1c is HbA0 glycated at the N-terminal amino group of the β chain (βN-1-deoxyfructosyl-hemoglobin). The advantage of this definition is that HbA1c is now no longer considered a mixture but a clearly identified chemical substance, comprising more than 60% of the amount of substance that has previously been termed HbA1c. The disadvantage is that the numerical value of the concentration has changed and is, therefore, not comparable to what it had been before and that the concentrations measured by a newly developed reference procedure (see next paragraph) are no longer comparable to those obtained during the DCCT. However, this issue has been addressed and solved. Once the analyte HbA1c had been redefined, another working group within the IFCC developed a reference system for HbA1c, comprising: (a) a primary reference material 8, (b) a reference method ("reference procedure") 9, and (c) a network of reference laboratories 10. In short, the reference procedure is based on the specific enzymatic cleavage of the glycated and non-glycated hemoglobin, resulting in both a glycated and a non-glycated β-N-terminal hexapeptide. These hexapeptides are first separated from the remaining peptides in the sample by reversed phase HPLC and then quantified during either capillary electrophoresis or electron spray ionization mass spectrometry. Only few laboratories, globally, are capable of performing this reference procedure. In a consensus statement 11, the IFCC, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD), the American Diabetes Association (ADA), and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) stated that this reference procedure is the "metrological anchor" for HbA1c measurement, and that measurement results shall be expressed in mmol/mol and in addition in percent. In order to avoid a change of the numerical values, the HbA1c percent values are now recalculated to match former “DCCT values” using the equation HbA1c (%) = [0.915*IFCC reference method value (%)] + 2.15 so that the change in standardization does not change the numeric HbA1c concentrations that patients and healthcare providers are already familiar with. As the IFCC reference procedure has now been accepted as the metrological anchor for the different national HbA1c standardization schemes, including NGSP, HbA1c is now recognized as a protein with a very high level of standardization compared to other proteins used in clinical laboratory medicine. The result of this standardization can be seen immediately when recent results of external quality assessment schemes are compared to earlier ones (e.g., as seen in laboratory performance data from surveys of the College of American Pathologists [CAP] 12 from 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2010) (Fig. 2). The inter- laboratory standard deviation has significantly improved. The quality of HbA1c measurement is generally considered satisfying, except for some point-of-care methods in the market 13. This was one of the prerequisites for the suggestion to use HbA1c not only as marker for monitoring the metabolic status of people with diabetes but also for the diagnosis of diabetes.Can HbA1c be used for diagnosing diabetes? The National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) provided consensus diagnostic criteria for diabetes in 1979 that were based on distributions of glucose levels, rather than on the relationship of glucose levels with complications. The diagnostic cut-off values chosen were based on the relative risk of decompensation to overt or symptomatic diabetes. These criteria comprised a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) or greater and a 2-h plasma glucose (PG) concentration during a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or greater 14. Later, in 1997, the Expert Committee on Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus reviewed existing population data for retinopathy in three different populations - Egyptians, Pima Indians and the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) population - and determined that the relatively diabetes-specific comorbidity retinopathy was not detected at lower levels of FPG, 2-h PG, and HbA1c concentrations; above certain thresholds, retinopathy prevalence increased progressively. Accordingly, the group recommended an FPG of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) and confirmed the existing 2-h PG threshold of 200 mg/dL to be adequate cut-off values for the diagnosis of diabetes 15. In the following decade, those threshold concentrations became worldwide standards for the diagnosis of diabetes. The use of HbA1c was not recommended for the diagnosis of diabetes due to a lack of worldwide standardization of the laboratory assay and absence of consensus on the appropriate diagnostic cut-off value. More than a decade later, in 2009, the International Expert Committee with members appointed by the ADA, the EASD, and the IDF convened and recommended an HbA1c cut-off value of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) for the diagnosis of diabetes 16. This decision was based on an analysis of the DETECT-2 Study, a database analysis of 13 studies examining the association of retinopathy with measures of glycemia, assessed and graded by fundus photography and comprising data from 28,898 persons aged 20 to 79 16. In its 2010 Clinical Practice Recommendations, the ADA included an HbA1c of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) or greater as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. In addition to the availability of comprehensive population data on retinopathy prevalence in association with HbA1c concentrations, these recommendations were enabled due to significant proceedings in the attempt to establish worldwide standardization of the HbA1c assay. Furthermore, with advances in instrumentation as well as accuracy and precision, the performance of the current state of the art HbA1c assays match those of glucose assays. In addition, HbA1c testing offers many advantages over FPG or 2-h PG tests for the diagnosis of diabetes 17: Standardization and alignment with the DCCT / United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS); Better index of overall glycemic exposure; Equal or greater accuracy in predicting risk for long-term complications (retinopathy); Significantly less biologic variability; Lower level of short-term intra-individual variability 18; High pre-analytical stability (up to one week at 4°C); Ability to sample blood at any time — fasting samples are no longer required; Relatively unaffected by acute fluctuations in glucose levels (e.g., due to stress or dietary intake); Established for guiding diabetes management and decision support; Considerably quicker to obtain than OGTT results. There is broad consensus on the advantages of a standardized HbA1c assay over FPG and 2-h PG testing, however, the most appropriate cut-off value for the diagnosis of diabetes is still subject to debate. The International Expert Committee based their decision to establish the diagnostic cut-off value as 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) on an analysis of the DETECT-2 Study 16 and on three population analyses that were included in the 1997 report. When the data for moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) were examined in 0.5% increments, the glycemic level at which the prevalence began to rise above background levels turned out to be 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) 17. Moderate retinopathy was practically nonexistent in more than 20,000 subjects with HbA1c concentrations <6.5%. Conclusively, the optimal cut-off value for detecting at least moderate retinopathy was an HbA1c of 6.5%. According to the International Expert Committee, this threshold provides a fair balance for the potential stigma and costs of mistakenly identifying individuals as people with diabetes and the clinical consequences of delaying the diagnosis in someone with an HbA1c concentration <6.5% (48 mmol/mol). There is no doubt that HbA1c concentrations between subjects with normal OGTT and those with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) show some overlap, as demonstrated by Fajans et al. 19. According to their data analysis, HbA1c may be in the normal range in subjects with diabetes mellitus or IGT and among subjects with mild fasting hyperglycemia. Therefore, they claim that HbA1c alone is not a sufficiently reliable tool for recognizing particularly the early stages of diabetes or IGT and recommend that plasma glucose determinations (FPG, 2-h PG, or OGTT) should be used if a history or symptoms indicate a high risk for the presence of diabetes and HbA1c is <6.5% (48 mmol/mol). Other studies examining the utility of the HbA1c assay within different ethnic groups, including Chinese, Arabs, and non-Hispanic white and black Americans, suggest that a universal diagnostic cut-off value of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) may not be appropriate to identify all people at risk of developing retinopathy who should, therefore, be diagnosed as having diabetes 19-21. Based on the NHANES-3 data from 2005 to 2006, it was estimated that 5.9 million non-Hispanic U.S. adults with unrecognized diabetes would be missed by screening with the HbA1c method and the proposed diagnostic cut-off values only 21. Conclusively, it should be pointed out that HbA1c is a relatively weak surrogate marker for glucose but rather serves as an alternative marker for microvascular risk 22. In our view, this is supported by the findings of the A1c-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) Study Group. When describing the concept of 'Translating the A1c Assay Into Estimated Average Glucose Values' 23, it became apparent that although 90% of HbA1c concentrations predicted the average measured glucose within ± 15.0%, significant deviations were observed (Fig. 3). Since the average glucose concentration had been determined very carefully in this study, these deviations are hard to explain by measurement error only. As a consequence, HbA1c detects different populations at risk, which is not essentially a concern, given that it predicts risk equally well. However, due to ethnic differences in the relationship between HbA1c and mean blood glucose 24, a universally defined threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes will remain subject of debate.Which factors other than glycemia can affect HbA1c concentrations? In people with diabetes with an HbA1c >7.0% (53 mmol/mol) on oral anti- diabetic therapy, basal hyperglycemia contributes most to HbA1c; after addition of basal insulins, basal hyperglycemia still contributes one third to HbA1c 25. However, despite all progress in analytical standardization of HbA1c, the limitation still remains that the concentration of HbA1c is affected by other factors than glucose. Before glycation of hemoglobin can take place, glucose has to move across the cell membrane into the interior of the red blood cells. This is a fast process mediated by the passive glucose transporter GLUT1 26. However, people with identical blood glucose concentrations may have different glucose concentrations in their red blood cells 27. If the kinetic characteristics of glucose transport across the red blood cell were equal for all individuals, the ratio between the concentrations of (intracellular) HbA1c and (extracellular) glycated serum albumin (also termed fructosamine) should be an intra- and inter-individual constant. It has, however, been shown that this ratio remains constant for individuals only but not for populations; an observation that has also been called the 'glycation gap' 28. This factor may, among others, also explain the differences that have been observed in the distribution of HbA1c concentrations in non-diabetic non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black and Mexican Americans in the NHANES-3, that cannot be explained by other confounding factors (Fig. 4) 29,30. Finally, twin studies have contributed to our understanding that there is an inherited component contributing to individual HbA1c concentrations. The correlation of HbA1c concentrations in non-diabetic monozygotic twins was higher than in non-diabetic dizygotic twins (r = 0.77 vs. r = 0.53), and HbA1c was not only correlated in monozygotic twins concordant for type 1 diabetes (T1DM) (r = 0.68) but, to a smaller degree, also in monozygotic twins discordant for T1DM (r = 0.52) 31. The authors concluded that genetic effects (heritability) account for 62% of the variance of HbA1c in the study population; the rest is attributable to environment and age. Surprisingly, HbA1c heritability could not be attributed to genes related to fasting glucose. As red blood cells typically have a lifespan of about 120 days, HbA1c should represent glycemia over this period of time. Obviously, all conditions that shorten the lifespan of red blood cells will decrease HbA1c as the average time during which red blood cells are exposed to glucose is reduced. Such conditions comprise, for example, hypersplenism and all types of hemolytic anemias which may be acquired (e.g., during infections such as malaria, in hemolytic microangiopathies, in drug- induced or in auto-immune hemolytic anemia), or that are inborn (e.g., variants of the hemoglobin genotype in hemoglobinopathies, disturbed hemoglobin synthesis in thalassemias, or increased red blood cell fragility in elliptocytosis and spherocytosis). There are indications that hyperglycemia itself may also reduce red blood cell lifespan 32. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 5.2% of the world population carries a significant hemoglobin variant 33. The hemoglobin variants comprise a variety of congenital disorders of one or more of the four globin chains of hemoglobin. In general, hemoglobinopathies are divided into two groups: thalassemia syndromes and abnormal hemoglobins. Both are caused by mutations and/or deletions in the α- or β-globin genes, leading to a reduced rate of synthesis or no synthesis of one of the globin chains and/or differences in the amino acid composition, while the hem group remains unchanged. When gene defects cause hemoglobin synthesis disorders, this gives rise to thalassemias. The hemoglobin structure in these cases is normal 34. When mutations cause changes in the hemoglobin structure, this gives rise to abnormal hemoglobins. The term 'thalassemia' describes a cluster of hemoglobin synthesis disorders, which are autosomal recessive conditions. The nomenclature is led by the location of the defect. α- and β-thalassemias have the greatest clinical significance. Homozygous forms of thalassemias are accompanied by serious, hypochromic hemolytic anemias and complex diseases. Heterozygous carriers usually show a mild, iron-refractory, microcytic and hypochromic anemia. α-thalassemias are caused by an α-chain synthesis defect. At the molecular level, they result from partial (α+) or total (α0) deletions, or more rarely mutations of one or more of the four α-globin genes (αα/αα). They occur mainly in Africa, Arab nations, and, more frequently, South-East Asia 34. Accordingly, β-thalassemia syndromes are the result of insufficient (β+) or absent (β0) production of β-chains caused by β-globin gene mutations. Most people with β-thalassemia syndromes come from Mediterranean countries, South-East Europe, Arab nations, and Asia 34. With respect to HbA1c determination, two confounding effects of thalassemias should be considered: the alteration of the hemoglobin molecule as analytical target and the potential impact of anemia. The other group of hemoglobinopathies, abnormal hemoglobin variants, is autosomal dominant inherited hemoglobin disorders characterized by structural defects, resulting from an altered amino acid sequence in the α- or β-chains. While some of these hemoglobin variants are clinically harmless, others can cause illness. These latter are divided into the following four well-defined groups 35: Variants with a tendency to aggregate and with sickle cell formation (e.g., the sickle cell hemoglobin HbS 36; Variants with abnormal hemoglobin synthesis (e.g., HbE) 37; Variants with a tendency to precipitate and with hemolysis (e.g., Hb Köln) 38; Variants with abnormal oxygen transport and congenital polycythemia (e.g., Hb Johnstown) 39. Variants of the third and fourth group cause serious illness when heterozygous, and can be fatal when in homozygous form. Correct interpretation of HbA1c measurements depends on normal erythrocyte lifespan. In individuals with sickle cell, HbC, or HbD disease it is, therefore, recommended to use other tests than HbA1c for the determination of glycemic control, such as glycated serum albumin. As heterozygous carriers show normal erythrocyte survival, HbA1c can be used as long as the hemoglobin variant neither interferes with the assay method itself, nor with glucose binding to hemoglobin. In addition, the presence of some variants can modify the net charge of the hemoglobin and/or the recognition of the glycated N-terminus by antibodies, resulting in inaccurate HbA1c concentrations for some methods. Therefore, the effect of each variant must be specifically examined with each HbA1c method. On its website, the NGSP provides a comprehensive overview of interferences for most of the commonly used HbA1c methods for the most common hemoglobin variants and derivatives 40. With respect to interference of the most common hemoglobin variants with HbA1c determination, four different methods should be considered: 1. HbA1c-specific immunoassays: Antibodies commonly recognize a structure of 4 to 10 amino acids at the N-terminus of the β-chain including the glycated N- terminal valine. Some, but not all, of these methods are affected by the presence of HbS and HbC variants, as the underlying mutations of the β-chain are close to the N- terminus 50. In contrast, the presence of HbE or HbD with mutations much further away on the β-chain usually does not affect antibody-based methods 41. 2. Ion-exchange HPLC: Separation of hemoglobin molecules is based on charge differences between HbA1c and other hemoglobins. As the amino acid modifications in hemoglobin variants S, C, D, and E cause a change in the net charge of the hemoglobin molecule, these methods may cause interference 41,42. In some cases the hemoglobin variant may coelute with HbA1c. Fortunately, interferences from hemoglobin variants using ion-exchange HPLC methods can often be detected in the chromatograms (Fig. 5). 3. Boronate affinity methods: m-aminophenylboronic acid reacts specifically with the cis-diol groups of glucose bound to hemoglobin. Hence, boronate affinity measures the ratio of total glycated to non-glycated hemoglobin regardless of hemoglobin species. Therefore, this method tends to show the least interference from the presence of hemoglobin variants 41,42. However, interference from elevated concentrations of HbF has been observed and is thought to be a consequence of a lower glycation rate for HbF compared with HbA. As a consequence, the presence of elevated HbF indicates a falsely too low HbA1c concentration 42. 4. Direct enzymatic method: This assay measures HbA1c by using an enzyme that specifically cleaves the N-terminal valine. Currently, there is only one assay available (Direct Enzymatic HbA1c Assay™, Diazyme Laboratories, Poway, CA, U.S.). No interferences due to the presence of HbS, C, D, E or elevated concentrations of HbF have been reported. Regardless of the method used, any condition that shortens red blood cell survival or decreases mean erythrocyte age will falsely lower HbA1c. HbA1c results from people with diabetes with HbSS, HbCC, and HbSC must be interpreted with caution given the pathological processes, including anemia, increased red cell turnover, and transfusion requirements that adversely impact HbA1c as a marker of long-term glycemic control. For these people with diabetes, alternative forms of testing, such as glycated serum albumin, should be considered. Glycated serum albumin indicates average glucose levels over a much shorter period of time than the HbA1c test, usually about two or three weeks. However, the glycated serum albumin test is not standardized and the relationship of results of this test to glucose levels or risk for complications has not been established 43. There are other factors in addition to the above-mentioned ones that have an influence on HbA1c. For reasons not yet understood, iron deficiency anemia can increase HbA1c concentrations by up to two percentage points; a process that is reversible when iron deficiency anemia is cured 44. Conversely, pregnancy leads to a reduction in HbA1c concentrations. In an Italian multicenter study, the HbA1c reference intervals were 4.0%-5.5% (20-37 mmol/mol) for pregnant non-diabetic women and 4.8%-6.2% (29-44 mmol/mol) for non-pregnant controls 45. As discussed earlier, HbA1c is an inappropriate marker for detecting rapid glucose changes and periods of acute hyper- or hypoglycemia. However, there is increasing evidence that especially these acute phases contribute to the common complications in diabetes.What are the consequences of acute hyperglycemia in critically ill patients? In patients experiencing an acute phase of critical illness such as severe brain injury 46, trauma 47,48, myocardial infarction 49 or stroke 50, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are commonly observed, even if these patients have not previously been diagnosed with diabetes 51-53. In numerous different clinical settings with critically ill patients 46-50, elevated glucose levels, even at modest degrees, have been identified as an independent risk factor for substantial increase in in-hospital morbidity 54-56 and mortality 54,55,57. In 2001, data from the landmark clinical trial conducted by Van den Berghe et al. 54 showed that tight glycemic control with intensive insulin therapy, targeting achievement, and maintenance of normoglycemia (approximately 90-99 mg/dL [5.0-5.5 mmol/L] mean blood glucose levels) significantly lowered mortality and prevented several most feared complications such as bloodstream infections, acute renal failure, bacteremia, and polyneuropathy associated with critical illness. In striking contrast to the findings by Van den Berghe et al. 54, investigators of the Normoglycaemia in Intensive Care Evaluation-Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation (NICE-SUGAR) 58 trial concluded from their results that a blood glucose target of less than 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) resulted in lower mortality than a target of 81-108 mg/dL (4.5-6.0 mmol/L). Their findings suggested that a goal of normoglycemia for glucose control is not necessarily beneficial to critically ill patients and may be harmful, thus not recommending use of the lower target in critically ill adults. Conversely, several other studies 56,59-61 evaluating tight blood glucose control in populations on medical and surgical intensive care units (ICUs) revealed comparable beneficial findings regarding both mortality and morbidity comparable to the Van den Berghe et al. 54 findings, even though the mechanisms by which the intensive insulin therapy improves outcomes are not completely elucidated. During the acute phase of physical and mental stress in critically ill patients, the endocrine stress response including elevated levels of cytokines, growth hormone, glucagon, and cortisol opposes the normal action of insulin and increases lipolysis and proteolysis, providing substrates for the hepatic gluconeogenesis. Supportingly, released catecholamines enhance hepatic glycogenolysis and inhibit glycogenesis, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels despite increased levels of released insulin 62. The increased levels of released insulin, impaired peripheral glucose uptake, and elevated hepatic glucose production reflect the development of insulin resistance 63, constituting the vicious circle of hyperglycemia that must be addressed. When treatment with insulin is initiated, it can be assumed that the insulin therapy lowers glucose levels mainly via increase of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and intracellular glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose tissue by means of up-regulation of glucose carrier and transporter density as well as intracellular enzyme activity 64. Furthermore, intensive insulin therapy prevents excessive inflammation 65,66, restores leukocyte function 67, and stimulates the anti-inflammatory cascade 68, compensating for increased risk of infection caused by hyperglycemia.Does chronic hyperglycemia in people with diabetes have the same consequences as in critically ill patients? The exposure to elevated blood glucose levels in people with diabetes involves two components: the duration and magnitude of chronically sustained hyperglycemia, reflected in HbA1c, and the acute fluctuations of glucose around a mean value from peaks to nadirs over a daily period 69-73, reflecting intermittent acute glucose toxicity, obviously illustrated by glycemic variability. As a parameter for the overall glycemic control, HbA1c thus reveals little about individual daily glucose fluctuations 74. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown a significantly more deleterious effect of oscillating glucose levels over a 24-h period to endothelial function than stable constant high glucose levels by activating oxidative stress pathways 75,76, significantly contributing to promoting lipid peroxidation and decreasing antioxidation capacity 77,78. Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium may be one of the most critical inducers of micro- and macrovascular damages in diabetes 79-81. A growing body of evidence indicates that recurrent and/or periodic blood glucose fluctuations with large amplitude levels beyond near-normoglycemic limits play a much more serious role in diabetic vascular damage than chronically sustained hyperglycemia.Is lowering of HbA1c the key to reduce cardiovascular risk? Although microvascular complications including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy can lead to significant morbidity and premature mortality, the greatest cause of death in people with diabetes is cardiovascular disease (CVD); the risk for CVD in people with diabetes is increased two- to fourfold compared to people without diabetes 82,83-85. Until recently, there has been little evidence that specifically targeting glycemic control can reduce the frequency of cardiovascular end-points 86,87. Several large epidemiological prospective trials, partly with long-term results, have been conducted to determine whether intensive glycemic control prevents microvascular complications, cardiovascular events, and mortality in people with diabetes 88. Table 1 summarizes their findings about risk reduction of CVD owing to tight glycemic control. Interestingly, a post hoc subgroup analysis of the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT) 95 suggested that people with a diabetes duration of less than 12 years appear to derive a cardiovascular benefit from intensive glycemic control. If diabetes had existed for more than 12 years at the time of study entry, however, cardiovascular event rates were either unchanged or even increased in people with diabetes treated with intensive glycemic control 95. For the prevention of microvascular and macrovascular disease in people with diabetes, the currently recommended target of HbA1c concentrations should remain less than 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) 96, particularly in young people with T1DM and in individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2DM) 93. Less stringent HbA1c goals of greater than 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) might be indicated for people with type 2 diabetes who have extensive comorbid conditions, limited life expectancy, or an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia. Considering that hypoglycemia was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in both the intensive therapy and standard treatment, substantial hypoglycemia should be avoided 82. As demonstrated in the trials Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE), and VADT, a target HbA1c concentration of ≤ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (near-normal range) was unable to show reduction of macrovascular complications in people with type 2 diabetes. In people with T1DM, a period of intensified glycemic control results in a subsequent risk reduction of any cardiovascular event, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from CVD many years after the initial intervention 86,87,93. This late cardiovascular benefit has been described as the legacy effect and is believed to confer a so-called metabolic memory or long-term cardiovascular protection 87,88,97. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for it remain unclarified. It has been postulated that people with T2DM would also realize long-term cardiovascular protection through early and intensive control of glycemia, resulting in a significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and total mortality 86. However, in people with a long history of T2DM and high cardiovascular risk, intensive glucose control reduces the rate of events in coronary heart disease and CVD but not cardiovascular or total mortality 86,90,93,97,98. As reported in the DCCT´s long-term follow-up study Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) 87 and, particularly, in the UKPDS Post-Trial Monitoring 90 data analysis, the difference in HbA1c concentrations between the intensive and conventional therapy groups was lost over time. This phenomenon was observed in the latter only one year after the UKPDS closed. As both the intensive and conventional therapy resulted in comparable HbA1c concentrations persisting over time, the observed legacy effect under intensive treatment is, therefore, highly unlikely derived only from lowered HbA1c concentrations but assumingly also from additional factors.Reduction of glycemic variability by means of SMBG - does it make the difference? In the ACCORD study, people with diabetes in the intensive-therapy group attended monthly visits for the first four months and then every two months thereafter with the aim of rapidly and safely reducing HbA1c concentrations to below 6.0% (42 mmol/mol) 99,100. The study protocol mentioned that people with diabetes not willing to do frequent capillary blood glucose self-monitoring were excluded. On the basis of the glycated hemoglobin concentration at each visit, the ADVANCE trial protocol initially advised increasing the dose with the sequential addition of oral antidiabetics or insulin with the initial use of basal insulin and addition of short-acting insulin at meals for people with diabetes in whom the target HbA1c concentration was not achieved 91. In the VADT study, insulin was added for people with diabetes in the intensive-therapy group who did not achieve an HbA1c concentration of less than 6.0% (42 mmol/mol) and for those in the standard-therapy group with a concentration of less than 9.0% (75 mmol/mol) before any change in oral medications. Subsequent changes in medication were determined according to protocol guidelines and local assessment. The goal for the HbA1c concentrations was an absolute reduction of 1.5 percentage points in the intensive-therapy group as compared with the standard-therapy group 92. None of these epidemiological trials, ACCORD, ADVANCE or VADT, integrated self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) with documented glucose levels obtained at prescribed preprandial and postprandial time points over a daily period to determine dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents in their study procedures. Use of this type of “structured” SMBG regimen would have shown blood glucose profiles over a daily period, providing fundamental information about the potential need for differentiated dosage adjustments of preprandially and/or postprandially effective hypoglycemic agents. Instead, the dosage adjustment of antidiabetic oral agents or insulins was determined by the set target HbA1c concentrations, not by the preprandial and/or postprandial blood glucose levels. In contrast to the ACCORD, ADVANCE and VADT trials, the treatment adjustment practice integrated in the DCCT, UKPDS and the most recent STeP (Structured Testing Program) study 101,102 was based on the measured glucose levels at several points of time predefined during the day. The aim of intensive treatment in the UKPDS was FPG less than 108 mg/dL (6.0 mmol/L) and, in insulin-treated people with diabetes, pre-meal glucose concentrations of 72-126 mg/dL (4.0-7.0 mmol/L). Whenever glucose concentrations were above target concentrations, a letter was sent from the coordinating center with advice on necessary changes in therapy. Insulin-treated subjects started on once daily ultralente insulin or isophane insulin. If the daily dose was >14 units (U) or pre-meal or bed-time SMBG measurements were >126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), a short-acting insulin, usually soluble regular insulin, was added, i.e., basal/bolus regimen. Subjects on more than 14 U insulin per day or on short-acting insulins were particularly encouraged to do regular SMBG 89. In the DCCT 2 with people with T1DM, intensive therapy included the administration of insulin three or more times daily by injection or an external pump. The dosage was adjusted according to the results of SMBG performed at least four times per day, dietary intake, and anticipated exercise. Blood glucose concentrations achieved with each treatment arm (intensive therapy and conventional therapy) were measured with quarterly seven-point capillary-blood glucose profiles. The mean value for all glucose profiles in the intensive therapy group was 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L), as compared with 231 mg/dL (12.8 mmol/L) in the conventional therapy group, i.e., in the intensive therapy group, seven-point capillary-blood glucose values including preprandial and postprandial glucose excursions were shifted down towards the normoglycemic range, reducing excursion amplitudes lying far beyond near-normal range. The differences between treatments were statistically significant at each of the seven testing times 2. Most recently, Polonsky et al. 101,102 published the STeP study results, assessing the effectiveness of structured blood glucose testing in poorly controlled, non-insulin-treated T2DM. People with diabetes with a duration of T2DM for more than 1 year, aged ≥ 25 years and HbA1c concentrations ≥ 7.5% (59 mmol/mol) to < 12.0% (108 mmol/mol) were included. The primary end point was a change in HbA1c from screening to 12 months in subjects using structured SMBG in conjunction with enhanced usual care (structured testing group [STG]) compared to an active control group (ACG) that received enhanced usual care only. Enhanced usual care included quarterly clinic visits that focused specifically on diabetes management, free blood glucose meters and strips, and office point-of-care HbA1c capability. STG participants used the validated Accu-Chek® 360° View 3-day profile tool 103, a validated paper tool, that enabled people with diabetes to record and plot a seven-point SMBG profile (fasting, preprandial/2-h postprandial at each meal, bedtime) on three consecutive days prior to each scheduled study visit. STG physicians/staff received training on interpreting the structured data and were provided with an algorithm that described various pharmacologic (initiation of a new medication, increase/decrease in the dose of an existing medication, and/ or termination of an existing medication) and lifestyle (defined as any change in diet, exercise, or other self-care behavior) treatment strategies that could be used in response to the specific SMBG patterns identified. Both the intent-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses revealed that both groups showed significant reductions in HbA1c concentrations. However, STG subjects in the intent-to-treat group evidenced significantly greater mean reductions in HbA1c than ACG subjects over the 12 months (-1.2% vs. -0.9%). Per protocol analysis revealed an even greater mean HbA1c reduction among those STG subjects who adhered to the intervention compared with ACG subjects (-1.3% vs. -0.8%) 102. Early treatment modification recommendations (TMRs) were associated with significantly greater glycemic improvement than later treatment modification recommendations, especially in people with diabetes with the poorest glycemic control at baseline (HbA1c ≥ 8.5% [70 mmol/mol]) 104. Furthermore, STG subjects showed significantly lower average preprandial and postprandial glucose levels at all meals and at bedtime from month 1 to month 12 in all cases. More importantly, there was a significant drop from month 1 to month 12 in preprandial to postprandial glucose excursions at all meals (Fig. 6) 105. Measurements of mean amplitude of glucose excursions indicated significant mean reductions in glycemic variability among STG subjects from 38.5 mg/dL at month 1 to 34.3 mg/dL at month 12 102, thus shifted down towards near-normoglycemic range. In contrast to conflicting data about effectiveness of SMBG from other trials 106-114, the STeP study results were able to demonstrate that using pattern recognition of blood glucose levels by means of SMBG profiles and subsequent early treatment modifications by involving physicians or other healthcare professionals lead to significant reduction of HbA1c, and simultaneously, of glycemic variability in the study participants. Although long-term outcome data are unavailable in the STeP study due to the lack of time potentially showing the legacy effect in the study subjects, the results in the DCCT´s long-term follow-up study EDIC 87 and particularly UKPDS Post-Trial Monitoring 90 about cardiovascular risk reduction confirm the existence of this late beneficial cardiovascular protection effect. At the cellular and molecular level, it is plausible that reducing glucose oscillations back into near-normoglycemic limits might arrest or at least decelerate the progression of diabetic vascular damage by slowing the gradual accumulation of advanced glycation end products that are subsequently degraded with intensive glycemic control leading to the legacy effect. The results recently published in a systematic review 115 on a total of 18 studies (8 on T1DM and 10 on T2DM patients) showed that there is increasing evidence indicating a possible link between glycemic variability and the risk of developing both micro- and macrovascular complications as well as mortality among patients with T2DM. In contrast, such a relationship, however, has not been observed in studies evaluating patients with T1DM. In diabetic patients with T2DM, both pre- and postprandial glucose (PPG) peaks seem to promote the development of long-term cardiovascular complications, independently of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c values. The authors of this systematic review also concluded that glycemic variability - in addition to HbA1c levels - should be considered as a target of diabetic therapy. In favor of reducing the progression of CVD risk, the best possible benefit from lowering HbA1c levels to the established HbA1c targets 96,105 in people with T1DM and T2DM derives from the well-known legacy effect that might potentially be strengthened over time by reducing glycemic variability with conduction of SMBG.Conclusion Since its adoption in 1993 with the DCCT, the measurement of HbA1c as a marker for monitoring the glycemic status of people with diabetes has reached such a high level of analytical quality that it is currently suggested also to be used for the diagnosis of diabetes. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be aware of possible interferences during its measurement, depending on many factors including ethnic differences among people with diabetes, pathological conditions such as hemoglobinopathies, and the methods used to determine HbA1c concentrations. However, discussions about the clinical relevance of HbA1c regarding risk reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are ongoing. Beside well-established risk factors for CVD, such as hypertension or hyperlipidemia, glycemic variability as a further risk factor should deserve more attention. As shown by available clinical and non-clinical data, lowering HbA1c concentrations combined with reducing glycemic variability by means of SMBG profiles very soon after the diagnosis of diabetes will likely result in the greater benefit with regard to CVD risk reduction. Future prospective trials assessing the effect of the reduction of glycemic variability on the development of long-term diabetic micro- and macrovascular complications are needed to further strengthen currently available results.

Our data suggest that the increase in BAT thermogenesis may be an additional mechanism whereby pharmacological GLP-1R activation controls energy balance. The increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity worldwide has prompted the need for new therapies. Agonism of the receptor for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is currently one of the most successfully and widely used therapies for T2D. GLP-1 is a product of proglucagon that also gives rise to glucagon (GCG) and oxyntomodulin (OXM) (1). Both GLP-1 and its receptor (GLP-1R) are expressed in peripheral tissues and in areas of the central nervous system (CNS) involved in the control of energy balance. Treatment with GLP-1R agonists improves glycemic control and reduces body weight in diabetic humans (2). Studies in animals have demonstrated that CNS–GLP-1R signaling contributes to the body weight–reducing effect of these agonists (3). GCG is produced in the α cells of the pancreatic islets and is involved in the maintenance of euglycemia. Although its exogenous administration induces body weight loss associated with anorexia and increased energy expenditure (4), GCG has been traditionally dismissed as a potential drug target because of its diabetogenic effects. However, recent preclinical data have shown that simultaneous activation of both GLP-1R and GCG receptor (GCGR) leads to greater efficacy in both glycemic control and weight loss than the activation of GLP-1R alone (5,6). OXM can bind to and activate both GLP-1R and GCGR (7), and studies with rodents (8,9) and humans (10) suggest that it may be efficacious in treating obesity and diabetes. OXM regulates feeding, at least in part, through GLP-1R (7,11). There is evidence that OXM action in the CNS reduces body weight by increasing energy expenditure (12). This may involve activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) metabolism, since intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of OXM reduces the weight of interscapular BAT (iBAT) pads and increases body temperature in rats (12). The relative contribution of GLP-1R and GCGR to this process has never been investigated; however, it is known that GCG regulates iBAT activity, and this may be, at least in part, centrally mediated (13). The contribution of GLP-1R to the control of energy expenditure, and more specifically to BAT metabolism, remains largely unknown. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is essential for control of BAT metabolism by the CNS (14) and is involved in the CNS–GLP-1R control of lipid metabolism in white adipose tissue (WAT) (15). This, in addition to the evidence that GCG may increase BAT thermogenesis through actions in the CNS (13), led us to hypothesize that the action(s) of GCGR and GLP-1R in the brain controls BAT thermogenesis through the SNS. Here, we show that central administration of both GCGR and GLP-1R agonists increased SNS activity to iBAT and induced thermogenesis. Thus, we propose that CNS–GLP-1R may contribute to the control of energy balance by regulating BAT thermogenesis. The existence of functional BAT in adult humans has now been determined (16–18), and effort needs to be directed toward a better understanding of the regulation of this tissue as a target for antiobesity therapeutics. The increase in BAT metabolism described here may contribute to the weight loss induced by GCGR and GLP-1R agonists in both animal models and humans.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSPeptide synthesis. Peptides were synthesized as previously described (6). We used native GLP-1-(7-36)NH2 and OXM. In order to increase the solubility of GCG, we substituted aspartic acid for an asparagine at position 28 and a glutamic acid for a threonine at position 29. The resulting GCG (Asn28, Thr29) was tested in vitro using human embryonic kidney 293 cells cotransfected with the GCGR as previously described (6), and its ability to stimulate cAMP production was indistinguishable from native GCG.Animals. We used single-housed male 12- to 14-week-old C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) or GLP-1R knockout (Glp1r−/−) mice, generated as previously described (19) and bred at the University of Cincinnati. Mice were maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle at 22°C with free access to water and to either a standard chow (Harlan Teklad) or a diabetogenic diet (58% kcal from fat; Research Diets) as indicated. All studies were approved by and performed following the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committees of the University of Cincinnati, University of Iowa, University of Geneva, and Monash University.Administration of peptides and fastingChronic ICV infusion. ICV minipumps (Alzet; Durect, Cupertino, CA) were implanted as previously described (20). The vehicle for GLP-1 and OXM was saline, whereas the vehicle for GCG was PBS. Doses are as specified in RESULTS.Acute ICV injection. ICV cannulae were placed as previously described (20) and secured with glue (Tarzan's grip) and dental cement. Mice were lightly restrained using a cloth, and the peptides were administered through an injector inserted into the guide cannula at a dose of 1 nmol (GLP-1 and OXM) or 0.4 nmol (GCG) in 1.5 μL vehicle. Previous reports demonstrate that comparable ICV doses of GLP-1 (21) and OXM (9) reduce feeding in rats. The injector was left in place for 20 s before removal. Injections were performed just before the onset of the dark phase.Intraperitoneal injection. Mice were injected intraperitoneally before the dark phase with equimolar amounts of peptides as administered in the acute ICV studies—just in a volume of 200 μL vehicle.Fasting/refeeding. Just before the onset of the dark phase, food was removed from the fasting group. At the onset of light, they received back 2 g of food, which was the average amount consumed in 24 h by the GLP-1– and OXM ICV–treated mice in previous experiments.BAT sympathetic nerve recordings. We measured sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in iBAT in mice 1 week after implantation of an ICV cannula. A nerve fascicle projecting to the iBAT pad was isolated, and the recording and anesthesia protocols were carried out as previously described (15). Baseline SNA was recorded for 10 min followed by ICV administration of vehicle (2 μL) or peptide. (GLP-1 and OXM were administered at 1 and 0.1 nmol in 2 μL saline, and GCG was administered at 0.4 nmol in 2 μL PBS.) SNA responses to GLP-1, OXM, GCG, and vehicle were recorded continuously for 240 min; after this procedure, mice were killed with a lethal dose of ketamine/xylazine. The integrated voltage after death (background noise) was subtracted from the total integrated voltage to calculate actual iBAT SNA.BAT temperature telemetry. Temperature-sensitive transmitters (E-mitters; Mini Mitter, Bend, OR) were implanted into a blunt-dissected pocket underneath the iBAT through a 1-cm incision made posterior to the scapulae either simultaneously (for chronic infusion) or 3 days after implantation of ICV cannula (for acute injections). Data were collected via receiver plate (ER-4000; Minimitter). For determination of alterations in iBAT temperature in response to the decreasing environmental temperature, probes were implanted as above; however, mice were housed in chambers with integrated control of ambient temperature and simultaneous measurement of food intake, locomotor activity, and energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry (TSE Systems, Chesterfield, MO).Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps. Mice were fitted with ICV cannula and minipumps administering 2.5 nmol/day GLP-1, OXM, or vehicle as described above. Food intake and body weight were monitored for 3 days. To control for the effect of weight loss on insulin responsiveness, we pair-fed a group of mice to the GLP-1 treatment group. Mice were then reanesthetized (80 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium salt, Esconarkon; Streuli Pharma, Uznach, Switzerland) without previous fasting, and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed as previously described (22). Hepatic glucose production and glucose infusion rate to maintain euglycemia were measured under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions (18 mU/kg, Actrapid HM; Novo Nordisk Pharma, Zurich, Switzerland) using d-[3-3H]glucose (16.6 μCi/kg/min; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).Quantitative PCR. RNA from iBAT, WAT, and liver was extracted using a commercially available kit (RNeasy; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After DNase I treatment (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript-III (Invitrogen), and gene expression was determined by quantitative PCR using gene-specific TaqMan assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Gene expression was evaluated using the Δ-Δ Ct method. The housekeeping gene was HPRT.Plasma measurements. Triiodothyronine (T3) levels were determined by RIA (MP Biomedicals, Cleveland, OH) following the manufacturer’s instructions.Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means ± SEM. Student t test for independent samples was used for comparisons between two groups. Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction test or Tukey post hoc test was used for comparisons between multiple, independent groups.RESULTS ICV GLP-1, OXM, and GCG significantly reduced food intake and body weight over a 4-day period as expected (Fig. 1). Infusion of either GLP-1 or OXM at 0.75 nmol/day in chow-fed and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice significantly decreased food intake (Fig. 1A and B) and body weight (Fig. 1C and D) across the 4 days. GCG was infused at 0.4 nmol/day because of limitations of solubility. At this dose, GCG reduced feeding only in DIO mice (Fig. 1E and F). However, ICV GCG significantly reduced body weight in both chow- and high-fat–fed mice (Fig. 1G and H) (P < 0.05). This decrease in body weight is consistent with increased energy expenditure previously attributed to GCG (4).FIG. 1. Central chronic infusion of GLP-1R and GCGR agonists induces sustained body weight (BW) loss. ICV GLP-1 and OXM significantly reduced feeding (A, chow fed and B, DIO) and body weight (C, chow fed and D, DIO) in chow-fed and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed DIO mice. ICV GCG did not affect feeding in lean chow-fed mice (E) but reduced food intake in DIO mice (F). Despite the lack of an anorectic effect, ICV GCG significantly reduced body weight in lean chow-fed mice (G) and in DIO mice (H). Data are expressed as mean ± SE percentage of change (for body weight) or kilojoules (kJ) (for food intake) vs. the corresponding control group (n = 6–8). A significant main effect was required before post hoc testing. (P < 0.05, two-way repeated-measures ANOVA.) **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05 vs. corresponding vehicle (VH); two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. For C and D, the asterisks above relate to OXM, and those below relate to GLP-1. Given that one of the mechanisms by which GCG induces energy expenditure is by activating iBAT thermogenesis, we measured iBAT temperature after an acute ICV injection of GCG in mice. ICV GCG (bolus dose of 0.4 nmol) caused a trend toward increased iBAT thermogenesis across a 24-h recording window (P = 0.08) (Fig. 2A). Consistent with its activity as GCGR agonist, ICV administration of OXM significantly increased iBAT temperature during the 24 h after injection (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, ICV GLP-1 injection also increased iBAT temperature (Fig. 2C). The average iBAT temperature across the first half of the dark phase was significantly higher for all three peptides (Fig. 2D–F). Again, GCG did not affect feeding (Fig. 2G). The increase in iBAT temperature induced by ICV OXM or GLP-1 occurred despite the profound suppression of food intake assessed 2 h post injection (Fig. 2H and I). Food intake at 24 h was not different from vehicle-treated controls for any group (data not shown).FIG. 2. Acute central injection of GLP-1R and GCGR agonists increases BAT thermogenesis. BAT temperature (Temp) was increased with acute ICV administration of GCG (A), OXM (B), and GLP-1 (C). Repeated-measures ANOVA showed significant main effects for GLP-1 and OXM and a main-effect P value of 0.08 for GCG across the 24-h period. Average iBAT temperature over the first half of the dark phase was significantly higher for all compounds (D-F) as determined by a t test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). Two-hour food intake after injection and onset of the dark phase was significantly depressed in OXM (H) and GLP-1 (I) but unaffected with GCG (G) as determined by a t test (**P < 0.01). J: 12 h of fasting significantly reduces iBAT temperature, with normal temperature reinstated after a meal (2 g chow, indicated by arrow); repeated-measures ANOVA shows significant main effect during the dark phase only (P < 0.05). K: Intraperitoneal injection of the same nanomole dose of peptides as used in A–I did not affect iBAT thermogenesis; individual t tests for each dark and light phase, P > 0.05. In contrast with ICV GLP-1 (N), ICV GCG, OXM, or food restriction did not significantly affect the home cage locomotor activity (Loc. Act) despite their effect on iBAT temperature (L, M, and O, respectively). Data are expressed as means ± SE (n = 6–8). ***P < 0.01 vs. vehicle (VH); two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. hr, hour; Ad Lib, ad libitum; cnts, counts. Our expectation was that reduced food intake associated with fasting would normally cause a decrease in thermogenesis as an energy-preservation mechanism; however, to rule out the possibility that the reduced food intake itself could drive an increase in iBAT temperature, we performed an experiment designed to mirror the feeding behavior of the GLP-1– and OXM-treated mice. Fasting during the dark phase significantly lowered iBAT temperature by the end of the 12-h period (P < 0.05), and the reinstatement of food completely restored normal iBAT temperature (Fig. 2J). In contrast to ICV injection, intraperitoneal administration of equimolar doses of the peptides did not increase iBAT temperature (Fig. 2K), further suggesting that this effect requires signaling at the CNS. Home cage locomotion remained unchanged either after ICV GCG (Fig. 4M) or OXM (Fig. 4L) or after fasting (Fig. 4O) but was significantly suppressed during the first hour after ICV GLP-1, consistent with previous findings in rats (21). SNA is a necessary component of CNS-mediated BAT thermogenesis. We measured SNA from the nerves innervating iBAT after acute ICV administration of the peptides. All peptides increased iBAT-SNA (Fig. 3A–C). The average SNA for the final hour of recording was significantly higher for all groups (Fig. 3D–F), demonstrating that GCG, OXM, and GLP-1 are capable of independently increasing sympathetic drive to iBAT.FIG. 3. Acute central injection of GLP-1R and GCGR agonists increases electrophysiological activity of the sympathetic fibers that innervate the iBAT. Activity of sympathetic nerves projecting to iBAT increased after acute ICV administration of GCG (A), OXM (B), or GLP-1 (C). Repeated-measures ANOVA shows a significant main effect for all compounds at all doses; P < 0.01. D–F: Histograms on the right show average % increase for final hour, which was significant for all compounds as determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc (D and E) and Student t test (F) (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). Data are expressed as means ± SE (n = 6–8). VH, vehicle. Given that both GLP-1R and GCGR bind OXM and since we had demonstrated that the cognate ligands for both receptors increase iBAT thermogenesis, we used mice with genetic disruption of the Glp1r to identify the relative contribution of this receptor to OXM’s thermogenic capacity. To this end, we infused OXM into GLP-1R knockout mice (Glp1r−/−). In contrast to a robust thermogenic OXM response in the WT littermate controls (Fig. 4A), Glp1r−/− mice had no thermogenic response to OXM when they were continuously infused by mini-pump (Fig. 4B). The average iBAT temperature in OXM-treated WT mice was significantly higher than in vehicle-treated mice during both the dark and light phases (Fig. 4C), while there were no significant differences in the Glp1r−/− mice (Fig. 4D). The sustained increase in iBAT temperature induced by ICV OXM did not correlate with plasma T3 levels (Fig. 4E). Importantly, the effect of ICV OXM on iBAT temperature persisted beyond the effect on food intake in the WT mice (Fig. 4F). As expected, there were no differences in feeding between groups in the Glp1r−/− mice (Fig. 4G). Likewise, ICV OXM did not alter locomotor activity (Fig. 4H and I).FIG. 4. Chronic CNS infusion of OXM induces a sustained increase in BAT thermogenesis that requires a functional GLP-1R. ICV infusion of OXM induces a sustained increase in iBAT thermogenesis over the course of 6 days in WT mice (A), which is completely absent in the Glp1r−/− mouse (B). The average increase over 5 days in iBAT temperature induced by OXM is significant in both the light and dark phases in WT mice (C) but not in the Glp1r−/− mice (D). The ICV OXM–induced iBAT thermogenesis does not correlate with increased plasma T3, as measured at the end of the study (E). Food intake (F and G) and home cage locomotor activity (Loc. Act) (H and I) of WT and Glp1r−/− mice during the period of ICV OXM infusion. Data are expressed as means ± SE (n = 6–8). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 vs. corresponding vehicle (VH); two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. KO, knockout; cnts, counts. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that mediate the thermogenic action of OXM, we assessed the effect of ICV OXM for 72 h on the iBAT gene expression profile in WT and Glp1r−/− mice. Given that during this period ICV OXM significantly reduced food intake and body weight (Fig. 1A), we pair-fed the WT vehicle control group to allow for comparisons independent of feeding effects. As a result of pair-feeding, both WT vehicle and OXM-infused mice lost a similar amount of weight during the duration of the infusion (WT saline −10.6 ± 0.4% vs. WT OXM −10.1 ± 1.8%; Glp1r−/− saline −3.4 ± 1% vs. Glp1r−/− OXM −4.3 ± 0.8%) (WT vs. knockout, P < 0.001). ICV OXM in WT, but not in Glp1r−/− mice, increased the expression of genes associated with higher thermogenic activity of BAT. Specifically, ICV OXM increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1a) and its genetic target uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), the key protein responsible for thermogenesis in the mitochondria (Fig. 5A and B), although this increase did not result in a detectable change in UCP-1 protein content (data not shown). UCP-1 expression in the inguinal and retroperitoneal white fat pads was not altered (data not shown). ICV OXM also increased the expression of type II iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO2) in BAT, required for the intracellular conversion of thyroxine (T4) to 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T3) (Fig. 5C). Consistent with a higher adrenergic stimulation, ICV OXM significantly increased the expression of the metabolic regulator fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in iBAT (Fig. 5D). In contrast, FGF21 gene expression levels did not increase in the inguinal or retroperitoneal fat pads or in the liver (data not shown). ICV OXM increased monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), GLUT4, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which are involved in the transport of metabolites across cell membranes (Fig. 5E–G). ICV OXM increased acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression, suggesting that it stimulates lipogenesis in BAT. In contrast, ICV OXM did not affect the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1b (Fig. 5J), required for the transport of fatty acids inside of the mitochondria, or increased expression of genes involved in the iBAT differentiation (PRDM16) (Fig. 5K) or mitochondrial biogenesis (nuclear respiratory factor-1 [NRF-1]) (Fig. 5L).FIG. 5. CNS infusion of OXM increases the expression of genes involved in thermogenesis in the iBAT of WT mice but not in Glp1r−/− mice. PGC1a (A), UCP-1 (B), DIO2 (C), and FGF21 (D) gene expression in BAT is increased in WT but not in GLP-1R knockout mice after 3-day ICV OXM infusion. Similarly, ICV OXM increased the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism, such as MCT1 (E), GLUT-4 (F), LPL (G), AACS (H), FASN (I), CPT1B (J), PRDM16(K), and NRF1(L) in iBAT of WT mice. WT vehicle (VH)-treated mice were pair-fed with the WT OXM group. Data are expressed as means ± SE (n = 6–8). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, **P < 0.001 vs. corresponding vehicle; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. KO, knockout; a.u., arbitrary unit. In order to assess whether the increase in iBAT metabolism could be associated with changes in insulin responsiveness, we performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in mice treated ICV for 3 days with either GLP-1 or OXM or pair-fed to the GLP-1 group. ICV OXM and GLP-1 reduced body weight but did not significantly affect peripheral insulin responsiveness compared with pair-fed mice (Table 1). These data suggest that CNS–GLP-1R specifically regulates iBAT thermogenesis, independent of changes in food intake or glucose homeostasis.TABLE 1 Parameters of hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp In view of the significant and sustained increase in iBAT temperature induced by CNS–GLP-1R signaling, we hypothesized that GLP-1R may be required for the appropriate stimulation of iBAT metabolism by cold exposure. To test this, we compared the response of Glp1r−/− mice to their WT littermates when exposed to ambient cold. We were not able to detect any differences in food intake, locomotor activity, whole-body energy expenditure, or iBAT temperature (Fig. 6A–D) between Glp1r−/− mice and WT littermates during extended, decremental cold exposure from 24 to 14°C. Additionally, both genotypes maintained a stable core temperature over 8 h of acute cold exposure at 4°C (Fig. 6E). However, since nonshivering thermogenesis is not essential for the maintenance of body core temperature (BCT) in response to an acute cold exposure (14), these data do not exclude the possibility that Glp1r−/− mice may have impaired activation of the thermogenic pathways in iBAT in response to an acute cold challenge. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of genes required for the activation of the iBAT thermogenesis in response to a 2-h cold exposure at 4°C in another cohort of lean, chow-fed WT and Glp1r−/− mice. Although the 2-h cold challenge was insufficient to induce higher UCP-1 gene expression (Fig. 6F), it led to a significant increase in PGC-1a and DIO2 expression in both WT and Glp1r−/− mice (Fig. 6G and H) compared with control mice maintained at room temperature. Despite similar body weights (WT 26.3 ± 0.9 g vs. knockout 24.4 ± 0.9 g, P > 0.05) and adiposity (Fig. 6I), Glp1r−/− mice showed significantly higher iBAT mass (Fig. 6J). These data demonstrate that GLP-1R signaling is not essential for the activation of iBAT in response to cold but suggest that it is required for normal control of iBAT function.FIG. 6. GLP-1R signaling is not critical for the control of BAT thermogenesis in response to changes in ambient temperature. WT and Glp1r−/− mice implanted with a telemeter temperature transmitter in the iBAT were exposed to decreasing ambient temperature from 24 to 14°C in decrements of 2°C per day. The decrease in ambient temperature led to a similar increase in food intake (A) in both WT and Glp1r−/− mice paralleled by an increase in locomotor activity (Loc. Act) (B) and energy expenditure (EE) (C). Both WT and knockout mice maintained similar iBAT temperature, including circadian-dependent oscillations (D). E–J: Response to an acute cold exposure: WT and Glp1r−/− mice fed with standard chow ad libitum and housed always at room temperature were singly housed and exposed to 4°C for 8 h. BCT was measured using a rectal probe (E). Another set of mice was exposed to 4°C for 2 h before euthanasia, while the corresponding control groups were maintained at room temperature. UCP-1 (F), PGC1a (G), and DIO2 (H) gene expression was assessed in BAT. Fat mass was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance to calculate adiposity (I). iBAT was carefully dissected and weighed (J). Food was removed at the beginning of the cold exposure, which started 2 h after the onset of the light phase. Data are expressed as means ± SE (A–E, n = 8; F–J, n = 5–6). ##P < 0.01 Glp1r−/− vs. WT; ***P < 0.001 vs. corresponding vehicle; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test.

A new generation of drugs combining both GLP-1R and GCGR have demonstrated further potency in reducing body weight in preclinical animal models. Yet, the specific mechanisms whereby either the GLP-1R or GCGR contributes to the reduction of body weight are not completely understood. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to body weight loss, ICV administration of the pre-proglucagon-derived peptides GLP-1, OXM, and GCG increases iBAT thermogenesis by increasing SNS activity and without altering peripheral insulin responsiveness. Although GLP-1R activation potently induces iBAT thermogenesis, endogenous physiological GLP-1R signaling is not essential for normal induction of cold-induced iBAT thermogenesis. We propose that iBAT thermogenesis may be one of the multiple mechanisms by which, along with reduced food intake (21) and decreased lipid accumulation in WAT (15), pharmacological CNS–GLP-1R activation contributes to the maintenance of energy balance. Although there is old evidence for the role of GCG in the control of energy balance, its low solubility has been a limiting factor for studying its effects in vivo. Here, we overcome that limitation by using a more hydrophilic GCG analog. The food intake–independent effect on body weight that we observed in ICV GCG–treated mice supports a role for GCG in stimulating energy expenditure. One of the proposed mechanisms by which GCG increases energy expenditure is through the activation of iBAT thermogenesis (23,24). Pretreatment with a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist abolishes the effect of GCG on oxygen consumption in rats in vivo, suggesting that the effect of GCG on iBAT may be attributed to, at least in part, the release catecholamines (25). Adrenergic signaling is a critical regulator of iBAT metabolism and is mainly provided to the iBAT by SNS innervation. Given that in our experiments acute ICV GCG increases both iBAT thermogenesis and the activity of the SNS fibers innervating the BAT, we suggest that the CNS mediates some of the effects of GCG on energy expenditure by increasing iBAT thermogenesis via SNS. Whether the brain is a target for GCG has been a matter of debate, but others have shown that GCGR signaling in the CNS contributes to the control of energy balance (26,27). Furthermore, the GCGR is expressed in the rat brain (28), and immunohistochemical studies have reported GCG immunoreactivity in the CNS of humans and rodents (29,30). Despite this evidence, the exact neuroanatomical substrate for the control of iBAT metabolism by CNS-GCG signaling remains to be fully characterized. OXM may play a role in the control of energy expenditure (12). As yet, no distinct OXM receptor has been described; its effects have been attributed to its interaction with either GLP-1R or GCGR (7). The increase in the iBAT thermogenesis induced by ICV OXM is consistent with its partial agonism on the GCGR; however, here we show that ICV GLP-1 increases iBAT thermogenesis, and we demonstrate that the classical Glp1r is required for the activation of the iBAT by ICV OXM. Surprisingly, we did not see any residual thermogenic effect of ICV OXM in the Glp1r−/− mice that could be attributed to activation of the GCGR by OXM. These findings strengthen the role of the GLP-1R in the control of iBAT thermogenesis; however, we cannot exclude that the GCGR contributes to the iBAT activation induced by ICV OXM in WT mice. Similarly to OXM, GCG can activate the GLP-1R (31), but this requires concentrations well in excess of those used here where we infused GCG, OXM, and GLP-1 in the same molar range. Future studies involving the ICV infusion of OXM and GCG in GCGR-deficient mice may contribute to understanding the specific role of GCGR in the iBAT activation by GCG and OXM. Interestingly, both OXM and GLP-1 increase iBAT temperature despite inducing a profound anorexia. This is important because food restriction is accompanied by a decrease in iBAT metabolism (Fig. 2J) associated with lower sympathetic signaling (14), which appears to be circumvented after central GLP-1R activation. There is evidence that CNS–GLP-1 contributes to the control of BCT, although the mechanisms through which it does so are not well characterized. The GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 reduces BCT in conscious rats (32–34) and mice (35). This is, at least in part, attributed to hindbrain GLP-1R signaling (33). Intriguingly, acute intravenous or ICV administration of GLP-1 increases BCT in anesthetized rats (36) and ICV OXM increases rectal temperature in the same animal model (12). OXM does not affect BCT in WT mice but reduces it in dopamine β-hydroxylase–deficient mice that lack adrenergic signaling (37), raising the possibility that CNS–GLP-1R simultaneously regulates several mechanisms involved in the control of BCT, one of which induces hyperthermia and requires adrenergic signaling. Our data suggest that this is iBAT thermogenesis. The GLP-1R–dependent increase in iBAT thermogenesis induced by ICV OXM is consistent with both the increase in iBAT SNS activity and the expression changes in iBAT genes that reflect increased adrenergic signal, namely, increased levels of PGC1a, UCP-1, DIO2, and FGF21 (Fig. 5A–C). Hepatic FGF21 contributes to the activation of iBAT thermogenesis in neonates (38) and in iBAT increases after cold exposure in vivo or after incubation of brown adipocytes with adrenergic receptor agonists in vitro (39,40); however, the role of BAT-derived FGF21 remains to be fully elucidated. ICV OXM also increased the expression of genes involved in the uptake of metabolic substrates from the extracellular space, such as MCT-1, GLUT4, and LPL. MCT-1 is the most abundant monocarboxylate transporter in iBAT (41) and regulates the uptake of lactate and ketone bodies. The increase in GLUT4 expression suggests that CNS–GLP-1 signaling contributes to increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in BAT. This is supported by recent data showing that a long-lasting GLP-1 agonist similarly increases insulin responsiveness in this tissue (42). Cold exposure increases plasma triglyceride uptake (43), as well as lipogenesis in iBAT (44,45). Thus, the increased expression of LPL, AACS, and FASN after ICV OXM in WT mice further supports the role of SNS mediating the CNS–GLP-1R control of iBAT metabolism. Interestingly, Glp1r−/− mice have increased percentage of iBAT mass per mouse. Although the cause of this increase remains to be elucidated, it is consistent with a decreased SNS tone in iBAT, given that mice with impaired adrenergic signaling have larger iBAT (46,47). In view of the CNS–GLP-1R induction of iBAT thermogenesis, we tested the importance of this receptor in overall thermoregulatory control by challenging WT mice and GLP-1R–deficient littermates with cold exposure. Glp1r−/− mice maintained appropriate iBAT thermogenesis and BCT in response to cold exposure. Thus, assuming that Glp1r−/− mice do not display any compensatory adaptation for the congenital loss of GLP-1R, we can conclude that GLP-1R signaling is not essential to regulate homeothermia. In summary, in this study, we demonstrate that both GCGR and GLP-1R action in the CNS control iBAT thermogenesis. Although GLP-1R is not essential for homeothermic control in response to ambient cold, it uses the common efferent mechanisms, namely, the SNS, to increase iBAT thermogenesis. We propose that iBAT thermogenesis is one of the multiple mechanisms by which, along with the control of feeding and WAT metabolism, pharmacological CNS–GLP-1R contributes to the maintenance of energy balance.

Clinical pharmacist can play an important role in nurse training as an effective method to reduce drug-food interactions in hospitals. Introduction Drug-food interactions are important aspects of treatment among hospitalized patients. Foods may alter the effects of drugs by interfering with pharmacokinetic such as absorption, metabolism and excretion. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms also play a critical role in drug food interactions by altering drug effects (1). Lewis designed a study to assess the risk of drug-food interactions in 3 long-term-care facilities in central New York State. Fifty three patients were selected randomly from each facility. Data was gained from the medical files during 6 months and a computerized algorithm was used to assess the risk for drug-food interactions. They showed that there are 1.43, 2.69, and 1.43 per patient per month potential drug-food interactions respectively in 3 facilities (2). Absorption drug-food interactions occur when drug or food or both interact in absorption of each other. For instance, absorption of captopril decreases significantly if it is not taken with an empty stomach. On the contrary, the curing effect of some drugs might be adversely affected by meals (3). Patients need to be aware of the preventive ways of absorption food-drug interaction regarding its importance so that they would control their drug usage in order to get the best effect of the treatment. Focusing on educating patients and healthcare workers absolutely helps in this regard (4). Many methods were utilized to reduce drug-food interactions including drug prescription standard tables (4), hospital newsletters (5), educational in services (6), label systems (7), patient written and/or verbal counseling (8) and finally computerized interaction control (9). The role of clinical pharmacist in reduction of absorption drug-food interactions by nurse education was evaluated through this study after measuring the rate of interactions before and after the intervention.Experimental This study was an interventional research in a before-after design from April 2007 to December 2008 in a teaching hospital affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Four wards with the greatest prescription rate of oral drugs during the past 6 months were selected to carry out the study. This information was gathered from the central pharmacy of the hospital. Patients hospitalized in four wards (gastrointestinal-liver; vascular surgery; endocrine and nephrology) were evaluated for drug-food interaction rate before and after nurse-training. This study was carried out in three distinct phases: Phase 1: Observation before training Drug-food interactions were recorded prospectively by a trained pharmacy student via monitoring drug and food consumption. Monitoring was done via direct observations during hospitalisation for each patient. Drug-food interactions were defined as “taking drugs away from the suitable time related to food consumption based on drug information textbooks”. International references of drug-food interactions (10, 11), define two categories of drugs. These are defined in our study as: • Drugs that must be taken in a specific manner regarding food consumption. • Drugs without any significant interactions with food. Patients in each ward were observed for a time period of 2 months with consideration of turnover rate of the wards. There are 3 distinct working shifts (morning, afternoon and night) in each ward. As nurses were changed in each working shift, the observer attended different shifts in the wards. Phase 2: Nursing staff training During the second phase, all the nurses working in the four wards received training about all aspects of drug-food interactions via attending the classes supervised by a clinical pharmacist and by giving the information pamphlets in which the guiding tables of drug and food usage were illustrated. Pamphlets were prepared and distributed to the nurses by the same clinical pharmacist. These actions were managed by the nursing management department of the hospital with the aim of upgrading the knowledge of registered nursing staff and didn’t interfere with their normal work shift. Phase 3: Re-Observation after nurse training The third phase started one month later after nurse training in each ward to re-evaluate drug-food interactions using the interaction categories mentioned previously. This phase was done in 1 month and like phase 1, the observer attended the wards at different working shifts. Data analysis Data were analyzed using “Mini Tab” statistical software and compared by chi-squared test. p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.Results and Discussion Direct observations of drug-food interactions were done for 460 hospitalized patients. Overall, 7000 direct observations were done during the study among which 5244 belonged to the first phase and 1756 to the third one. Drug usage observations were classified to 2 categories included: A: Drugs which must be used in a specific way regarding food. B: Drugs which do not have any specific way of being used regarding food and patients can take them without any concern about food. Observations in category “A” showed that there were drugs used in correct (A1) and incorrect (A2) ways. Table 1 illustrates these results in each ward separately.Table 1 Comparison between the wards for incorrect drug consumption rates before and after the nurse education courses Before education Total observations A B A 1 (% from A) A 2 (% from A) GI-Liver 1384865519456 (52.7)409 (47.3) Vascular surgery 1236736500381 (51.8)355 (48.2) Endocrinology 1303816487466 (57.1)350 (42.9) Nephrology 1321787534471 (59.8)316 (40.2) Total 5244320420401774 (55.4)1430 (44.6) After education Total observations A B A 1 (% from A) A 2 (% from A) GI-Liver 403287116157 (54.7)130 (45.3) Vascular surgery 270153117100 (65.4)53 (34.6) Endocrinology 557393164287 (73)106 (27) Nephrology 526417109312 (74.8)105 (25.2) Total 17561250506856 (68.5)394 (31.5) A: Drug usage observations that must be in a specific way regarding food. B: Drug usage observations that have not a specific way of usage regarding food. A1: Drug observations of category A that usages were in correct way. A2: Drug observations of category A that usages were in incorrect way. Most of the incorrect usages were observed with Hydrochlorothiazide, Captopril and Gemfibrozil in both phase 1 and phase 3. Data showed that 44.6% of drug-takings through the first phase were incorrect regarding the food. The Vascular surgery ward had the most incorrect drug consumption pattern followed by the gastrointestinal- liver, endocrinology and nephrology wards, respectively. Total incorrect drug consumption was 31.5% in the phase 3, after the nurse training. The gastrointestinal-liver ward had the most percentage of incorrect drug-taking followed by the wards of vascular surgery, endocrinology and nephrology, respectively. This means that total incorrect consumption rate of drug regarding food in the mentioned wards fell by 13.1% after training the nurses. Furthermore, a significant reduction of incorrect usage of drug were revealed after training the nurses of vascular surgery, endocrinology and nephrology wards, (p < 0.002, p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) although no significant reduction was found in gastrointestinal-liver ward in this matter (p = 0.56). Nurses, the main target population in this study, were asked for age, sex and the period of work-time in the wards. The ratio of beds on nurses was defined in each ward, separately. These data are illustrated in Table 2.Table 2 Characteristics of studied nurses and wards Wards Nurses Number of beds Ratio of beds(n) /nurses(n) Total Male Female Average experience(Yrs) Gastrointestinal-liver 132115.650 Vascular surgery 60610.1203.3 Endocrinology 8267.8202.5 Nephrology 7077.4202.8 Physicians, pharmacists and nurses are three healthcare professionals who are trained in the roles and side effects of drugs and ways to reduce many adverse outcomes of prescribing them. Their knowledge and role in patient education in various areas is also important. It is likely that these healthcare professionals lack time and knowledge of properly manage drug-food interactions. Heavy work loads and insufficient training may contribute to this. Hayley et al. studied 30 healthcare workers in 7 wards including physicians, pharmacists and nurses. They found that only 66.6% of them have some knowledge of drug-good interactions (12). There are few studies about the effect of nurse education in prevention or alleviation of drug-food interactions (5, 6). Gauthier evaluated the effect of 2 interventions on decreasing drug nutrient interactions: 1-placement of a brightly colored label in the medication drawer and on the cover of the nursing medication card flip-chart, 2-placement of the labels plus a five-minute structured patient-counseling session. These interventions caused 19% and 16% decrease in rate of drug nutrient interactions, respectively (7). By using educational in services, DePestel et al. showed that training the nurses reduced the rate of interactions of fluoroquinolone and tetracycline with multivalent cations no more than 10% (13). As the nurses are the last link of treatment chain in the hospital, hypothesis of the study was that the nurse training of drug regarding food interactions could decrease drug-food interactions rate in the hospital. Unlike Depetsel et al., we prefer to evaluate the nurse education by attending the classes and giving educational pamphlets of drug regarding food interactions. Average experience of evaluated nurses was not less than 5 years in this study. In this case, a great deal of theoretical knowledge would be forgotten because of their daily act and business. In this study, we chose direct nurse education method of drug regarding food interactions by clinical pharmacist. It has been shown that drug-food interactions decreased by 13.1% after nurse training. It was observed that unlike the other wards, the gastrointestinal-liver ward did not show a significant reduction in errors following the nurse training (p = 0.56). May be the higher bed to nurse ratio in this ward leads such a result. Nurses in this ward also had less experience than the other wards. The periodic provision of training the nurses should be part of the normal role of the clinical pharmacists and be allowed in their work requirement. It suggests that educational programs about drug-food interactions should be provided periodically to nurses by clinical pharmacist.

Patients that inherit an inactivating mutation in the gene develop lung collapse as well as tumors in the kidney, colon, and skin. It is not clear yet what the exact function of this protein is in the cell or an organism. In this study, we used a simple model organism (the round worm ) to study the function of FLCN. We found that it is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism in the cell. FLCN normally binds and blocks the action of another protein (AMPK), which is involved in the maintenance of energy levels. When energy levels fall, AMPK is activated and drives a recycling pathway called autophagy, where cellular components are recycled producing energy. In the absence of FLCN in worms and mammalian cells, like in tumors of BHD patients, AMPK and autophagy are chronically activated leading to an increased energy level, which makes the cells/organism very resistant to many stresses that would normally kill them, which in the end could lead to progression of tumorigenesis.

Introduction Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is an autosomal dominant neoplasia disorder that was originally described by Hornstein and Knickenberg in 1975 and by Birt, Hogg, and Dubé in 1977 as a disorder associated with colon polyps and fibrofolliculomas of the skin [1], [2]. Toro et al. recognized in 1999 that BHD patients were also predisposed to develop kidney cancer mostly of the onococytic, chromophobe, or mixed subtype [3]. However, later studies showed a predisposition for all subtypes of kidney cancer including clear cell and papillary subtypes [4]. In addition, BHD confers an increased risk of pulmonary cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and cysts of the kidney, pancreas, and liver [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. The gene responsible for BHD, FLCN, was mapped to chromosome 17p11.2 by linkage analysis [15], [16] and identified in 2002 by positional cloning [14]. FLCN encodes a novel cytoplasmic 64kDa protein FLCN, which is expressed in most epithelial tissues [17]. BHD patients carry a loss of function germline mutation in one FLCN allele and acquire a second hit somatic mutation or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the remaining wild-type copy in their renal tumors [18], [19]. In addition, strains of rats, mice, and dogs with a germline mutation in the Flcn gene developed spontaneous kidney tumors with a loss of function in the second allele pointing to a tumor suppressor function of FLCN [20], [21], [22], [23]. However, homozygous deletion of Flcn resulted in embryonic lethality in these species [24], [25]. Finally, ablation or restoration of FLCN in human cancer cells revealed tumor suppressor function in xenograft and soft agar assays [24], [26]. Though the FLCN protein presents no significant homology to any known protein, it is highly conserved from unicellular organisms (yeast) through mammalian species (rodents, dog, humans). Moreover, two 130 kDa folliculin-interacting proteins, FNIP1 and FNIP2 have been identified [27], [28], [29] and implicated in some of the FLCN phenotypes in B-cell and stem cell differentiation, and the regulation of apoptosis upon DNA damage [30], [31], [32], [33]. Several studies identified both FLCN and FNIP1/2 as AMPK (5′AMP-activated protein kinase) binding proteins [28], [34], [35], [36]. However, no clear role for FLCN/FNIP1/2 in AMPK function has been described, since both inhibition and stimulation of AMPK have been reported upon loss of function of these genes [32], [37]. Strikingly, the majority of naturally occurring FLCN mutations predisposing to BHD were predicted to generate truncated proteins unable to bind AMPK pointing to an essential role of this interaction in the tumor suppressor function. Since we and others have observed that FLCN regulates cellular metabolism [37], [38], [39], we hypothesized that FLCN may regulate cellular energy metabolism through its interaction with AMPK. AMPK is an evolutionarily conserved master regulator of energy metabolism [40], [41], [42]. When energy levels drop, AMP or ADP bind to the γ regulatory subunit of AMPK and induce an allosteric conformational change [43], [44]. This change leads to the activation of AMPK through phosphorylation of a critical threonine residue (Thr172) in the catalytic subunit and inhibition of its dephosphorylation. When animals and cells encounter stressful environmental conditions leading to lower energy levels, activated AMPK phosphorylates downstream metabolic targets to generate ATP and maintain bioenergetics [40], [41], [42]. For instance, AMPK activates autophagy, a lysosome-dependent degradation process that recycles cytosolic components to generate new cellular components and produce energy [45]. Recently, AMPK was shown to activate autophagy via binding and phosphorylation of the autophagy initiation kinase ULK1, Beclin 1, and Vps34 [46], [47], [48]. Since studies in mammalian cells have led to unclear roles for FLCN in AMPK function, we decided to study the genetic relationship between FLCN and AMPK in the model organism C. elegans. FLCN and AMPK are conserved in C. elegans and loss-of-function mutants are viable. AMPK activation promotes lifespan extension in C. elegans [49], [50], [51], [52] and increases resistance to oxidative and other stresses [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57]. Here we show that FLCN controls a distinct evolutionarily conserved energy stress pathway by acting as a negative regulator of AMPK function. Loss of FLCN function led to constitutive AMPK activation, which increased autophagy, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis, higher bioenergetics, thereby enhancing survival to several metabolic stresses. Specifically, we find that the chronic activation of autophagy upon loss of FLCN modifies cellular metabolism, providing an energetic advantage that is sufficient to survive metabolic stresses such as oxidative stress, heat, and anoxia. We confirmed these C. elegans results in FLCN- deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and human cancer cells demonstrating strong conservation of this pathway throughout evolution. Our results demonstrate that FLCN inhibits AMPK and autophagy functions, which may lead to inhibition of tumorigenesis.ResultsLoss of flcn-1 confers resistance to oxidative stress in C. elegans The FLCN gene product is highly conserved from C. elegans to humans with 28% identity and 50% similarity (Figure 1A). To determine the function of FLCN and whether it genetically interacts with AMPK in C. elegans, we used a strain carrying the flcn-1(ok975) mutation. The ok975 mutation is an 817 bp insertion-deletion, predicted to truncate the protein at residue 141 resulting in a null or loss-of-function allele (Figure 1B). In accordance, the C. elegans FLCN-1 polyclonal antibody that we developed recognized a gene product at the predicted size in N2 wild-type but not in flcn-1(ok975) animals (Figure 1C). Importantly, we did not detect obvious developmental or morphological defects in flcn-1(ok975) animals compared to wild-type.10.1371/journal.pgen.1004273.g001Figure 1Loss of flcn-1 confers resistance to oxidative stress in C. elegans.

(E-H) Percent survival of indicated worm strains treated with 4 mM or 100 mM PQ (also see Tables S2, S3). (I) Percent survival of indicated worm strains treated with 7.5 mM H2O2. The C. elegans AMPK ortholog (aak-2; α2 catalytic subunit) modulates longevity and tolerance to stresses including oxidative stress, heat, anoxia, and dietary restriction [49], [50], [51], [52], [54], [56]. Since we did not observe a difference in lifespan between wild-type and flcn-1(ok975) animals (Figure 1D and Table S1), we investigated the function of FLCN-1 in stress response by treatment of animals with mild and acute oxidative stress. The flcn-1(ok975) mutation conferred an increased resistance to 4 mM and 100 mM paraquat (PQ), a superoxide inducer [58], which could be rescued in two different transgenic lines expressing FLCN-1 (Figures 1E and 1F and Tables S2 and S3). In addition, treatment with flcn-1 RNAi increased the resistance of wild-type animals to low and high concentrations of PQ but did not further increase the resistance of the flcn-1(ok975) mutant animals, supporting that the ok975 mutation is a loss-of-function allele (Figures 1G and 1H). A similar resistance phenotype was observed upon H2O2 treatment and was rescued with the two transgenic lines expressing flcn-1 (Figures 1I and S1A). To exclude the possibility that the changes in stress resistance are not due to effects on lifespan of the animals, assays performed on 4 mM PQ were accompanied with lifespan controls (Table S2). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that loss of FLCN increases resistance to oxidative stress in C. elegans.Loss of flcn-1 confers an aak-2-dependent resistance to oxidative stress Since FLCN binds to AMPK in mammalian cells, we aimed to determine whether flcn-1 and aak-2 interact genetically in C. elegans. Similarly to published results [50], [51], [52], [54], aak-2(ok524) mutant animals were more sensitive to PQ stress compared to wild-type (Figures 2A and 2B and Tables S2 and S3). Strikingly, flcn-1(ok975); aak-2(ok524) double mutant animals displayed reduced survival upon treatment with 4 mM PQ (Figure 2A and Table S2) and 100 mM PQ (Figure 2B and Table S3), similarly to aak-2(ok524) single mutants, indicating that aak-2(ok524) is required for the flcn-1(ok975) phenotype. The C. elegans AMPKα1 homolog (AAK-1) was previously shown to be dispensable for oxidative stress resistance [54]. Accordingly, the aak-1(tm1944) mutation did not abolish the increased survival of flcn-1(ok975) mutants to PQ (Figure 2C and Table S3). To further test whether the increased survival of flcn-1(ok975) mutants was also dependent on PAR-4, the C. elegans ortholog of LKB1 and major upstream kinase of AMPK [40], [54], we measured survival to PQ upon par-4 loss. Interestingly, par-4(it57), a strong loss of function allele, only partially suppressed the flcn-1(ok975) survival phenotype, leading to a significant increase in the resistance of flcn-1(ok975); par-4(it57) animals to PQ compared to par-4(it57) animals alone, suggesting that additional inputs might activate AAK-2 to mediate survival (Figure 2D and Table S3).10.1371/journal.pgen.1004273.g002Figure 2Loss of flcn-1 confers an aak-2-dependent resistance to oxidative stress. (A, B, C, D) Percent survival of indicated worm strains treated with 4 mM or 100 mM PQ. See also Tables S2 and S3. (E) Western blot analysis of pAAK-2 (Thr234) protein levels in indicated worm strains. Levels were normalized to Tubulin. (F) Fold change in pAAK-2 levels in flcn-1(ok975);par-4(it57) and par-4(it57) animals. Data represent the means ± SEM, n≥3. Based on these results, we anticipated that loss of flcn-1 might lead to a constitutive activation of AAK-2 since the observed flcn-1 loss of function phenotype is similar to the reported AAK-2 overexpression in terms of oxidative stress resistance [49], [52]. Although we did not observe an increased abundance of phospho-AAK-2 at residue Thr234 (corresponding to Thr172 in human AMPKα) in flcn-1(ok975) animals compared to wild-type, our data demonstrate a significant increase in phospho-AAK-2 levels in flcn-1(ok975); par-4(it57) double mutants compared to par-4(it57) animals (Figure 2E and 2F). This is consistent with the observation that par-4 is not fully required for the stress resistance phenotype (Figure 2D and Table S3). To exclude the possibility that the increased phosphorylation of AAK-2 is due to a flcn-1-dependent increase in total AAK levels, we measured the mRNA expression of aak-1 and aak-2 in wild-type and flcn-1(ok975) animals and did not observe a significant difference (Figure S1B). Interestingly, the residues flanking the mammalian AMPKα (Thr172) are conserved in AAK-2 (Thr234), but are different in AAK-1 and therefore, AAK-1 is unlikely to be detected by the antibody used (Figures 2E, lane 5). The increased phosphorylation of AAK-2 only in par-4(it57) mutants can be explained by the fact that PAR-4 is the major kinase that phosphorylates AAK-2 in certain tissues of the animal or cellular sub-compartments, which would mask the FLCN-dependent phosphorylation signal on AAK-2 induced by other upstream kinases [54]. Taken together, these results imply that flcn-1 negatively regulates aak-2 in C. elegans, and that loss of flcn-1 confers an aak-2-dependent resistance to oxidative stress.Resistance to oxidative stress in the absence of flcn-1 is not dependent on classical ROS detoxification pathways The insulin/IGF-1-like (DAF-2)/FOXO3a (DAF-16) and target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathways are known to control lifespan and stress response in C. elegans and other organisms and have been linked to AMPK signaling [50], [52], [59], [60], [61]. While daf-2(e1370) mutants exhibited an increased survival to PQ compared to wild-type animals, the flcn-1 mutation further increased the resistance of daf-2(e1370) animals (Figure S2A and Table S3). Consistently, daf-16(mu86) slightly reduced but did not suppress the resistance of the flcn-1(ok975) animals to PQ (Figure S2B and Table S3). Moreover, we found that the PQ resistance of the flcn-1(ok975) animals treated with TOR (let-363) RNAi was significantly higher than wild-type animals fed with the same RNAi (Table S3). Transcriptional upregulation of ROS detoxification enzymes prior to stress could explain the increased survival of flcn-1(ok975) [62]. We did not observe a significant increase in the gene expression of superoxide dismutases (sod-1, sod-2, sod-3, sod-4, and sod-5) or catalases (ctl-1, ctl-2, and ctl-3), in flcn-1(ok975) mutants when compared to wild-type (Figure S2C). Furthermore, we quantified the oxidative damage to protein and DNA. Levels of protein carbonylation and DNA damage were equal in both wild-type and flcn-1(ok975) animals under basal conditions and were similarly induced after PQ treatment (Figures S2D and S2E). Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased survival of flcn-1(ok975) mutant to PQ may not be dependent on classical oxidative stress resistance mechanisms. A likely mechanism of survival upon loss of flcn-1 on PQ might involve inhibition of apoptosis.Increased autophagy upon loss of flcn-1 confers resistance to oxidative stress Autophagy has been shown to mediate resistance to oxidative stress across evolution without a clear mechanistic explanation [63]. To investigate whether the increased oxidative stress resistance of flcn-1(ok975) mutants was due to autophagy, we measured autophagy levels using several methods. Using electron microscopy, we noticed the frequent appearance of autophagic vacuoles (Figure 3B) in flcn-1(ok975) mutants at the basal level compared to wild-type animals which increased under PQ treatment (Figures 3A and 3C). To confirm this result, we used a reporter strain that carries the integrated transgene expressing GFP::LGG-1 (LC3 ortholog). LC3 localizes to pre-autophagosomal and autophagosomal membranes, and GFP-positive puncta are thought to represent autophagosomal structures in this strain [64], [65], [66]. To exclude effects on the transgene expression, we determined the mRNA levels of LGG-1 in wild-type and flcn-1(ok975) animals and in the GFP::LGG-1 and flcn-1; GFP:: LGG-1 transgenic lines. In both cases, the transcript levels of LGG-1 were not significantly different between wild-type and flcn-1(ok975) animals demonstrating equal expression (Figures S3A and S3B). Importantly, we observed a significant increase in the number of GFP-LGG-1 positive puncta in flcn-1(ok975) mutants compared to wild-type animals under basal conditions (Figure 3D). Consistently, treatment of GFP::LGG-1 animals with flcn-1 RNAi increased the number of GFP-LGG-1 puncta (Figure 3D). Previous studies in yeast, C. elegans, and mammalian cells have demonstrated that LGG-1-II (or LC3-II) is degraded inside the autolysosomes, and that the GFP fragment is resistant to degradation and accumulates when autophagy is induced [67], [68], [69], [70]. Therefore, we performed western blot analysis on wild-type and flcn-1 protein extracts to assess the level and cleavage of GFP-LGG-1. Importantly, western blot analysis showed that both cleaved LGG-1-II and released GFP were increased in flcn-1(ok975) mutants, indicating higher autophagic activity (Figure 3E).10.1371/journal.pgen.1004273.g003Figure 3Loss of flcn-1 activates autophagy resulting in oxidative stress resistance in C. elegans.

Data represent the means ± SEM, n≥3. Also see Tables S2 and S3. AMPK has recently been shown to directly induce autophagy in mammals via phosphorylation of autophagy proteins including ULK-1, VPS-34 and BEC-1 [46], [47], [48]. Moreover, loss of aak-2 reduced autophagy in daf-2 mutant animals, while aak-2 overexpression induced autophagy [46]. Based on these results, we questioned whether the increased autophagy in flcn-1(ok975) animals depends on aak-2. Importantly, RNAi treatment against aak-2 significantly reduced the number of puncta in flcn-1(ok975) mutants, demonstrating an aak-2-dependent mechanism (Figure 3D). Inhibition of autophagy genes in C. elegans reduced survival to certain stresses such as anoxia, starvation and pathogens [66], [71], [72]. However, the requirement of autophagy genes in resistance to oxidative stress was not previously reported. We aimed to determine whether the increased survival of flcn-1(ok975) animals to oxidative stress was dependent on autophagy. Strikingly, inhibition of the essential authophagy genes atg-7 and bec-1 using RNAi markedly abolished the resistance of flcn-1(ok975) to PQ (Figures 3F–3I and Tables S2 and S3). Taken together, these results demonstrate that loss of flcn-1 induces autophagy, which is required for flcn-1-mediated stress resistance.Autophagy increases energy levels upon loss of flcn-1 Autophagy is a process that generates catabolic substrates for mitochondrial ATP production and allows cellular macromolecules to be recycled. Since we did not observe a difference in oxidative damage between wild-type and flcn-1(ok975) mutant, and since PQ is known to severely decrease ATP levels by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation [73], [74], [75], we wondered if flcn-1 is mediating an increased resistance to energy stress by employing autophagy as a source of energy. To test this hypothesis, we measured ATP levels prior and after 13 hours of 10 mM PQ treatment. Strikingly, we found that flcn-1 mutant animals have higher levels of ATP before PQ treatment compared to wild-type (Figure 4A). As expected, PQ treatment decreased the ATP levels in both wild-type and flcn-1, yet ATP levels in flcn-1(ok975) nematodes remained higher than wild-type. Importantly, flcn-1(ok975) mutants treated with PQ exhibited equal amounts of ATP when compared to the non-treated wild-type animals (Figure 4A). To test if the increased energy in flcn-1(ok975) mutants is dependent on autophagy, we treated the wild-type and flcn-1 nematodes with atg-7 RNAi and measured ATP levels. Strikingly, downregulation of autophagy completely suppressed the increased ATP levels in flcn-1(ok975) mutants in presence or absence of PQ (Figure 4A).10.1371/journal.pgen.1004273.g004Figure 4Loss of FLCN stimulates cellular energy production and resistance to energy stress. (A) Relative ATP levels measured in the indicated worm strains treated with or without PQ. (B) Percent survival of wild-type and flcn-1(ok975) nematodes upon heat stress (35°C). (C) Recovery rate of wild-type and flcn-1(ok975) strains after 26 hours anoxic injury. See Tables S4 and S5. Data represent the mean ± SEM, n≥3. To further confirm that loss of flcn-1 confers resistance to low energy levels, we measured the resistance of wild-type and flcn-1(ok975) nematodes to heat stress and anoxia, both of which are known to result in a strong depletion of energy [76]. Accordingly, when exposed to 35°C, the mean survival of flcn-1(ok975) animals was significantly higher compared to wild-type (Figure 4B and Table S4). In addition, the recovery rates after a 26 hours anoxic injury were faster in flcn-1(ok975) compared to wild-type (Figure 4C and Table S5). In conclusion, our data describe a novel mechanism for AAK-2-dependent resistance to oxidative stress, which depends on maintenance of energy homeostasis via autophagy.Loss of flcn protects against cell death and increases survival to stress The interplay between autophagy and apoptosis determines the decision between life and death which is very important for the genetic integrity of the cell [77]. The activation of autophagy has been shown to protect against cell death in C. elegans and mammals [72], [77], [78], [79]. To see whether flcn-1 controls apoptosis in animals, we determined the number of apoptotic cell corpses in the gonad arms of wild-type and flcn-1 animals upon PQ treatment. As expected, we found that PQ treatment significantly increased the number of apoptotic corpses in wild-type animals (Figure S4A). However, the increase in flcn-1 was much lower suggesting that loss of flcn-1 protects against cell death. To determine whether the decreased cell death in flcn-1 nematodes depends on the activation of autophagy, we pretreated the wild-type and flcn-1(ok975) nematodes with atg-7 RNAi and then measured the number of apoptotic corpses upon PQ treatment. Importantly, the inhibition of the autophagy gene atg-7 increased the number of apoptotic corpses, up to the same level, in both wild-type and flcn-1 suggesting that the FLCN-1-dependent activation of autophagy protects against cell death (Figure S4A). Importantly, the apoptotic pathway is conserved from animals to mammals. When cells are destined to die, the BH3 only protein EGL-1 binds and inhibits the BCL-2 homolog CED-9, which activates the caspase CED-3 and leads to death [80]. Therefore, we treated wild-type and flcn-1(ok975) animals with egl-1 and ced-3 RNAi and assessed their survival to 100 mM PQ. Importantly, downregulation of egl-1 or ced-3 using RNAi increased the resistance of wild-type animals which was not observed in flcn-1(ok975 animals suggesting that the inhibition of the apoptotic pathway leads to the increased resistance (Figures S4B–S4D and Table S3). Consistently, treatment of wild-type and flcn-1(ok975) animals with ced-9 RNAi abolished the survival of flcn-1 animals (Figure S4 and Table S3). Importantly treatment of aak-2(ok524) animals with ced-3 RNAi did not increase their resistance to PQ suggesting that this phenotype depends on AAK-2 (Table S3). The increased stress response by inhibition of apoptosis has been recently reported [81]. Although it is not clear whether the apoptosis inhibition in the gonad arms delays organismal death in C. elegans or whether apoptotic genes acquire non-apoptotic functions, our data suggest an AMPK-dependent involvement of the apoptotic pathway in the increased survival of flcn-1 animals to PQ stress (Table S3).The FLCN-dependent regulation of AMPK, autophagy, apoptosis, and metabolic stress survival is evolutionarily conserved To test whether the FLCN functions that we identified in C. elegans are evolutionarily conserved, we used wild-type (Flcn+/+) and knockout (Flcn−/−) MEFs. First, we examined the cellular resistance to serum starvation (-FBS), which reduces energy levels and induces oxidative stress in a physiological manner (Figure 5A) [58]. Flcn−/− MEFs were unaffected by serum starvation, as demonstrated by a significant maintenance of cell survival after 4 days of serum starvation, which eliminated almost 80% of wild-type cells. Rescue of wild-type FLCN expression (resc.) reverted this protective phenotype (Figure 5A). Consistent with these data, Flcn−/− MEFs were more resistant to 2 mM H2O2 treatment compared to wild-type (Figure S5A).10.1371/journal.pgen.1004273.g005Figure 5The FLCN-dependent regulation of AMPK, autophagy, and metabolic stress survival is evolutionarily conserved.

(F) Percent survival of indicated cell lines upon serum starvation, treated with or without 10 µM CQ. Data represent the mean ± SEM, n≥3. (G) Relative ATP levels measured in the indicated MEFs lines, pre-treated with or without 10 µM CQ prior to serum starvation. (H) Graphical model that summarizes findings of this study. Moreover, in accordance with the C. elegans results, phospho-AMPK levels were increased upon loss of Flcn in MEFs, which could be rescued by expression of wild-type Flcn, suggesting that FLCN acts a negative upstream regulator of AMPK (Figures 5B and S2B). Additionally, down regulation of Flcn by shRNA in MEFs lacking AMPKα (Ampk−/−) did not increase resistance to serum starvation suggesting that the increased resistance to starvation-induced stress depends on AMPK (Figures 5C and S5B). Next, we asked whether the AMPK activation in Flcn−/− MEFs could be further activated. Importantly, phosphorylation levels of AMPK and its target ACC were maximal in Flcn−/− cells and did not further increase upon serum starvation (Figure S5C). Similarly, treatment with AICAR (5-amino-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide), an AMP analogue, increased AMPK activation in wild-type as marked by elevated pACC levels but not in Flcn−/−MEFs (Figure S5C). These results demonstrate that loss of FLCN leads to maximal AMPK activation, which appears uncoupled from its energy sensing function. Moreover, we wondered whether loss of FLCN also increases autophagy in MEFs similarly to the results obtained in C. elegans. Importantly, Flcn−/− MEFs displayed an increased number of autophagosomes at the basal level and under serum starvation conditions when compared to wild-type cells as determined by the GFP-LC3 reporter (Figures 5D and 5E). To validate these results, we used a GFP-mCherry/LC3 reporter [82]. Upon physiological pH in newly formed autophagosomes or when autophagy is impaired, both GFP and mCherry colocalize in puncta whereas upon lysosomal fusion and acidification, the GFP signal is lost and only mCherry is detected. As expected, the number of mCherry puncta was increased in Flcn−/− MEFs, pointing to a normal lysosomal acidification and completion of autophagy (Figure S6A). In addition, chloroquine (CQ) treatment, which inhibits the acidification of autolysosomes, further increased the number of autophagosomes in Flcn−/− MEFs suggesting that the autophagy process is not impaired (Figures 5E and S6A). We also measured the rate of conversion of LC3I to LC3II by western blot analysis. The ratio of LC3II to LC3I was increased in Flcn−/− MEFs at the basal level and was reverted by FLCN rescue (Figure S6B). In agreement with the heightened autophagy, we observed an increase in the activating AMPK-dependent phosphorylation site at the autophagy initiating kinase ULK1 (Figure S5C). To determine whether the increased resistance to serum starvation was due to increased autophagy as we observed in C. elegans, we inhibited autophagy using CQ or Bec-1 shRNA. Inhibition of autophagy strongly suppressed the survival advantage upon serum starvation in Flcn−/− MEFs (Figures 5F and S6C). Finally, we measured apoptosis in response to serum starvation and inhibition of autophagy in MEFs (Figure S7D). Apoptosis was strongly increased in wild-type MEFs and suppressed in Flcn−/− MEFs upon serum starvation. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy using CQ abolished the suppression of apoptosis in Flcn−/− MEFs. In conclusion, these results correspond well with the data we obtained in C. elegans. Next, we determined whether the chronic activation of autophagy is leading to an energy surplus, which is required for the stress resistance phenotype conferred by loss of FLCN. Similarly to what we found in C. elegans, Flcn−/− MEFs displayed increased ATP levels under basal conditions (Figure 5G). Serum starvation decreased ATP levels in wild-type MEFs, while Flcn−/− MEFs maintained ATP levels at wild-type levels (Figure 5G). Importantly, inhibition of autophagy with CQ abolished the increase in ATP in Flcn−/− MEFs (Figure 5G). The ATP, ADP, and AMP levels as well as phospho-creatine, a short term energy reserve, were all increased at the basal level in Flcn−/− cells as compared to wild-type, suggesting a general increase in cellular metabolism and energy storage (Figures S7A and S7C). Importantly, serum starvation decreased energy levels in Flcn−/− cells down to wild-type basal levels (Figures S7A and S7C). Normally, AMPK is activated upon energy deprivation (increased ADP/ATP and AMP/ATP ratios), which is inconsistent with the increased basal ATP levels conferred by loss of FLCN [40], [42]. To understand this discrepancy, we determined the adenylate energy charge of wild-type and Flcn−/− MEFs. The adenylate energy charge, which is expressed by the ratio [ATP] + 0.5[ADP]/[ATP]+[ADP]+[AMP], was proposed as a convenient indicator of the cellular energy status [83]. Under normal conditions, ATP levels were increased in Flcn−/− MEFs but the total energy charge was comparable to wild-type (Figure S7B). However, serum starvation significantly reduced the energy charge in wild-type MEFs but not in Flcn−/− MEFs, suggesting that Flcn−/− cells derive their energy from an intracellular source of ATP [83] (Figure S7B). To determine whether loss of FLCN in human cancer cells also conferred an advantage in energy homeostasis, we used the follicular thyroid carcinoma cells FTC-133 lacking FLCN expression, which we rescued for FLCN using stable transfection. First, we confirmed the findings that we obtained with wild-type and Flcn−/− MEFs. As expected, loss of FLCN conferred an increased phosphorylation of AMPK as well as a higher LC3 cleavage demonstrating that AMPK activation and autophagy in FLCN-deficient FTC cells is elevated compared to rescued cells (Figure S8A). Next, we aimed to determine whether the increased autophagy promoted by loss of FLCN heightens ATP levels at normal conditions in FTC cells. Similarly to what we observed in MEFs, loss of FLCN requires autophagy to increase ATP levels (Figure S8B). To determine whether autophagy contributes to anchorage-independent growth conferred by loss of FLCN, we performed soft agar assays in the presence or absence of autophagy inhibition using atg7 shRNAs. As expected, loss FLCN significantly increased the number of colonies growing in soft agar in an autophagy-dependent manner (Figures S8C and S8D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that loss of FLCN leads to an autophagy-dependent increase in ATP levels enabling FLCN-deficient animals/cells to resist metabolic stresses, which could constitute a tumor suppression mechanism.Discussion Maintenance of cellular bioenergetics and management of oxidative stress are essential for life. Here we highlight the discovery of an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway mediated by the tumor suppressor FLCN and AMPK that is essential for resistance to metabolic stress. Loss of FLCN in C. elegans and mammalian cells leads to constitutive activation of AAK/AMPK, which in turn increases autophagy. Chronic activation of autophagy leads to increased ATP production and confers resistance to energy depleting stresses by inhibition of apoptosis. Together, our data identify FLCN as a key regulator of stress resistance and metabolism through negative regulation of AMPK. Several questions arise from these results. First, how is AAK-2 being activated in flcn-1(ok975) animals upon loss of PAR-4? Several upstream AMPK kinases other than LKB1 have been identified in mammalian cells, have been shown to affect AMPK activity [40]. Although these kinases have not been linked to AAK-2 in C. elegans, our data showed a significant basal phosphorylation of AAK-2 in par-4(it57) mutant animals. This is in agreement with a recently published study showing that starvation and mitochondrial poisons increased phospho-AAK-2 levels in par-4(it57) mutant animals, and that the starvation-induced aak-2 phenotypes were partially dependent on PAR-4 [84]. The fact that the AMPK signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved suggests that AMPK upstream kinases other than PAR-4 are likely to exist in C. elegans. For instance, Pak1/Camkk-beta was first identified in yeast as Snf-1/AMPK-activating kinase and was proven later to act upstream of AMPK in mammalian systems [85], [86], [87]. Very recently, CAMKII overexpression was shown to increase lifespan in C. elegans, although the link to AAK-2 was not investigated [88].Together, our data demonstrate that FLCN-1-dependent regulation of AAK-2 mediates an important novel pathway for stress resistance. Interestingly, this pathway is distinct from previously described AAK-2-mediated oxidative stress resistance mechanisms that involve ROS detoxification [51], [52], [89]. Another unexpected finding is that loss of flcn-1 did not modulate C. elegans longevity under normal growth conditions. The observed increased AAK-2 activation upon loss of flcn-1 is masked by PAR-4-dependent phosphorylation of AAK-2. General overexpression of AMPK extends lifespan and increase stress resistance [46], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [56], [90]. Our data suggest that the signaling cascade downstream of FLCN-1/AAK-2 is different from the AAK-2 responses that modulate longevity. It is possible that the PAR-4-dependent activation of AAK-2 extends lifespan and increases stress resistance, while the AAK-2 activation by other upstream kinases only increases resistance to stress. Another possibility would be that a tissue-specific or sub-cellular AAK-2 activation might lead to different outcomes. Importantly, our data indicate that loss of FLCN-1 extends lifespan only upon treatment with high concentrations (100 uM) of the DNA synthesis inhibitor 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FUDR) (Figure S9F and Table S1), a phenotype that has been recently reported by Gharbi et al. [91]. This drug is frequently used in C. elegans aging studies to prevent eggs from hatching and has been recently reported to “artifactually” affect lifespan in mitochondrial C. elegans mutants and modulate metabolism in the daf-2 mutant strain [92], [93], [94]. It is not clear why flcn-1(ok975) animals exhibit an extension of lifespan only upon treatment with FUDR and what would be the potential mechanism of FUDR action. FUDR may act as metabolic stressor especially that high FUDR concentrations above 100 uM seem to be required to observe the effect on lifespan in flcn-1(ok975) animals (Figure S9). Interestingly, lower concentrations of FUDR (5–10 uM) that are also sufficient to inhibit germ line proliferation had no effect on lifespan. Here we show that the enhanced resistance to oxidative stress in the absence of FLCN-1 does not result from a decrease in oxidative damage or an increased transcriptional upregulation of ROS-detoxifying enzymes [51], [52], [89]. Instead, we show that loss of FLCN-1 activates AAK-2 thereby inducing autophagy. Accordingly, downregulation of unc-51, the ortholog of the autophagy kinase ULK1, was shown to suppress the increased number of positive GFP::LGG-1 foci upon overexpression of the kinase domain of AAK-2 in C. elegans [46]. More evidence was gathered in mammalian systems to support the direct activation of autophagy by AMPK [46], [47], [48]. In addition, we show that autophagy is required for the increased ATP in flcn-1(ok975) animals and Flcn−/− MEFs suggesting that the chronic activation of autophagy in the absence of FLCN recycles building blocks to produce ATP promoting stress resistance. When energy levels drop in the cell, AMP or ADP bind to the γ regulatory subunit of AMPK and induce an allosteric conformational change [43], [44], which leads to AMPK activation through phosphorylation of Thr172 in the catalytic subunit via inhibition of dephosphorylation activities. It is striking that loss of FLCN induces AMPK and autophagy in flcn-1(ok975) mutant animals and Flcn−/− MEFs, which exhibit high energy levels. These observations suggest that FLCN might be involved in the control of the energy sensing ability of AMPK. The increased activation of AMPK despite high energy levels has been recently reported upon inhibition of two other inhibitors of AMPK activity [95], [96]. The roles of AMPK and autophagy in cancer are puzzling [97], [98], [99], [100]. Both AMPK activation and autophagy have been shown to acquire anti- and pro-tumor functions [97], [98], [99], [100]. Our results imply that the AMPK-dependent activation of autophagy might be essential for FLCN-deficient tumor cells to acquire an energetic advantage and drive tumorigenesis. In analogy with our results, autophagy was recently shown to be required for tumor growth in many cancer models [101], [102], [103]. A similar role for VHL, another renal tumor suppressor, in the regulation of autophagic events in renal cell carcinomas has been recently described [104]. In fact, the inhibition of autophagy by MiR-204 suppressed the tumor growth in VHL-deficient cells [104]. Moreover, the LC3B/ATG5-dependent autophagy was shown to be required for the development of VHL-deficient renal cell carcinomas in nude mice [104]. We suggest that the AMPK-dependent autophagy activation upon loss of FLCN promotes the survival of transformed cells, which normally undergo severe metabolic stresses as caused by hypoxia and lack of blood vessels [105]. In agreement with our results, four groups have recently reported that AMPK activation drives tumorigenesis via metabolic stress adaptation of different tumors [99], [106], [107], [108]. In fact, AMPK is the best-characterized target of the tumor suppressor LKB1 and it was shown recently that loss of LKB-1/AMPK had a positive effect on tumor initiation but a negative effect on tumor progression/dissemination [98], [109]. The fact that FLCN negatively regulates AMPK strongly implicates that it exerts physiological functions other than being a tumor suppressor. In the past ten years, FLCN was reported to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis, rRNA synthesis, TGF-β signaling, B-cell and stem cell differentiation, ciliogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, TOR signaling, epithelial polarization, and cytokinesis without the elucidation of the molecular mechanism [24], [25], [26], [31], [33], [35], [39], [110], [111], [112], [113]. While this report was under review, two reports have shown that loss of folliculin leads to mTOR inhibition and that it is involved in nutrient sensing via acting as a GTPase activating enzyme for the RAG GTPases [114], [115]. It is possible that FLCN acts in two complexes. It binds to RAGs under starvation conditions leading to mTOR inhibition, while in normal conditions FLCN would bind AMPK, inhibiting its activity. However, it is not clear how the reported inhibition of mTOR activity upon loss of FLCN could lead to tumorigenesis, since mTOR was shown to be hyper-activated in tumors of BHD patients and mice devoid of FLCN [25]. In conclusion, we used the model organism C. elegans to decipher a genetic pathway, which is regulated by FLCN. We show that FLCN negatively regulates the activity of AMPK, which leads to increased autophagy, energy and survival to metabolic stress. Moreover, we confirmed conservation of this pathway in mammalian cells and suggest that chronic AMPK activation upon loss of FLCN potentiates tumorigenesis via increased autophagy leading to metabolic stress resistance and inhibition of apoptosis, which are two hallmarks of cancer cells [116].Materials and MethodsAntibodies, reagents and plasmids The FLCN-1 nematode polyclonal antibody was generated in rabbits with a purified GST-FLCN-1 recombinant protein by the McGill animal resource center services. Commercial antibodies and reagents used in this study are listed in Text S1.C. elegans strains, maintenance, RNAi and lifespan assays C. elegans strains were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (see Table S6). The flcn-1(ok975) strain was outcrossed eight times to wild-type. Nematodes were maintained and synchronized using standard culture methods [117]. The RNAi feeding experiments were performed as described in [118], and bacteria transformed with empty vector were used as control. For all RNAi experiments, phenotypes were scored with the F1 generation except for aak-2 knockdown (F2). Lifespan assays were performed according to standard protocols [119].Transgenic strain construction Expression constructs were generated using the pPD95.77 vector. pRF4 rol-6(su1006) was used as a co-injector marker. Transgenic lines were generated by microinjection into the gonad of adult hermaphrodite using standard techniques. 2.8 kb endogenous promoter of flcn-1 was generated by PCR from wild-type genomic DNA (Forward primer 5′AAAACTGCAGCGTCTTCTCGTTTCACAGTAGTCA-3′ and reverse primer: 5′GCTCTAGATTGAATTCTGTAAAAACATGAATTTGA-3′) and cloned into pPD 95.77 at PstI and XbaI sites. flcn-1 cDNA was obtained from an RT–PCR reaction performed on wild-type animals RNA extracts using the following: forward primer 5′GCTCTAGAATGCAAGCAGTAATAGCACTTTGT-3′ and Reverse primer 5′CGGGATCCACGAGCAGTAGAGGTTTGAGACTG-3′. flcn-1 cDNA was subsequently cloned into pPD 95.77 (GFP expression plasmid-with flcn-1 endogenous promoter region) at XbaI and BamHI sites.Cell culture Primary MEFs were isolated from C57BL/6 E12.5 Flcn floxed mice. Ampk+/+ and Ampk−/− MEFs were described in [93]. Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For details on shRNA procedures, transfections, FLCN deletions and immortalization see supporting information.Stress resistance assays Resistance to acute oxidative stress (100 mM PQ and H2O2) was determined as described in [52], [54]. Chronic oxidative stress was assessed on thirty post-fertile animals using 4 mM PQ and survival was measured daily. For heat stress, one-day adult animals were transferred to NGM plates and exposed to 35°C. Survival was measured at indicated time points until all animals died. Concerning anoxia stress, one-day old adult animals were transferred to NGM plates and left in a Bio-Bag Environmental Chamber Type A (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) for 26 hours at 20°C. Recovery rates were scored at indicated time points. For MEFs, cells were seeded (2×104 cells) in 12-well plates and FBS-free media was added 24 hours after plating. Cell numbers were counted daily and survival rates were determined as the percent cell number compared to day 0.Autophagy analysis by fluorescent microscope For C. elegans, autophagy levels were assessed in hypodermal seam cells of L3 animals using the GFP::LGG-1 transgenic reporter strain DA2123 (See Table S6). For MEFs, wild-type and Flcn−/− cells were infected with the pMigR-1-LC3-GFP or the mcherry/GFP-LC3 constructs [82], seeded on coverslip (50000 cells in 6 well-plate), serum starved for 12 hours and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Autophagic-GFP positive puncta were quantified in at least 200 cells. Pictures from nematodes and MEFs were acquired with a Zeiss fluorescence confocal microscope.Determination of ATP content For C. elegans, synchronized young adults were collected and washed in M9 buffer. Pellets were treated with three freeze/thaw cycles and boiled for 15 min. ATP content in C. elegans was measured using an ATP determination kit (Invitrogen) and in MEFs using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). For C. elegans, levels were normalized to protein levels and in MEFs normalized to cell number.DNA and protein oxidative damage assays Genomic DNAs from worm pellets were purified using Phenol/Chloroform extraction and treated with RNase A for 1 hour at 37°C. OxiSelect oxidative DNA damage ELISA assay was performed with 8 µg of DNA following manufacturer's instructions (Cell Biolabs). Protein oxidative damage was assessed using Oxyblot Protein Oxidation Detection Kit (Millipore).RNA extraction and real-time PCR Synchronized young adult nematodes were harvested and total RNA was extracted with Trizol, purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using Express SYBR Green qPCR supermix (Invitrogen) and LightCycler480 system (Roche). Catalase and SOD transcripts were normalized to housekeeping genes cdc42, pmp-3, and Y45F10D.4 using Genorm [120]. AAK transcripts were normalized against cdc-42. For primer sequences see Table S7.Protein extraction and western blotting Cells and synchronized young adult nematodes were washed with ice-cold PBS and M9 respectively and lysed in the AMPK lysis buffer [121] supplemented with the complete protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche), 1 mM DTT, and benzamidine 1 µg/ml. Worm pellets were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. Percent pAAK-2/pAMPK levels were quantified using ImageJ software and normalized for the AMPK levels.Transmission electron microscopy Synchronized young adult nematodes were treated with 50 mM PQ/M9 or M9 alone for 2 hours, washed and plated on NGM plates allowing 30 minutes recovery. TEM immersion fixation and embedding was performed according to [122]. See Text S1.Soft agar assay FTC cells were trypsinized, counted and resuspended in complete DMEM/F12 media. Two layered soft agar assay were undertaken in six well plates. The bottom layer contains 0.6% agar in complete DMEM/F12 media. The second layer encompasses 0.3% agar mixed with 0.5 million cells. Plates were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2.Apoptosis assay For worms, apoptotic germ cell corpses were visualized using Acridine Orange (AO) as described in [123]. Worms were incubated for 2 hours in M9 with or without 50 mM PQ in OP50, supplemented with 2 µl/ml AO (stock of 10 mg/ml). Worms were then washed and transferred into light-protected recovery NGM plates for 45 min before visualization. In MEFs, apoptosis levels were determined using the Annexin V: PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Fluorescence intensity corresponding to apoptosis levels was detected using FACSCalibur flow cytometer (excitation 488; emission 575/26; BD Biosciences).LC-MS/MS analysis Targeted metabolite analysis was performed on an Agilent 6430 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a 1290 Infinity UPLC system (Agilent Technologies). Metabolites were separated using a 4.0 µm, 2.1×100 mm Cogent Diamond Hydride column (MicroSolv Technology Corporation). Quantification was accomplished using MassHunter Quantitative Analysis software (Agilent). See Text S1 for details.Statistical analyses Data are expressed as means ±SEM. Statistical analyses for all data were performed by unpaired student's t-test, ANOVA, using Excel (Microsoft, Albuquerque, NM, USA), SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and prism software (GraphPad).

Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is the most common hair loss disorder in women. Initial signs may develop during teenage years leading to a progressive hair loss with a characteristic pattern distribution. The condition is characterized by progressive replacement of terminal hair follicles over the frontal and vertex regions by miniaturized follicles, that leads progressively to a visible reduction in hair density. Women diagnosed with FPHL may undergo significant impairment of quality of life. FPHL diagnosis is mostly clinical. Depending on patient history and clinical evaluation, further diagnostic testing may be useful. The purpose of the paper is to review the current knowledge about epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of FPHL. 1. Definition of FPHL The FPHL is a nonscarring progressive thinning of hair. It results from a progressive decrease in the ratio of terminal hairs to shorter, thinner vellus hairs, a process known as follicular miniaturization [1]. This miniaturization follows usually a pattern distribution. In women, FPHL typically presents as a diffuse reduction in hair density over the frontal and vertex areas, but parietal and occipital regions may be involved [2].2. Terminology In the past, the term “androgenetic alopecia” (AGA) was the primary term used to refer to this condition in both men and women. The term “andro” from ancient Greek refers to male subjects and “genetic” referred to the contribution of heredity. Over the years, “female pattern hair loss” became the preferred term for this form of hair loss. This terminology helps to distinguish the different features of the condition in women versus men and shows the lack of clear hormonal contribution in many cases. Further, some authors use the terms “androgen-dependent FPHL” and “androgen-independent FPHL” to separate women who have FPHL due to androgen excess from those with normal androgen levels [3].3. Epidemiology FPHL is very common and increases with age in the Caucasian women populations. In 2001, Norwood established the prevalence of FPHL at 19 percent in a series of approximately 1000 Caucasian women [4]. Although FPHL can occur at any time of life, the condition occurs the most following menopause. This age-related rise was clearly established in Norwood's series; FPHL was only detected in 4 of 121 women between the ages of 20 and 29 (3 percent), but in 41 of 140 women between the ages of 70 and 89 (29 percent) [4]. In a British study of 377 women, 38 percent of women over the age of 70 years had FPHL [5]. The prevalence of the condition seems to be lower in the Asian population [6, 7]. A Korean study shows that the prevalence of FPHL in Korean women at all ages was only 5.6%. Like in Caucasian women, this prevalence increases steadily with advancing age [7]. There are no published data over the prevalence of FPHL in African women.4. Etiology and Pathogenesis The visible thinning of hair of the scalp in FPHL results from a progressive decrease in the ratio of terminal hairs to shorter vellus hairs, a process called follicular miniaturization [8]. The mechanism through which this follicular transformation occurs in FPHL is not completely understood. Although the roles of androgens and genetic susceptibility in male AGA are well accepted, the degree to which these factors contribute to FPHL is less clear.4.1. Androgens The androgens role in common male baldness was first suspected by Hamilton in 1942. He notes that AGA does not occur in men who have never entered puberty, that baldness stops its progression in castrated men, and that testosterone replacements stimulate progressive balding [9]. In recent studies, AGA is described as a consequence of the direct effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the dermal papilla of susceptible hair follicles [10]. DHT is a more potent androgen, coming from the metabolism of testosterone by the action of the 5α-reductase. DHT binds to androgen receptors in hair follicles, more strongly even than testosterone, resulting in upregulation of genes responsible for the gradual transformation of terminal hair follicles to miniaturized hair follicles (Figure 1) [11]. These miniaturized hairs of various lengths and diameters are the hallmark of FPHL and AGA [10, 12, 13]. However, the number of follicles per unit area remains the same [14]. The pattern of hair loss, which typically spares the occipital scalp, reflects regional differences in the sensitivity of scalp follicles to androgens. Some authors have theorized that a similar process contributes to the development of FPHL, a concept supported by the observation that women with hyperandrogenism may develop early-onset FPHL [2]. However, most women with FPHL have no other signs or symptoms of hyperandrogenism and have normal androgen levels, indicating that our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disorder remains incomplete. The age-related increase in FPHL and the highest rates in postmenopausal women may suggest a protective role of the estrogen. Supporting this theory, Sawaya and Price conducted a study in 12 young women and 12 young men (ages from 14 to 33) suffering from AGA or FPHL [15]. Scalp biopsies were taken and androgens, expression of androgen receptor, type I and type II 5α-reductase, and cytochrome p-450 aromatase enzyme genes were measured in hair follicles. Both young women and young men had higher levels of type I and type II 5α-reductase and androgen receptors in frontal hair follicles compared to occipital hair follicles explaining probably the patterned hair loss. However, the levels in women were approximately half the levels in men [15]. The findings of this study suggest that the milder expression of FPHL may in part be the result of lower levels of 5α-reductase and androgen receptors in frontal follicles of women compared to levels in men. Additionally, young women had much higher levels of cytochrome p-450 aromatase, enzyme capable of converting testosterone to estradiol, in frontal and occipital follicles than men. Those notable increased aromatase levels seem to play a protective role in the development of hair loss in women [15]. Furthermore, supporting the androgen-dependent etiopathogenesis, low levels of sex hormone-binding protein (SHBG), glycoprotein that binds to androgens, inhibiting thereby their activities, have been linked to diffuse hair loss [16]. Another part of FPHL and AGA pathogenesis is the gradual shortening of the growth phase of hair follicles. Over the successive hair cycles, the duration of anagen phase shortens from a normal duration of a few years to only weeks to months [2].4.2. Genetics There are few studies evaluating the genetic basis and inheritance pattern of FPHL [8]. One of them shows an incidence of 54% pattern hair loss in first-degree male relatives of age >30 years and 21% in first-degree female relatives >30 years. Those reports of the occurrence of both FPHL and AGA in individual families suggest that FPHL and AGA share a common genetic background [17, 18]. The two major susceptibility loci for the AGA in men are the androgen receptor (AR)/ectodysplasin A2 receptor (EDA2R) locus on the X-chromosome and a locus on chromosome 20p11, for which no candidate gene has yet been identified [19, 20]. Very recent studies show no involvement of the well-established locus on chromosome 20p11 in FPHL but suggested that the X-chromosomal locus containing the androgen receptor (AR) and the ectodysplasin A2 receptor (EDA2R) genes may be specifically involved in the pathogenesis of early-onset FPHL [21]. Moreover, an Australian genomewide association study suggested that the aromatase gene (CYP19A1) may contribute to FPHL [22].5. Clinical Features FPHL may have three different patterns [23]: diffuse thinning of the crown region with preservation of the frontal hairline: two scales are used to describe this pattern: the commonly 3-point Ludwig scale [12, 24] (Figure 2) and the 5-point Sinclair scale [25] (Figure 3); thinning and widening of the central part of the scalp with breach of frontal hairline, described by Olsen scale: Christmas tree pattern (Figure 4) [26]; thinning associated with bitemporal recession; Hamilton-Norwood scale [27]. All these common patterns spare the occipital area, a phenomenon explained probably by hormonal influences explained above. This behavior's difference between the frontal/parietal follicles and the occipital follicles is found in other hair disorders like alopecia areata, a condition where occipital follicles affected by the ophiasis pattern are typically more resistant to regrowth [28]. These differences may result from the embryological derivation of the dermis in the two regions. It is known from avian embryology that the dermis of the frontal/parietal scalp is of neural crest origin, whereas the dermis of the occipital scalp is of mesodermal origin [29].6. Associated Disorders6.1. Psychosocial Dysfunction Many women suffering from FPHL experience negative psychosocial effects related to the condition. In a questionnaire-based study, 70 percent of affected women reported that they were very to extremely upset about their hair loss. They experienced more feeling of negative image body and poorer self-esteem and had a less quality of life than the control group [30]. In another study, 88 percent of females with FPHL felt that the hair loss negatively influenced daily life [31]. Clinicians managing patients with FPHL should remain aware that the patient's perception of the severity of hair loss may be different from the clinical assessment of the severity and the psychosocial impact of the condition. In a recent questionnaire-based study of 104 women suffering from different hair loss disorders like alopecia areata, FPHL, or telogen effluvium, the patient's perception of the severity of hair loss was greater than the severity ratings given by the dermatologist. In addition, the personal rating of hair loss will be more closely correlated with the effects of hair loss on quality of life [32]. This psychosocial dysfunction related to FPHL is also experienced by adolescent girls suffering from the condition. Those teenage girls may experience poor self-esteem and impaired functioning at home, school, or work and in personal relationships [33].6.2. Medical Conditions Links between early-onset FPHL and insulin resistance and hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk have been described [34, 35]. Those conditions seem to be due to higher aldosterone, C-protein, D-dimers, and insulin levels in women suffering from FPHL than in control subjects. Authors recommend the determination of metabolic syndrome and ultrasound study of the carotid arteries to detect risk of developing cardiovascular disease in female patients with early-onset FPHL [35]. Recently, vertex pattern AGA in male patients of all ages was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer [36]. There is no evidence in the current knowledge of an association between FPHL and the risk of any kind of cancer.7. Clinical Diagnosis7.1. General History The physician should record age of onset and duration and progression of hair loss. The patients often describe a chronic hair loss with some increased periods of activity, particularly during autumn and winter. The patient should be asked about thinning and shedding. For thinning, most patients described an accentuation of the frontal, parietal, or vertex region, but a diffuse thinning is possible as well. The family history is more often positive, but a negative family history does not exclude the diagnosis. The patient should be asked about other familial hair disorders like alopecia areata or hirsutism, which may influence the further investigations. It is also important to exclude other causes of hair loss whose untreated presence could affect the efficacy of the FPHL treatment. The presence of other medical disorders and newly diagnosed diseases within one year prior to first signs of hair loss and the medical treatment should be investigated. Other causes of hair loss such as diffuse effluvium due to iron deficiency, infection, thyroid dysfunction, or chronic deficient diet should be excluded. Some drugs such as chemotherapeutic agents, proandrogenic hormones, or antithyroids may cause diffuse hair loss. Moreover, some cosmetic habits (traction) or environmental factors like smoking [37] or UV-exposition [38] may induce increased hair loss in women. The experts all agree to ask about eating behavior, as chronic deficient diet or rapid important weight loss can trigger diffuse effluvium [23].7.2. Gynecological History A complete gynecological and obstetrical interrogatory that includes menarche, menstrual cycle (regular/irregular), menopause, amenorrhea, use of oral or systemic hormonal contraception, hormone replacement therapy, fertility treatment, problems in getting pregnant, gynecological surgery, pregnancies, births, miscarriages, and signs of hyperandrogenism (excessive body hair growth, acne, ect.) should be done to exclude influencing hormonal deregulations (e.g., hormone sensitive tumor) [39]. Impaired fertility, amenorrhea, irregular menstrual cycle, and signs of hyperandrogenism and hyperseborrhea may be indicative for polycystic ovary syndrome [40].7.3. Physical Examination A full skin examination that includes body and nails is advised in women complaining of hair loss. Nails abnormalities identification is not typical in FPHL but may differentiate the condition from other cases of hair loss like alopecia areata, iron deficiencies, or lichen planus [23]. A whole body examination should be performed to find other signs of possibly associated hyperandrogenism.7.4. Scalp and Hair Scalp Examination Scalp examination should focus on identifying the distribution of hair loss and the caliber of hairs in commonly involved areas. Findings consistent with FPHL include the detection of terminal hair loss, variation of hair caliber, and miniaturized hairs. Pull test identifying increased shedding of telogen hairs is typically negative except in active phases of FPHL. The most frequently used scales are the Ludwig (Figure 2) and the Olsen (Figure 4) scales, described previously. FPHL is a nonscarring alopecia, explaining that the scalp skin appears normal, but other clinical features such as inflammation, scarring, or hyperseborrhea can be associated and potentially aggravating the FPHL [41]. The physician should also consider scarring alopecia mimicking FPHL like frontal fibrosing alopecia [42].7.5. Trichoscopy Trichoscopy or scalp dermatoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic tool, very useful for the diagnosis and followup of hair and scalp disorders [43]. Trichoscopy of FPHL is characterized by hair diameter variability greater than 20% [44] (Figure 5). Hair shaft variability can also be present in alopecia areata. However, in this pathology dermatoscopy shows uniform miniaturization instead of hair shafts with different degree of thinning. This hair diameter variability is very useful to detect early FPHL in children or teenage girls [45]. In 2009, Rakowska et al. [46] proposed major and minor dermoscopic criteria for the diagnosis of FPHL. Major criteria include (1) more than 4 yellow dots in 4 images in the frontal area; (2) lower average hair thickness in the frontal area compared with the occiput; and (3) more than 10% of thin hairs (<0.03 mm) in the frontal area. Minor criteria include (1) increased frontal to occipital ratio of single-hair pilosebaceous units; (2) vellus hairs; and (3) perifollicular discoloration. The diagnosis of FPHL is made during the presence of two major criteria or one major plus two minor criteria.7.6. Pull Test Pull test is a noninvasive diagnostic technique, very easy to perform and to repeat. Pull test is very helpful to rapidly determine the ongoing activity and severity of any kind of hair loss. Briefly, a bundle of about 50–60 hairs is grasped between the thumb, index finger, and middle finger from the base near the scalp. The hair is firmly, but not forcibly, tugged away from the scalp as fingers slide along the hair shaft [47]. The test is positive when more than 10% of the grasped hair (in average more than six hairs) can be pulled out [48]. If fewer than six hairs can be easily pulled out, this is considered normal physiologic shedding [49]. The test has a large interobserver variation and can be influenced by cosmetic habits, hair manipulation, and shampooing. Each clinician has to standardize his own procedure. The pull test should be done in all the scalp areas: right and left parietal, frontal, and occipital regions. A positive test present in more than one scalp region can be seen during a telogen effluvium. The patients suffering from FPHL may have a positive pull test only during the active phases in the affected area. A diffuse positive pull test requires always further investigation to exclude telogen effluvium [23].8. Other Diagnostic Techniques8.1. Scalp Biopsy Scalp biopsy is an essential instrument in the diagnosis of cicatricial and selected forms of noncicatricial alopecia [50]. Although scalp biopsies are usually not needed to diagnose FPHL, they can be helpful if the clinical evaluation does not provide a definitive diagnosis, for example, when scalp changes suggestive of cicatricial alopecia of diffuse alopecia areata are present. A 4 mm punch extending into the subcutaneous fat should be performed on the central scalp area. It is best to avoid the bitemporal area as this region may have miniaturized hairs in women without hair loss [23]. Scalps biopsies should be read by experienced dermatopathologists using both vertical sectioning and horizontal sectioning. Horizontal sections allow a rapid evaluation of hair follicle number, diameter, grouping, and morphology maximizing the diagnostic yield [51]. In FPHL, there are an increased number of miniaturized (vellus-like) hairs. The ratio of terminal to vellus-like hair follicles is typically >3 : 1 in women suffering from this condition against >7 : 1 in the normal scalp [14]. Other typical histopathological features are an increase of telogen : anagen ratio and an increased number of follicular stelae. A mild perifollicular inflammation around the upper portion of hair follicle as well as perifollicular fibrosis may also be seen [52].8.2. Trichogram The trichogram is a semi-invasive (plucking) microscopic method for hair root and hair cycle evaluation. The term “trichogram” was given by Pecoraro et al. in 1964, who described further trichometric parameters such as hair shaft diameter, hair growth, and telogen rate [53]. The trichogram is based on the hair cycle and quantifies hair follicles in their different growth phases: anagen, telogen, or catagen. Trichogram may be recommended in individual cases of FPHL if another diagnosis is suspected like an anagen-dysplastic effluvium or a loose anagen syndrome. Trichogram can also be useful as a complementary element that may confirm an early diagnosis of FPHL by showing inhomogeneous hair shafts. However, a recent study suggests that dermatoscopy is more useful for the diagnosis of FPHL than trichograms [54].8.3. Phototrichogram/TrichoScan Phototrichograms are automatic digitalized imaging techniques used to examine features of hair loss for diagnosis and followup [55]. A small area of the scalp is trimmed and followed with imaging. The proportion of anagen, telogen, and shed hairs as well as the rate of growth and the density can be recorded and compared [56]. The FPHL is characterized, like AGA, by a decrease in the frontal hair density compared with the occipital density. To ensure reproducibility tattoos identifying the studied area are required [48]. When available, those techniques are helpful for long-term followup and quantification, but currently they are mainly used as a tool for clinical studies [57].8.4. Laboratory Tests Ferritin and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels may be measured, especially in diffuse effluvium. The association between FPHL and low ferritin levels was suggested in two different studies [58, 59] which reported significantly lower ferritin levels in women suffering from FPHL compared with controls. More recent studies have not shown sufficient evidence of the relationship between low ferritin level and FPHL and do not recommend iron supplementation in the absence of deficiency anemia [60]. In 2008, Bregy and Trüeb even suggest no association between iron deficiency and hair loss in women [61]. The experts agreed that an extensive endocrinological investigation is not necessary in all women. Research for hyperandrogenic state will be performed in women with FPHL when the history and the clinical examination are suggesting an androgen excess (e.g., hirsutism, irregular menses, acne, and galactorrhea). Some authors speculate that the Hamilton IV pattern is more common in women suffering from ovarian hyperandrogenism, but there are no studies to corroborate or invalid this theory. The authors recommend a free androgen index test (FAI = total testosterone (nmolL−1) × 100/sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)) and prolactin as screening parameters for ovarian hyperandrogenism and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAs) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OH) as screening parameters for surrenal hyperandrogenism [23, 39, 62]. Depending on the results, further investigations may be needed and an interdisciplinary approach involving gynecologists, endocrinologists, and dermatologists may be required. Note that androgen levels testing should be done during the follicular phase, between the fourth and the seventh day of the cycle and that oral contraceptives should be discontinued for at least two months prior to this testing [63]. The patients should be informed that cessation of contraception may induce a three-month lasting telogen effluvium.9. Summary FPHL is a very common, nonscarring form of hair loss that can occur in all ages but most commonly in postmenopausal women. Although hormonal factors and genetic predisposition are believed to contribute to FPHL, the complete mechanism remains elusive and the most affected women have normal androgen levels. FPHL does not cause physical discomfort but the hair loss can contribute to significant psychological distress. Generally, the condition is clinical diagnosis, suggested by the reduction in hair density with a characteristic distribution. Depending on patient history and clinical evaluation, further diagnostic tests may be required.

Among these diagnostic tools, medical imaging is indeed one of the most representative fields that have been growing fast, used extensively, and regarded as an irreplaceable part of clinical routines. With a very different scale, “omics” refers to the study of cellular- or DNA-level molecules including their functions, structures, interactions, and involvement in disease development. Similar to imaging, the “omics” fields such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have also advanced drastically in recent decades. The “omics” data obtained from a patient reveal a much more microscaled world that allows the practitioner to see what is going on in the genomic and proteomic levels. As imaging and omics technologies look at human physiology in quite different scales, physicians and scientists are currently attempting to integrate imaging and omics data for tailored therapies and research purposes. This special issue provides original research and review on the potential role and value of imaging in the context of personalized medicine based on omics information. Imaging can be used as a tool to directly measure the omics data. As pointed out by the comprehensive review by G. Lin and Y. L. Chung on the use of molecular imaging methods to study metabolomics in this issue, recent technological advancements of parallel imaging and high-field magnets have largely propelled the advancement of metabolomics for MR spectroscopy to measure the amount and exchange of multiple metabolites. Such imaging technologies can also be applied to in vivo imaging for both small animals and humans. Imaging the living organisms allows investigators to observe the metabolism and molecular exchange in both the spatial and temporal domains. In addition to measuring the omics data with imaging, clinical oncology continues to use medical images for treatment planning. G. C. Pereira et al. have given a comprehensive review on the role and importance of imaging in radiation therapies in this special issue. In this review, the critical role of imaging in radiation therapy is reviewed for the application of dose calculation, lesion location, and delineation. The combination of omics information and the image-derived lesion information has a high potential to further enhance the treatment efficacy for oncological applications. Image quantification and information extraction remain to be a challenge for integrating imaging and omics information. In this special issue, Y.-H. D. Fang et al. described an example in the open-source software development for quantifying the intratumoral heterogeneity. Such quantification based on texture analysis has been reported to be helpful for prognosis in oncological applications. However, currently there is no free software for such quantification in the public domain. Therefore, Y.-H. D. Fang et al. developed and shared a software package to fill this void and demonstrated its usefulness in a small cohort of oral cavity cancer patients. There are also many practical limitations for medical imaging that is modality-dependent. Ionizing radiation is one major concern for CT and radionuclide imaging such as PET and SPECT. MR does not require ionizing radiation and owns a great potential in molecular imaging, but it has its own limitations in speed, cost, and potential renal toxicity with the use of Gd-based contrast agents. In this special issue, H. M. Huang and Y. Y. Shih gave a review on the recent technical advancement of dose reduction for CT and acceleration for MR. From their review, it could be optimistically expected that such practical limitations will gradually be resolved to make those two modalities more commonly used in the integration of imaging and omics research in the future. To fully exploit the omics data in personalized medicine, new advancements for instrumentation to extract omics data play a critical role. A review article by C.-S. A. Gong and K. F. Lei in this special issue will discuss the recent advancement of miniaturized devices for genomics, which may further advance the clinical popularity for gene sequencing. One of the striking examples is the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy as the electrical detection of DNA hybridization in microfluidic devices. The combination of microfluidic and impedimetric technologies shows an alternative and attractive method for detecting the genomic signal. In conclusion, the dramatic advancements of the omics knowledge have further propelled the development of personalized medicine. The original and review articles in this special issue show that there will be a significant role of medical images in the future of personalized medicine. It can be optimistically expected that imaging will continue to evolve as part of the omics data as well as serving as a tool for omics measurements. Although integration of imaging and omics data is a challenging task for the imaging community, such efforts will truly benefit personalized medicine by allowing us to see an individual from macro- to microscale levels.

This was a prospective observational study conducted in eight bedded pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary care hospital. One hundred and one critically ill non-diabetic children between ages of 1 month to 16 years were studied from the day of admission till discharge or death. Serial blood sugars were determined first at admission, thereafter every 12 hourly in all children. Blood glucose level above 126 mg/dl (>7 mmol/dl) was considered as hyperglycemia. Children with hyperglycemia were followed 6 hourly till blood glucose fell below 126 mg/dl. Hyper and non-hyperglycemic children were compared with respect to length of stay, mechanical ventilation, use of inotrops and final outcome. Survivors and non-survivors were compared in relation to admission blood glucose, peak blood glucose level and duration of hyperglycemia. Seventy (69.3%) children had hyperglycemia. Requirement of ventilation [(23) 32.9% vs.(3) 9.7%], requirement of inotropic support [(27) 38.6% vs.(5) 16.1%], Mean length of stay in PICU (7.91 ± 5.01 vs. 5.58 ± 1.95 days) and mortality (28.6% vs. 3.2%) among hyperglycemic children was significantly higher ( < 0.05) than that of non-hyperglycemic. Logistic regression analysis showed Peak blood glucose level and duration of hyperglycemia has independent association with increased risk of death. Incidence of hyperglycemia is high in critically ill children and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

Logistic regression analysis showed Peak blood glucose level and duration of hyperglycemia has independent association with increased risk of death. Incidence of hyperglycemia is high in critically ill children and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Introduction Hyperglycemia is a stress response in critically ill patients[1] due to peripheral insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency, impaired glucose metabolism[12] and often additional effects by medications like catecholamine, glucocorticoids and exogenous dextrose administration.[2] In acute stress, hyperglycemia is considered adaptive, both by providing glucose-dependant organs substrate for energy needs and by preserving intravascular volume with increased serum osmolarity.[345] Though large number of studies revealed significant association between hyperglycemia and poor outcome in critically ill adults there is little knowledge about incidence of hyperglycemia and its effect in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). It is unclear whether hyperglycemia is a marker of critical illness in children or an etiological factor contributing to worse outcome. Hyperglycemia in pediatric population may have different effects on morbidity and mortality compared with adults as a consequence of different metabolic demands,[6] differences in co-morbid conditions[7] or age-dependant factors.[8] Hyperglycemia may be less prevalent among children because diabetes mellitus is much less common in children.[910] However, duration of hyperglycemia and index of glucose variability are associated with increased mortality in critically ill children.[910] Among infants with necrotising enterocolitis, hyperglycemia is common and is associated with increased length of stay and increased mortality.[11] Hyperglycemia is an important negative prognostic factor in children with severe head injury,[12] gunshot wounds to the brain,[13] and multisystem trauma.[14] Stress hyperglycemia has been described in children with cystic fibrosis, sepsis, near drowning, falls, traumatic brain injury and following cardiac surgery.[15161718192021] This study was conducted to determine the incidence and association of hyperglycemia with outcome of critically ill children.Materials and Methods This was a prospective cross-sectional analysis of the critically ill children admitted at eight bedded PICU at a tertiary care center over a study period of 1 year from 1st August 2007 to 31st July 2008. Two hundred and thirty six critically ill children admitted from age group 1 month to 16 years during study period. Children who were on long term steroid, beta agonist or intravenous glucose therapy before their arrival or those with history of diabetes mellitus were excluded. Children who expired in less than 24 h of admission were also excluded. In addition, all post-operative cardiac surgery children who were cared for in separate cardiac intensive care units were also excluded from the study. By these exclusion criteria one hundred and one children were included in the study. All children in the study were studied from day of admission and followed up till death or discharge. Relevant clinical details regarding age, gender, weight, family history of diabetes mellitus, past history, present diagnosis, vital parameters, treatment required in the form of IV fluids, inotropic support, length of stay in PICU, any operative procedure done, use of steroid, duration of mechanical ventilation if required, clinical outcome, and routine investigations performed were recorded for all 101 children. Severity of illness was measured byPediatric Risk of mortality score (PRISM II). Hyperglycemia was defined as a blood glucose level of >126 mg/dL (>7.0 mmol/L). This was based on report of a WHO consultation on diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus.[22] Serial blood glucose levels were monitored first at admission, and thereafter every 12 hourly in all children. Children with hyperglycemia were followed with 6 hourly blood glucose monitoring till blood glucose fell below 126 mg/dl, and this period in PICU was defined as duration of hyperglycemia. Highest blood glucose value measured during PICU stay after first measurement was defined as peak blood glucose. All patients received dextrose containg IV fluids but no patient in this study had undergone insulin infusion for glucose control. Blood glucose paired values included both whole-blood bed side glucometer(Accu-check senor comfort-Brand Roche) and chemistry laboratory serum values (Chem well analyzer, awareness technology, Inc.). The bedside glucometer was calibrated and checked daily, and laboratory glucose analyzer was calibrated every 6 months and checked daily. The study population of 101 patients were grouped as hyperglycemic (those with peak blood glucose >126 mg/dL) and non-hyperglycemic (those with peak blood glucose ≤126 mg/dL). Two groups were compared with each other with demographic variables like age, sex, weight, admission symptoms, nutritional status, final diagnosis, and vital signs at admission. Critical care illness variable like use of inotrope agents, requirement of mechanical ventilation, duration of ventilation, duration of stay in PICU, and final outcome was also compared. Actual time spent from intubation till extubation was defined as ‘ventilator days’ and duration in PICU excluding ventilator days was considered as “ventilator free days”. As ventilator days may appear short in cases of death of patients occurring in short duration after admission, both “ventilators days” along with “ventilator free days” were considered for comparing duration of ventilation. Survivors and non-survivors were compared in relation to admission blood glucose, peak blood glucose and duration of hyperglycemia. The data were presented as mean ± Standard deviation. Normally distributed continuous variables were compared with Student's t-test and categorical variables were compared with Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. For non-normally distributed (skewed) data median was used instead of mean and was compared using “median test”. For paired samples, degree of concordance was calculated by Kendall's W test. After determination of individual factors associated with mortality by univariate analysis, a binary logistic regression model of significant factors associated with mortality was developed. The results of regression model were presented as adjusted odds ratio with 95%Confidence intervals. Wald's chi square value was used to test unique contribution of each predictor. Regression model adequacy was tested by Omnibus test of model coefficients, Negelkerke R square and Hosmer and Lemeshow chi-sqare test. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to validate predicted probabilities of death. In all comparisons, P < 0.05 was considered significant. IBM SPSS software 19.0 was used for statistical analysis.Results Total study population consisted of 101 children with median age of 2.2 years and median weight 12 kg. Seventy (69.3%) were hyperglycemic and 31 (30.7%) were non-hyperglycemics. For the given effect size population, means of (196.2 Vs 107.6), SD (54.7 Vs 9.9), sample size (70 and 31) and alpha (0.05,2 tailed) power was 1.00. Both groups were comparable with respect to demographic variables like age, sex, weight, nutritional status, presenting complaints, disease pattern and severity of illness. Vital parameters at admission like mean temperature (99.2 ± 1.7°F vs. 99.4 ± 1.5°F), mean heart rate (123.5 ± 33 vs. 117.4 ± 27.80/min), mean respiratory rate (39.2 ± 19.1 vs. 40.9 ± 20.3/min), use of steroids and PRISM II score (8.32 ± 3.07 Vs 8.03 ± 3.68) were also comparable between the two groups [Table 1].Table 1 Comparative demography in hyperglycemic verses non-hyperglycemic children Male patient to female patient ratio in hyperglycemic children was 1.6:1. Incidence of hyperglycemia was 70.4% in the age group of 1 month-12 months, 64.3% in age group of 1 year to 5 years and 75% in above 5 years age group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of hyperglycemia among well-nourished (71%) and malnourished children (63.6% in children with grade I PEM, 72.7% in grade II PEM, 100% in grade III PEM). Hyperglycemia was almost similar in all the disease categories without significant preference to a particular system. Incidence of hyperglycemia in children with respiratory disease was 64%, in diarrheal cases 62.5%, in neurological cases 71.4%, in infective cases 81.8%, and in miscellaneous cases 64%. Among hyperglycemic children 47 (67.2%) had hyperglycemia at admission and remaining 23 (32.8%) developed it eventually during their PICU stay. Median time to reach peak blood glucose level was 12 hrs. Median duration of hyperglycemia was 72 hrs. Though the requirement of mechanical ventilation (32.9% vs. 9.7%) among hyperglycemic children was significantly higher than that of non-hyperglycemic, there was no significant difference between median duration of ventilator days or ventilator free days among the two groups. Inotropic support requirement was also significantly higher (38.6% vs. 16.1) in hyperglycemics. Mean length of stay in PICU was significantly longer for hyperglycemics (7.91 ± 5.01 vs. 5.58 ± 1.95 days) than that of non-hyperglycemics. Out of the total 101 children studied, 21 (20.8%) expired and mortality was significantly higher (28.6% vs. 3.2%)) in hyperglycemic children than non-hyperglycemics [Table 2].Table 2 Comparison of morbidity and mortality between hyperglycemics and non-hyperglycemics Though admission blood glucose (192.38 ± 59.08 mg/dL vs. 147.59 ± 62.12 mg/dL) was significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors, it was not associated (Odds ratio 1.714,95% C.I. 0.649-4.725 and P = 0.33) with increased risk of death. Median time to reach peak blood glucose was also not significantly (p-0.053) different between survivor and nonsurvivors. Peak blood glucose (198.43 ± 51.17 mg/dL vs. 162.45 ± 62.09 mg/dL), duration of hyperglycemia (79.2 ± 42 h vs. 56.88 ± 26.65 h), requirement of mechanical ventilation (52.4% vs. 18.8%), requirement of inotrops (57.1% vs. 25%) and PRISM II score (10.24 ± 2.16 vs. 7.90 ± 3.55) were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors. [Table 5]. These factors were included as predictors in binary logistic regression model enter method to test their independent contribution for mortality. Values of Omnibus model coefficent (22.042.p, 0.000 at df = 5 Nagelkerke R square (0.306) and Hosmer and Lemeshow test (Chi-square 4.911 at df-8, sig. 767) indicated strong predictive value and overall fitness ofthe regression model.Table 3 Multivariate analysis of factors associated with mortality by logistic regressionTable 4 ROC curve analysis of factors associated with mortality Kendall's W coefficient was (0.812, chi2-81.99, df 1) significant (P < 0.000) for paired values of glucose in this study Table 5.Table 5 Comparisons of survivors and non-survivors Peak blood glucose level (odds ratio-8.256, wald-3.86, P = 0.049 at df-1) and duration of hyperglycemia (odds ratio-1.021, wald 4.833, P = 0.028 at df-1) were independently associated with increased risk of death. Mechanical ventilation (odds ratio-2.195, wald-1.596, P = 0.206 at df-1) and use of inotrops (odds ratio-1.494, wald-0.402, P = 0.526 at df-1) were not found as to be independent predictors of mortality while PRISM II (odds 1.229, wald-3.82, P = 0.051 at df - 1) score fell just short of statistical significance [Table 3]. The area under ROC curve for peak blood glucose (0.806 with sensitivity 90% and specificiy 67.5%) and for PRISM II score and mortality (0.736 with sensitivity 75% and specificity 68.7%) was higher than that for duration of hyperglycemia, (0.641 with sensitivity 40% and specificity 91.8%) [Table 4]. Kendall's W coefficient was (0.812, χ2-81.99, df 1) significant (P < 0.000) for paired values of glucose in this study.Discussion The findings of our studies emphasize higher incidence of hyperglycemia in critically ill children. Some authors in the past have defined hyperglycemia as blood glucose level above 150 mg/dl or above 200 mg/dl and found incidence ranging from 16.7% to 56%.[232425] We defined hyperglycemia as blood glucose level above above 126 mg/dl or (>7 mmol/l) as similar level considered in previous studies[926] and as per revised definition for diagnosis of diabetes (fasting blood glucose level >126 mg/dl) in children by WHO[22] Ninety six (95%) out of 101 acutely ill children were in the fasting state for >12 hours and remaining 5 (5%) were in fasting state for >10 hrs. Higher incidence of hyperglycemia in our study was comparable with studies like Srinivasan et al.,[9] Wintergerst et al.,[10] Allen et al.,[27] and Yung et al.[28] [Table 6]. This strikingly higher incidence in our critically ill study population underscores the need to recognize that hyperglycemia is common in such acutely ill children.Table 6 Comparison of incidence of hyperglycemia with previous studies No significant difference in incidence of hyperglycemia was found in children with different age groups, systemic diseases and nutritional status which was consistent with Gupta et al.[23] Very high incidence of hyperglycemia was documented in ventilated children by Srinivasan et al.,[9] Branco et al.,[24] Allen et al.,[27] and Yung et al.[28] as in our study which could be explained by systemic and pulmonary effects of hyperglycemia.[24]. Day et al.[29] found that among children with meningococcemia requiring mechanical ventilation, patients with lower blood glucose had less duration of ventilation required. Yates et al.[20] found that prolonged hyperglycemia was associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation. We could not find such association of duration of mechanical ventilation with hyperglycemia. We found children with hyperglycemia had higher requirement of inotropic agents. This association could be explained by higher severity of illness in this group. Similar significant association was found by Branco et al.[24] and Day et al.[29] Consistent with our findings Wintergerest et al.,[10] Faustino et al,[25] and Branco et al.,[24] observed that increase in peak blood glucose levels were significantly associated with increase in ICU length of stay. Hyperglycemia has been implicated as a predictor of adverse outcome after cardiac surgery.[28] In children, hyperglycemia is associated with worse outcome after severe sepsis[21] and traumatic brain injury.[12] Mortality in hyperglycemic children was significantly higher (28.6% vs. 3.2%) in our study. Similar findings were observed by Yung et al.,[28] Gupta et al.,[23] and Osier et al.[30] We found that the admission blood glucose level was significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors as in the Ruiz Margo et al.[26] study. But in contrast toYung et al.[28] there was no independent association of admission hyperglycemia with death in our study. Association of Peak blood glucose with mortality has been documented by Srinivasan et al.,[9] Branco et al.,[21] and Yates et al.[20] like our study. Odds ratio for peak blood glucose level in our study (8.25) was comparable with Branco et al.,[21] (6.1) but it was much higher than that of Srinivasan et al.,[9] (1.2). Area under ROC curve (0.806) for peak blood glucose with high sensitivity (90%) and moderate specificity (67.5) in our study was comparable with Branco et al.,[21] (AUC 0.754, sensitivity 71.4% and specificity 72.4%). Peak blood gluose level as independent predictor of death has comparable AUC with PRISM II (0.736) score in our study. Duration of hyperglycemia was significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors. It was also an independent risk factor for death in our study with odds ratio comparable with that of Yates et al.[20] and Srinivasan et al.9 Area under ROC curve (0.641) for duration of hyperglycemia was lower as compared to that of peak blood glucose level with very low sensitivity (40%) and high specificity (91.8%). The association of peak blood glucose levels and duration of hyperglycemia with mortality was independent of severity of illness, inotrops use, mechanical ventilation or steroid use, suggesting that hyperglycemia may not be just an epiphenomenon, but a maladaptive response to stress. Over estimation of risk of mortality due to hyperglycemia was possible in our study related to limitation of the study design. We have excluded sizeable group of children who were on IV glucose infusion, inotropes and steroid before admission to our PICU as per our exclusion criteria. The eventually included patients also received steroids and vasopressors. So the difference between included and excluded patients may be only the phase of stabilization. Inclusion of these patients could have reduced the bias with improvement in validity of our study. As we have demonstrated that hyperglycemia occurs commonly in critically ill children and may be associated with poor outcome, glycemic control may confer survival advantage as it does in adults. Prospective, randomized, controlled trials related to glucose control in these children are needed.Conclusion Incidence of hyperglycemia in critically ill non-diabetic children was high in a selected cohort. Requirement of ventilation and inotropic support, length of PICU stay and mortality were significantly higher in hyperglycemic children. Peak blood glucose levels and longer duration of hyperglycemia were independently associated with mortality.Recommendations Close monitoring of blood sugar levels is required in critically ill children, especially those who require ventilation and inotropic support.

Patients are characterized by multiple disturbances of lipid metabolism, profound hypotonia and neonatal seizures, and distinct craniofacial malformations. Median live expectancy of ZS patients is less than one year. While the molecular basis of peroxisome biogenesis and metabolism is known in considerable detail, it is unclear how peroxisome deficiency leads to the most severe neurological symptoms. Recent analysis of ZS mouse models has all but invalidated previous hypotheses. We suggest that a regulatory rather than a metabolic defect is responsible for the drastic impairment of brain function in ZS patients. Using microarray analysis we identify diazepam binding inhibitor/acyl-CoA binding protein (DBI) as a candidate protein that might be involved in the pathogenic mechanism of ZS. DBI has a dual role as a neuropeptide antagonist of GABA(A) receptor signaling in the brain and as a regulator of lipid metabolism. Repression of DBI in ZS patients could result in an overactivation of GABAergic signaling, thus eventually leading to the characteristic hypotonia and seizures. The most important argument for a misregulation of GABA(A) in ZS is, however, provided by the striking similarity between ZS and "benzodiazepine embryofetopathy", a malformation syndrome observed after the abuse of GABA(A) agonists during pregnancy.

We present a tentative mechanistic model of the effect of DBI misregulation on neuronal function that could explain some of the aspects of the pathology of Zellweger syndrome. BackgroundClinical background of Zellweger syndrome Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is a class of inherited metabolic disorders caused by a deficiency in peroxisomal biogenesis (reviewed in [1,2]). The incidence of ZS is about 1/25,000 – 1/50,000 births. ZS patients are characterized by profound hypotonia and neonatal seizures, which – accompanied by feeding difficulties and psychomotor retardation – lead to an early death, usually in the first year of infancy. Another characteristic symptom is a distinct craniofacial malformation complex, consisting of high forehead, low/broad nasal bridge, epicanthus, high arched palate, and micrognathia. In addition, the severe disturbance of many peroxisomal metabolic pathways in ZS leads to a variety of defects in almost every organ, most prominently the liver (hepatomegaly in 78% of patients, fibrosis in 76%), the kidney (renal cysts in 98%), and the brain. In the latter, white matter abnormalities and a unique neuronal migration defect in the cerebral hemispheres, the cerebellum, and the inferior olivary complex are the most striking symptoms. Biochemically, ZS patients are characterized by the absence of functional peroxisomes and an almost complete disruption of peroxisomal beta-oxidation, leading to the accumulation of branched and very long-chain fatty acids, abnormal bile acids, and leukotrienes. In addition, the biosynthesis of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and plasmalogens is impaired, resulting in a drastic decrease of these important lipid components of the central nervous system. The metabolism of pipecolic acid and the peroxisomal steps of isoprenoid biosynthesis are also impaired to some extent.Pathogenetic mechanism of Zellweger syndrome ZS is caused by mutations in any one of about a dozen components of the peroxisome assembly machinery [3]. The cell biology of the disease has been elucidated in considerable detail during the last decade. However, it is still completely unknown, how the deficiency in peroxisomal metabolism leads to the severe phenotype and extremely poor prognosis of ZS patients. Several mechanisms have been suggested: Accumulation of branched and very long-chain fatty acids could lead to a structural disruption of cell membranes, particularly in the central nervous system (reviewed in [4]). The disturbance of lipid metabolism could also lead to a more subtle disturbance of membrane micro-domains (rafts, caveolae) involved in intercellular signaling. Deficiency of major myelin constituents, such as plasmalogens, DHA, and cholesterol, might lead to impaired neuronal development (see for example [5] for a review of the beneficial effects of DHA supplementation in ZS patients). Increased levels of leukotrienes due to beta-oxidation deficiency could precipitate an inflammatory process that might be involved in the pathogenesis of the brain defects [6,7]. Studies in a mouse model of ZS have shown that reduced levels of the ether phospholipid platelet activating factor (PAF) and consequent impairment of glutamatergic signaling might cause the neuronal migration defects by an unknown mechanism [8]. The importance of lipid metabolism for the pathogenesis of ZS is underlined by the phenotype of peroxisomal single enzyme-deficient patients. Disruption of peroxisomal beta-oxidation at the level of multifunctional protein type 2 leads to the same pathological syndrome as ZS, although the patients have a slightly better prognosis [9]. Patients with acyl-CoA:dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase deficiency have rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, which shares many of the key symptoms with ZS, including hypotonia, feeding problems, growth retardation, and early neonatal death [9]. On the other hand, defects of many other peroxisomal enzymes (catalase, glutaryl-CoA oxidase, phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase, 2-methylacyl-CoA racemase, pipecolic acid oxidase, and mevalonate kinase) as well as deficiencies in non-peroxisomal metabolism do not lead to ZS. The most important recent data on the pathogenesis of ZS come from the analysis of three mouse models, that are deficient in different components of the peroxisomal biogenesis machinery (Pex2, Pex5, and Pex11beta, respectively [10-12]). All three mice show an almost exact phenocopy of the human ZS, including severe hypotonia at birth, impaired neuronal migration in the same brain areas, and early neonatal death. However, some important pathologies such as hepatomegaly, renal cysts, and bone abnormalities are not recapitulated. Mice disrupted in Pex11alpha are externally indistinguishable from wild-type animals [13]. Detailed analysis of these ZS models has demonstrated that DHA and isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthesis are unlikely to be central to the pathogenic mechanism [14-16]. A more detailed study of Pex5 knock-out mice further established that changes in very long chain fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, or plasmalogen levels in brain are unlikely to be responsible for the neuronal migration defects [17]. Most strikingly, however, the Pex11beta knockout mouse (which has intact peroxisomes) dies of ZS, but shows almost normal peroxisomal metabolism, including normal levels of very long-chain fatty acids and plasmalogens, thus confuting the major pathogenic hypotheses listed above [12]. This conclusively establishes that the obvious biochemical disturbances are concomitant but not causal to the most serious symptoms of ZS patients. In addition, analysis of a mouse model of peroxisomal beta-oxidation deficiency indicates that the most severe ZS-like symptoms are independent of the characteristic neuronal migration defects [18,19]. Figure 1 summarizes the molecular conditions leading to Zellweger-like syndromes in human and mouse.Figure 1 Molecular conditions leading to Zellweger-like syndromes in human and mouse. Biochemical and pathological consequences that are not common to all disorders are indicated. PEXn = any of the peroxisome biogenesis proteins that can be mutated in classical Zellweger syndrome. MFP1/2 = multifunctional proteins of peroxisomal beta-oxidation. DHAPAT = dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyl transferase. VLCFAs = very long-chain fatty acids. DHA = docosahexaenoic acid.Identification of candidate genes by microarray analysis We suggest that a regulatory defect is central to the severe disease phenotype of ZS patients. Even a slight disturbance of specific pathway intermediates, such as seen in the Pex11beta knockout mouse, could trigger a catastrophic regulatory response that escalates by inappropriate activation of feedback loops. Such a mechanism has recently been identified in peroxisome-deficient yeast, where a slight increase in cytosolic aminoadipate levels is suggested to lead to a full-blown activation of the lysine biosynthetic pathway via a positive feedback mechanism [20]. We decided to use microarray data to identify possible players involved in such a misregulation mechanism in human ZS. Microarrays provide an unbiased survey of gene expression levels in human tissues and cells under various experimental conditions. Many hundred data sets, examining most of the predicted genes of the human genome, are now publicly available for exploratory analysis. Based on the known clinical data of ZS patients, we defined three criteria for candidate genes: 1. A candidate should be regulated positively or negatively in concert with lipid metabolism genes, because changes in acyl-CoA derivatives are the only common factor in ZS and the ZS-like single enzyme deficiencies. 2. To be active in a regulatory pathway, a candidate should be involved in a signaling pathway or in transcriptional regulation, so that feedback regulation is possible. 3. Because the most serious symptoms of ZS affect the brain, an ideal candidate would be involved in brain or neuron function. Using these criteria we identified only a single candidate gene, Diazepam Binding Inhibitor, DBI, in all data sets available in the Stanford Microarray Database . Co-regulation of DBI with lipid metabolism is found consistently in experiments representing the two current microarray methodologies, Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays [21] and spotted two-color cDNA arrays [22] (Table 1). DBI is also among the most highly upregulated genes in lovastatin-treated squamous cell carcinomas [23].Table 1 Ten genes that have expression profiles most similar to diazepam binding inibitor, DBI, in two large-scale microarray expression profiling studies, as quantified by Pearson correlation coefficient r (the top 10 neighbors of DBI are shown for each sample set, corresponding to r > 0.73 for the fibroblast samples).

The expression profiles can be explored and compared at (fibroblast samples) and (carcinoma samples).Properties of Diazepam Binding Inhibitor DBI is a particularly promising candidate for the regulatory pathway responsible for the brain and morphological defects associated with ZS. It has a dual function as a secreted GABA(A) receptor neuroregulatory peptide and as an acyl-CoA binding protein involved in lipid metabolism (reviewed in [24,25]). DBI is expressed almost ubiquitously, including in a variety of glial and neuronal cell types in many brain regions [26-32]. In the brain DBI is processed to various neuropeptides (triakontatetraneuropeptide TTN = DBI17-50, octadecaneuropeptide ODN = DBI33-50, eikosaneuropeptide ENP = DBI51-70, and others [33]) with slightly varying activity. DBI was first identified by its ability to displace the GABA(A) agonist diazepam and hence is able to antagonistically modulate the GABA(A) receptor in the brain. GABA is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and the GABA(A) receptor is the main target of benzodiazepine sedatives, such as diazepam. Increases in DBI serum levels were found in epileptic patients [34]. In contrast, DBI was found to be the only identifiable protein downregulated in both schizophrenic and Alzheimer's disease patients [35]. In addition to GABA(A) receptor, DBI and its processing products bind to the ubiquitous mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor pBR and play a crucial role in the acute stimulation of steroidogenesis [36-38]. A third type of DBI receptor mediates rapid release of intracellular calcium, but remains to be characterized in detail [39,40]. In its role as an acyl-CoA binding protein, DBI specifically binds to medium and long-chain acyl-CoA esters (but not to fatty acids, acyl carnitines, cholesterol and a number of nucleotides; [41]) and is involved in fatty acid-mediated regulation of gene expression and the formation of intracellular acyl-CoA pools (reviewed in [42]). In vitro studies have identified functional sterol response elements (SREBP binding sites) and peroxisome proliferator gamma response elements (PPARgamma binding sites) in the DBI gene promoter [43,44]. Finally, DBI has a stimulating effect on the pancreatic cholecystokinin and insulin system [45,46], that might be related to the pancreatic islet hyperplasia seen in many ZS patients.Benzodiazepines, GABAergic signaling, and Zellweger syndrome Neonatal epileptic seizures and floppy infant syndrome are two important symptoms that point to an involvement of defective GABAergic signaling in ZS pathogenesis. However, the most striking connection between Zellweger syndrome and DBI-mediated misregulation of GABAergic signaling is provided by the report of severe developmental malformations in babies born to mothers that had used benzodiazepines such as diazepam during pregnancy. Laegreid et al. [47-49] have described a "benzodiazepine embryofetopathy" that involves extreme hypotonia, craniofacial abnormalities (epicanthus, low nasal bridge, abnormal ears, high arched palate), feeding difficulties, and delayed neuromotor development (table 2). The similarity to ZS was so striking that one of the first patients described by Laegreid et al. [47] was later recognized to be a genuine ZS case [50,51]. However, two others of their patients were tested biochemically and did not show accumulation of very long and branched-chain fatty acids, a biochemical hallmark of ZS. One of these two died at 11 weeks of age, and upon autopsy was found to have slight cortical dysplasia and single-cell neuronal heterotopias in white matter [48].Table 2 Comparison of selected symptoms in "fetal benzodiazepine syndrome", Zellweger syndrome and peroxisomal beta-oxidation (multifunctional protein-2) deficiency."benzodiazepine embryofetopathy" [48]Zellweger syndrome [2]MFP2 deficiency [9]hypotonia/floppy-baby syndrome100% (8/8)99% (94/95)98% (41/42)epicanthic folds100% (8/8)92% (33/36)present1feeding difficulties88% (7/8)96% (74/77)91% (10/11)mental retardation86% (6/7)100% (45/45)yesshort upturned nose with low nasal bridge75% (6/8)100% (23/23)presentmicrognathia63% (5/8)100% (18/18)presentHighly arched palate50% (4/8)95% (35/37)presentabnormal ears50% (4/8)98% (39/40)presenthigh foreheadpresent97% (58/60)presentneonatal seizuresno92% (56/61)95% (36/38)neuronal migration defectsyes, in single case examinedyes, characteristic88% (15/17) 1 79% (30/38) MFP2-deficient patients have a combination of dysmorphic features [9]. Numbers of affected and examined cases are indicated in parentheses. The work by Laegreid et al. was heavily criticized for its epidemiological validity (e.g. [52]) and later studies did not find a significant correlation between benzodiazepine use during pregnancy and birth defects (reviewed in [53]). However, some reports have linked diazepam to oral clefts, distal limb defects, microcephaly, and cardiovascular anomalies (reviewed in [53]). In addition, it is well established that high doses of diazepam lead to craniofacial malformations in rodents [54-57] and mice carrying targeted disruptions of the GABAergic pathway consistently develop a cleft palate, a rather common feature of Zellweger patients [58,59]. We are not aware of any other drug-induced teratogenic syndrome that mimics ZS. It is quite unlikely that all of Laegreid's patients just had a mild form of ZS, as they did neither show the characteristic biochemical abnormalities nor the disease progression with age. Also, consistent with the fact that benzodiazepine exposure is largely terminated at birth, they did not show the neonatal seizures that affect ZS patients.Presentation of the hypothesis We suggest the following tentative mechanistic model for the pathogenesis of DBI misregulation in ZS (figure 2):Figure 2 Possible regulatory network leading to disturbed GABAergic signaling in peroxisome-deficient patients. Arrows indicate the predicted direction of change in the patients. See text for details. Peroxisome deficiency leads to an accumulation of peroxisomal metabolic intermediates (metabolite X), most likely acyl-CoA derivatives that are also disturbed by the single enzyme defects that cause ZS-like syndromes. Directly or indirectly, metabolite X causes an inactivation and down-regulation of DBI and a decrease in DBI release, possibly by replacing its physiological acyl-CoA ligands. Decreased activity of DBI affects two intertwined feedback loops. In the first loop, decrease of DBI releases the inhibition of GABA(A) receptor [60]. Overactivation of GABA(A) receptor inhibits glutamate release [61] and consequently causes a decrease in NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic signaling [62]. This in turn causes a lack of calcium release in the target cells and a deficiency of DBI secretion and expression [63]. The second loop starts by a decrease in DBI action on its non-GABA(A) receptor and a subsequent lack of DBI-stimulated calcium release [39,40,64]. Both pathways converge on the decrease in intracellular calcium, that results in an inhibition of DBI release [65] and closes the loop. A hypothetical ancillary loop could involve positive crosstalk between the over-activated GABA(A) receptor and its counterpart GABA(B), which is known to inhibit DBI release [66]. The two loops are not necessarily present in the same cells, and each of them may involve several adjacent cells. Also, different processing products of DBI act on intracellular calcium using different pathways [67], and may lead to additional differentiation of the DBI misregulation effect. The main feature is that both loops tend to enhance the down-regulation of DBI, thus amplifying and maintaining a small initial disturbance caused by the peroxisomal defect. Both loops involve a deficiency of NMDA receptor-mediated calcium release, in agreement with observations in ZS mouse models [8]. Gressens et al. (2000) found that administration of GABA at a concentration of 0.25 mg/kg twice a day had no effect on neuronal migration in peroxisome-deficient and control mice. This finding might indicate that the neuronal migration defect is mediated by the direct effect of DBI-derived peptides on intracellular calcium through its non-GABA(A) receptors. Misregulation of DBI and the consequent disinhibition of GABAergic signaling should lead to diverse defects in various brain areas. A region of special interest is the inferior olive, which is malformed or absent in classical ZS. Olivary axon collaterals do not only innervate non-GABAergic neurons in the cerebellar nuclei, but also GABAergic nucleo-olivary cells, thus establishing a direct feedback loop to the inferior olive [68]. Purkinje cells, which show characteristic heterotopias in the cerebellum of ZS patients are also GABAergic [69,70]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated recently that excessive GABA(A) receptor activation by neurosteroids or benzodiazepines initiates a slow form of neuronal death in cultured hippocampal neurons [71]. This could be the basis of the increased neuronal apoptosis observed in ZS. It should also be noted that the suggested mechanism for ZS brain disturbances bears conceptual similarity to that for fetal alcohol syndrome, where a combination of NMDA blockade and GABA(A) over-activation leads to widespread apoptosis in the developing brain [72]. The observation of cleft palate in GABA signaling-deficient mouse models indicates that disregulation of the GABA(A) pathway might also be responsible for the malformation syndromes observed in ZS patients and in benzodiazepine embryofetopathy [58,59]. DBI is an especially suitable candidate for ZS pathogenesis because it is shown to integrate signals from a variety of lipid-related pathways (fatty acids, sterols, steroids). Its restricted binding properties narrow down the search for a specific metabolite X that is responsible for the initial repression of DBI, and the feedback loops explain how even a slight disturbance that is common to all ZS-like syndromes can tip the balance towards a disinhibition of the GABAergic system, resulting in the severe disorders that are found in all patients.Testing the hypothesis The recent availability of several peroxisome-deficient mouse models provides an excellent opportunity to directly test the GABA/DBI model of Zellweger pathogenesis. This would involve a detailed analysis of DBI isoform levels in wild type and mutant brains, as well as a study of GABA agonist and antagonist effects, both in vivo and in neuronal explants. Additional in vitro studies could be used to determine the molecular details of DBI regulation and processing, to test the existence of the feedback loops postulated by the model. After the general mechanism has been established, identification of "metabolite X" would be crucial and could be achieved, e.g., by examining the effect of fractionated brain extracts on a DBI reporter cell line.Implications of the hypothesis Currently, no successful therapy for peroxisome deficient patients is available. Identification of a GABA component to the pathogenesis of Zellweger syndrome has obvious implications for the treatment of affected patients. Straightforward pharmacological intervention with well-known GABA antagonists could be used to counteract the misregulation and to interrupt the pathological feedback loop. In addition, even if the molecular details of the proposed mechanism turn out to be incorrect, consideration of an amplification of minor metabolic changes by positive feedback changes could influence the search for "metabolite X", which by implication of the present model would be a low-concentration intermediate that binds DBI, and hence is probably a Co-enzyme A thioester.Conclusions We suggest that peroxisomal deficiency leads to an unidentified disturbance of lipid metabolism that causes misregulation of the diazepam binding inhibitor, DBI. This misregulation affects two independent systems and is amplified by specific feedback loops: The DBI/GABA(A) system and the DBI/calcium system. The independence of the two systems agrees with the observation in peroxisomal beta-oxidation-deficient mice, where hypotonia and early death occur without neuronal migration defects. The activation and subsequent escalation of feedback loops would explain why several defects with a widely varying biochemical background lead to the same complex of symptoms. Our rather simplistic model necessarily ignores many details that complicate the picture, e.g. we do not consider the regional and developmental heterogeneity in the GABAergic system (e.g. excitatory GABA action in early development and the enormous plasticity of the central nervous system that will result in important compensatory regulation phenomena. Also, relatively little is known about the functional distribution of DBI in the central nervous system and its autocrine vs. paracrine effects. In fact, the DBI hypothesis is not able to explain all observations in peroxisome deficiencies. However, it seems that the DBI hypothesis is able to explain a larger part of the observations than previous ideas, e.g. the Pex11beta k.o. phenotype seems to follow naturally from the suggestion that slight initiating changes in a metabolite might lead to an escalating response via feed-back mechanisms. It is very well possible that the DBI hypothesis is incomplete and/or over-simplified (for example, explaining some differences between Zellweger and Zellweger-like syndromes might require postulating different mechanisms of action for DBI in these conditions) but we hope that even a partially correct hypothesis may be able to point research into a useful direction, e.g. concerning the importance of small perturbations amplified by misactivated feedback mechanisms. The existence of several mouse models of ZS should allow for rapid testing and refinement of our idea that misregulation of DBI is involved in the pathogenesis of Zellweger syndrome.Competing interests None declared.Pre-publication history The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:

Either Wnt/β-catenin or estrogen signaling pathway has been shown to play an important role in regulating skeletal development and maintaining adult tissue homeostasis. Here, we investigate the potential crosstalk and synergy of these two signaling pathways in regulating osteogenic differentiation of MPCs. We find that the activation of estrogen receptor (ER) signaling by estradiol (E2) or exogenously expressed ERα in MPCs synergistically enhances Wnt3A-induced early and late osteogenic markers, as well as matrix mineralization. The E2 or ERα-mediated synergy can be effectively blocked by ERα antagonist tamoxifen. E2 stimulation can enhance endochondral ossification of Wnt3A-transduced mouse fetal limb explants. Furthermore, exogenously expressed ERα significantly enhances the maturity and mineralization of Wnt3A-induced subcutaneous and intramuscular ectopic bone formation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that E2 does not exert any detectable effect on β-catenin/Tcf reporter activity. However, ERα expression is up-regulated within the first 48h in AdWnt3A-transduced MPCs, whereas ERβ expression is significantly inhibited within 24h. Moreover, the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of estrogens aromatase is modulated by Wnt3A in a biphasic manner, up-regulated at 24h but reduced after 48h. Our results demonstrate that, while ER signaling acts synergistically with Wnt3A in promoting osteogenic differentiation, Wnt3A may crosstalk with ER signaling by up-regulating ERα expression and down-regulating ERβ expression in MPCs. Thus, the signaling crosstalk and synergy between these two pathways should be further explored as a potential therapeutic approach to combating bone and skeletal disorders, such as fracture healing and osteoporosis.

Introduction Osteogenic differentiation and bone formation from mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are initiated and regulated by a cascade of signaling pathways. MPCs are multipotent progenitors and can be isolated from numerous tissues, but mostly from bone marrow stromal cells. MPCs can undergo self-renewal and differentiate into multiple lineages, including osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages [1-3]. Osteogenic differentiation is a sequential cascade of events that recapitulates most of the skeletal development [4]. Maintaining bone homeostasis involves in bone formation and remodeling, which is regulated by numerous signaling pathways. For example, we identified BMP9 as one of the most potent BMPs among the 14 types of BMPs in inducing osteogenic differentiation of MPCs both in vitro and in vivo [5-8]. We have further found that BMP9-mediated osteogenic signaling cross-talks with several major signaling pathways, including Wnt, IGF2, retinoic acids, EGF, growth hormone, hypoxia, and MAPK pathways [9-19]. Wnt signaling plays a critical role in embryonic development, postnatal development, and adult tissue homeostasis [20,21]. The hallmark of canonical Wnt signaling is the stabilization of β-catenin in the cytoplasm upon activation. The canonical Wnt ligands bind to Fzd receptors and co-receptors LRP5 or LRP6, causing phosphorylation of Dvl, which inhibits GSK3β from phosphorylating β-catenin. As a result, β-catenin is stabilized and translocated into the nucleus, where β-catenin forms a transcriptional complex with Tcf/Lef to regulate the expression of target genes, such as c-myc, PPARδ, cyclin D1, and axin2 [21-24]. The role of Wnt signaling pathway in bone biology has gained considerable attention as several human pathologies of bone such as osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome, sclerosteosis and van Buchem’s disease have been associated with aberrant Wnt signaling [18,19,25-27]. Activating and inactivating aberrations of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in osteogenesis result in sclerosteosis and osteoporosis, respectively [18,19,25-27]. Thus, recent studies have sought to target Wnt signaling pathway to treat osteogenic disorders. Antibodies against endogenous antagonists, such as sclerostin and Dkk-1, have shown promising results in promoting bone formation and fracture healing [18,19,26,27]. Thus, understanding the role of Wnt signaling in bone formation has not only helped elucidate the pathogenesis of bone disorders but has also led to the development of potential therapeutic avenues to treat these disorders. Estrogen is essential in both genders, not only for the pubertal growth spurt and skeletal maturation, but also for the accrual and maintenance of bone mass throughout adult life [28-30]. The biological actions of estrogens are mediated by estrogen binding to one of two estrogen receptors (ERs) ERα and ERβ (ERβ), which belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily [31-33]. Upon ligand binding, the ERs dimerize and bind to estrogen response elements (EREs) in the promoters of target genes [31-34]. ERs may also regulate gene expression through protein-protein interactions with other DNA-binding transcription factors in the nucleus [31-33]. The characterization of mice lacking ERα, ERβ, or both has revealed that the receptor subtypes have overlapping but distinct roles in estrogen-dependent action in vivo [31-33]. Estrogen is now considered as a major hormonal regulator of bone metabolism in both women and men [35]. The major consequence of the loss of estrogen is an increase in bone resorption although estrogen deficiency is associated with an imbalance between bone resorption and formation, suggesting that estrogen may be also important for regulating bone formation at the cellular level [35]. Here, we investigate the possible crosstalk and synergy between ER signaling and canonical Wnt signaling in regulating osteogenic differentiation of MPCs. Using our previously characterized mesenchymal progenitor cells iMEFs which are treated with either estradiol (E2) or adenovirus-mediated exogenous expression of ERα, we find that the activation of ER signaling synergistically enhances Wnt3A-induced both early and late osteogenic markers, as well as matrix mineralization. The E2 or ERα-mediated synergy can be effectively blocked by ERα antagonist tamoxifen. E2 stimulation on Wnt3A-transduced mouse fetal limb explants leads to an expansion of hypertrophic chondrocyte and ossification zones and an increase in mean bone density. Ectopic bone formation via subcutaneous and intramuscular injections of Wnt3A and/or ERα-transduced MPCs reveals that ERα significantly enhances the maturity and mineralization of Wnt3A-induced ectopic bone masses. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that E2 does not exert any detectable effect on Wnt/β-catenin reporter activity. However, ERα expression is up-regulated within the first 48h in AdWnt3A-transduced MPCs, whereas ERβ expression is significantly inhibited within 24h. Furthermore, the aromatase (or estrogen synthase, Cyp19) exhibits a biphasic expression pattern, up-regulated at 24h but reduced after 48h, upon Wnt3A stimulation. Thus, our results demonstrate that while ER signaling acts synergistically with Wnt3A in promoting osteogenic differentiation, Wnt3A may crosstalk with ER signaling by up-regulating ERα expression and down-regulating ERβ expression in MPCs. It is conceivable that the signaling crosstalk and synergy between these two pathways should be further explored as a potential therapeutic approach to combating bone and skeletal disorders, such as fracture healing and osteoporosis.Materials and MethodsCell culture and chemicals HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells iMEFs were established in our lab and previously characterized [36]. Both cell lines were maintained under conditions as described [5,9,37,38]. Chemicals 17-β-estradiol (E2) and estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and prepared in DMSO. Unless indicated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) or Sigma-Aldrich.Construction and generation of recombinant adenoviruses expressing Wnt3A, ERα, RFP, and GFP The recombinant adenoviruses were constructed by using AdEasy technology as described [5,6,39-41]. The coding regions of mouse Wnt3A and human ERα were PCR amplified and cloned into an adenoviral shuttle vector and subsequently used to generate recombinant adenoviruses in HEK293 cells. The resulting adenoviruses were designated as AdWnt3A and AdERα. AdWnt3A also expresses GFP, whereas AdERα expresses RFP as a marker for monitoring infection efficiency. Analogous adenovirus expressing only RFP (AdRFP) or GFP (AdGFP) were used as controls [9-11,22,23,39,41-43].Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay ALP activity was assessed using a modified Great Escape SEAP Chemiluminescence Assay (BD Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and/or histochemical staining assay (using a mixture of 0.1 mg/mL of napthol AS-MX phosphate and 0.6 mg/mL of Fast Blue BB salt), as described [5,6,9-13,15,37,40,43,44]. For the chemiluminescence assays, each assay condition was performed in triplicate. The results were repeated in at least three independent experiments. ALP activity was normalized by total cellular protein concentrations among the samples.Mineralization assay (Alizarin Red S staining) Alizarin Red S staining was carried out as described previously [5,6,9-11,37,40,42,43,45]. Briefly, the treated cells were cultured in the presence of ascorbic acid (50 mg/mL) and β-glycerophosphate (10mM). At 10 days after infection, mineralized matrix nodules were stained for calcium precipitation by means of alizarin red S staining. Cells were fixed with 0.05% (v/v) glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 10min. After being washed with distilled water, fixed cells were incubated with 0.4% Alizarin Red S for 5min, followed by extensive washing with distilled water. The staining of calcium mineral deposits was recorded under bright-field microscopy.Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining IHC staining was carried out as previously described [13,46-49]. The cells were fixed with 10% formalin and washed with PBS, permeabilized with 1% NP-40 and blocked with 10% goat serum, followed by incubation with osteocalcin and osteopontin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1h. After washing, cells were incubated with biotin-labeled secondary antibody for 30min, followed by incubating cells with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate for 20min. The presence of the expected proteins were visualized by diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining and examined under a microscope. Stains without the primary antibody or with control IgG were used as negative controls.Transfection and luciferase reporter assay Exponentially growing cells were seeded in 25cm2 cell culture flasks and transfected with 2μg per flask of Tcf/β-catenin responsive luciferase reporter pTop-Luc using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described [9,11,50-53]. At 16h after transfection, cells were replated to 24-well plates and treated with 10-4mol/L to 10-8mol/L estradiol. After 24h, cells were lysed, and collected for luciferase assays using Promega’s Luciferase Assay Kit (Madison, WI). Each assay condition was performed in triplicate. Luciferase activity was normalized by total cellular protein concentrations among the samples. Relative Top-Luc reporter activity was expressed as mean ± SD.RNA isolation and semi-quantitative RT-PCR (sqPCR) analysis Total RNA was isolated with the TRIzol Reagents (Invitrogen) by following manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA synthesis was carried out by reverse-transcription reaction with hexamer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The cDNA products were further diluted 5 to10 fold and used as PCR templates. The sqPCR was carried out as described [9,12,13,15,44,54,55]. PCR primers (Table S1) were designed by using the Primer3 program to amplify the genes of interest (approximately 150 to 180bp). A touchdown cycling program was as follows: 94°C for 2min for 1 cycle; 92°C for 20 seconds, 68°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 12 cycles decreasing 1°C per cycle; and then at 92°C for 20 seconds, 57°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 20 seconds for 20 to 25 cycles depending on the abundance of a given transcript. PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels .All samples were normalized by the expression level of GAPDH.Mouse fetal limb explant culture All animal experiments reported in this study were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The University of Chicago (protocol Number #71108). All surgery was performed under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. The isolation and culture of mouse fetal limb explants was carried out as previously described [12,14,36]. Briefly, the forelimbs of mouse embryos (E18.5) were skinned, dissected under sterile conditions, and incubated in DMEM medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 50μg/mL ascorbic acid (Sigma), 1mM β-glycerophosphate, and 100μg/mL of penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C in humidified air with 5% CO2 for up to 14 days. Medium was changed every 3 days. The cultured limb explants were directly infected AdWnt3A and/or added with estradiol (10-6mol/L) 24h after dissection. At least five limb explants were included in each assay group. On day 7, calcein (100mM) was added to the medium. On day 10, the cultured tissues were harvested. Soft tissues were removed. The samples were subjected to fluorescence microscopy, micro-CT imaging, and histologic evaluation. Micro-computed tomographic (μCT) imaging analysis Cultured mouse fetal limb specimens were imaged using the µCT component of a GE Triumph (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) trimodality preclinical imaging system as described [12-15,36,44,56]. All image data analysis was performed using Amira 5.3 (Visage Imaging, Inc., San Diego, CA). The bone mean density heat maps were calculated as described[12,13,36,44,56].Stem cell implantation for ectopic bone formation The use and care of animals was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The subcutaneous and intramuscular ectopic bone formation assays were carried out as previously described [6,12-15,36,44,56]. Briefly, subconfluent iMEFs were co-infected with AdWnt3A, or AdGFP and AdERα for 24h. Infection efficiency was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. The infected cells were collected for subcutaneous injection (5×106/injection) into the flanks, or for intramuscular injection into the quadriceps of athymic nude mice (n=5 per group, 4–6-week old, male, Harlan Sprague Dawley). At 6 weeks after implantation, animals were euthanized. The implant sites were retrieved for histologic evaluation.Histologic evaluation Retrieved and cultured tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, decalcified, and paraffin-embedded. Serial sections of the embedded specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) as described [6,9,12,13,37,40,43,56].Statistical analysis Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical significances between treatment groups vs. control groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance and the two-tailed Student’s t test. A p-value of < 0.05 was defined as statistically significance.ResultsActivation of ER signaling enhances Wnt3A-induced early osteogenic differentiation of MPCs To determine if estrogen receptor signaling pathway exerts any effect on Wnt3A-induced osteogenic differentiation, we tested the effect of estradiol (E2) on Wnt3A-stimulated MPC line iMEFs. Exogenous expression of Wnt3A was mediated by a recombinant adenoviral vector, which was shown to transduce iMEFs with high efficiency (Figure 1A). As previously reported [9], Wnt3A was shown to induce early osteogenic marker ALP activity, which was further enhanced by the presence of E2 (0.1μM) (Figure 1A, bottom row) although E2 alone induced negligible ALP activity. To further demonstrate that these results were caused by the activation of estrogen receptor signaling pathway, we constructed an adenoviral vector to expresses human ERα, namely AdERα, which co-expresses RFP as a marker. The AdERα-mediated expression of human ERα was confirmed by sqPCR and Western blot (data not shown). When iMEFs were co-infected with Wnt3A and ERα adenoviruses, there was a significant increase in ALP activity in MPCs when compared with the Wnt3A alone group, although ERα overexpression alone exerted minimal or undetectable effect (Figure 1B). 10.1371/journal.pone.0082436.g001Figure 1Histochemical staining of estrogen and Wnt3A-stimulated ALP activity in MPCs. (A) Subconfluent iMEFs were infected with AdWnt3A or AdGFP and treated with estradiol (E2, 0.1μM) or DMSO. Adenovirus infection efficiency was documented at 24h post infection (top panel). At 5 days after infection/treatment, cells were fixed and subjected to ALP histochemical staining. Representative results are shown. (B) ALP activity in MPCs co-expressing Wnt3A and estrogen receptor α (ERα). Subconfluent iMEFs were co-infected with AdWnt3A and AdERα or AdGFP. Transduction efficiency was monitored for GFP (AdWnt3A and AdGFP) or RFP (AdERα) at 24h. Cells were fixed and stained for ALP activity at day 5. Representative results are shown. We further analyzed that dose-dependent nature of E2 or ERα on Wnt3A-induced ALP activity in MPCs, vice versa. When iMEF cells were transduced with a fixed titer of AdWnt3A, E2 was shown to enhance ALP activity in a dose-dependent manner and plateaued at around 10-8M (Figure 2A), compared with that of the DMSO controls (at least p<0.05). Accordingly, when iMEFs were stimulated with E2 (10-7M), transduction with increasing titers of AdWnt3A led to a dose-dependent increase of ALP activity at day 5 and day 7 (except the highest titer) (at least p<0.05) (Figure 2B). We obtained slimier dose-dependent increases of ALP activity when escalating titers of AdERα were used to co-infect iMEFs with AdWnt3A (Figure 2C), although we did observe a drop in ALP activity at the highest virus titer, which might have been caused by virus toxicity. Furthermore, we examined if the synergistic effect exerted by E2 and ERα could be reversed by tamoxifen. We found that E2-enhanced ALP activity in Wnt3A-stimulated iMEFs was significantly inhibited by tamoxifen at 5μM (p<0.05) and 10μM (p<0.01) (Figure 2D). Similarly, the synergistic effect between Wnt3A and ERα on ALP activity was effectively inhibited by tamoxifen at 2.5μM (p<0.05) and 5μM (p<0.01) (Figure 2E). Taken together, these results suggest that E2 stimulation and exogenous ERα expression may enhance Wn3A-induced osteogenic differentiation. 10.1371/journal.pone.0082436.g002Figure 2Estrogen-mediated synergistic effect on Wnt3A-stimulated ALP activity can be blocked by tamoxifen. (A) E2 dose-dependent synergy with Wnt3A in MPCs. Subconfluent iMEFs were infected with a fixed titer (MOI=5) of AdWnt3A or AdGFP, and treated with various concentrations of estradiol or DMSO. ALP activity was determinedusing a modified Great Escape SEAP chemiluminescence assay at the indicated time points (see Methods). D, DMSO solvent control; G, AdGFP control. (B) Wnt3A dose-dependent synergy with E2 in MPCs. Subconfluent iMEFs were infected with varied titers of AdWnt3A or AdGFP, and treated with estradiol (0.1μM) or DMSO. ALP activity was determined at the indicated time points. (C) ERα expression synergizes with Wnt3A in MPCs. The iMEFs were co-infected with AdWnt3A (MOI=3) or AdGFP (MOI=3) and varied titers of AdERα. ALP activity was determined at the indicated time points. (D) E2-induced synergy can be blocked by tamoxifen. The iMEFs were infected with AdWnt3A or AdGFP (MOI=3), and treated with estradiol (0.1μM) or DMSO in the presence or absence of tamoxifen (0 to 10μM). ALP activity was determined at day 5. (E) ERα-induced synergy can be blocked by tamoxifen. The iMEFs were co-infected with AdWnt3A or AdGFP and AdERα (MOI=3 each) in the presence or absence of tamoxifen (2.5 and 5μM). ALP activity was determined at day 5. All assay conditions were done in triplicate. “*”, p<0.05; “**”, p<0.01.Activation of ER signaling pathway synergizes with Wnt3A-induced late stage of osteogenic differentiation in MPCs We analyzed the effect of E2 stimulation and exogenous ERα expression on Wnt3A-induced late osteogenic marker and matrix mineralization. When Wnt3A-transduced iMEFs were treated 10-7M E2, the expression of late osteogenic markers osteocalcin (Figure 3A) and osteopontin (Figure 3B) was increased when compared with the Wnt3A alone groups, while E2 alone did not exert any significant effect. Similar results were also obtained when AdERα was used in the place of E2 stimulation (data not shown). 10.1371/journal.pone.0082436.g003Figure 3Activation of estrogen signaling synergizes with Wnt3A-induced late stage of osteogenic differentiation. (A) & (B) Estradiol synergizes with Wnt3A in induction of late osteogenic markers osteocalcin and osteopontin expression. Subconfluent iMEFs were infected with AdWnt3A (MOI=5) or AdGFP, and treated with estradiol (0.1μM) or DMSO. At day 10, cells were fixed and subjected to immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against osteocalcin (A) or osteopontin (B). Isotype IgG or no primary antibodies were used as negative controls (data not shown). Representative results are shown. (C) E2 enhances Wnt3A-induced matrix mineralization. The iMEF cells were treated as described in (A) and maintained in mineralization medium. At day 14, cells were fixed and subjected to Alizarin Red S staining. Macrographic images (a) and microscopic images (b) were recorded. Representative results are shown. We also analyzed the synergistic effect of E2 and Wnt3A on matrix mineralization, and found that E2 effectively enhanced Wnt3A-induced mineral nodule formation compared with the Wnt3A alone group (Figure 3C). Consistently with the findings from ALP studies, E2 stimulation alone did not result in any significant mineral nodule formation. These results further indicate that E2 stimulation could significantly enhanced Wnt3A-induced terminal osteogenic differentiation of MPCs. Estradiol treatment enhances the mean bone density and endochondral ossification in Wnt3A-treated mouse fetal limb explants To further test the synergistic effect of E2 and Wnt3A on bone formation, we used an ex vivo mouse fetal limb culture model. We and others have used such model to demonstrate the biological effects of several important osteogenic factors on bone formation and endochondral ossification [12,14,36]. The dissected mouse fetal forelimbs were effectively transduced with AdWnt3A (Figure 4A, panel a). Using fluorescence labeling dye calcein, we were able to trace the new bone formation (Figure 4, panel b). At the endpoint of assays the limb cultures were fixed and subjected to micro-CT scanning. We found that both Wnt3A and Wnt3A+E2 groups exhibited significantly higher mean bone density than that of the GFP+DMSO control (p<0.02 and p<0.01, respectively) (Figure 4B). There was a trend that Wnt3A+E2 group had higher mean bone density than that of Wnt3A alone group although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.06). Furthermore, the addition of tamoxifen nullified the significance between Wnt3A+E2 group and GFP+DMSO control group (Figure 4B). It is noteworthy that the GFP+E2 group exhibits higher mean bone density than that of the DMSO+GFP group’s although the difference is not statistically significant (p=0.09). Histologic analysis revealed that the resting and proliferating zones were reduced while the hypertrophic zone and ossification zone were expanded in Wnt3A+E2 treatment group (Figure 4C). Wnt3A group exhibits an expanded hypertrophic zone, and E2 alone did not significantly affect the growth plate (Figure 4C). These results suggest that the synergistic effect of Wnt3A and E2 may lead to accelerated endochondral ossification in the fetal limb culture model. 10.1371/journal.pone.0082436.g004Figure 4Estradiol enhances the bone density in Wnt3A-treated mouse fetal limb explants. (A) Mouse fetal limb explant culture and Wnt3A gene transfer. The skinned forelimbs of mouse embryos (E18.5) were dissected, and directly infected AdWnt3A, or AdGFP (a). At 24h after dissection, the limb explants were treated with estradiol (10-6M) or DMSO (n=5 each group). At day 7, calcein (100mM) was added to the medium. The cultured tissues were harvested on day 10 and soft tissues were removed (b). (B) The treated limb explants were subjected to fixed and subjected to μCT imaging. Mean bone density of was calculated. (C) H & E staining of the cultured limb explants. The cultured limb samples were decalcified, paraffin-embedded and subjected to H & E staining. The growth plate was indicated with boxes. Representative images are shown.Exogenous expression of ERα and Wnt3A synergistically induces ectopic bone formation We next tested the synergistic effect of ERα and Wnt3A on ectopic bone formation in vivo. The iMEFs were first transduced with AdWnt3A and AdERα, or AdGFP (Figure 5A), and the transduced cells were used for either subcutaneous injections or intramuscular injections of aythmic nude mice. Bony masses were found in the Wnt3A+GFP group and Wnt3A+ERα group, but not in GFP only or ERα+GFP group (Figure 5B). The retrieved masses were decalcified, paraffin-embedded and subjected to H & E staining. We found that in both subcutaneous and intramuscular injections, Wnt3A+ERα group formed more mature and thicker trabecular bone matrices than that of the Wnt3A alone group (Figure 5C). These in vivo results are consistent with the above-mentioned in vitro and ex vivo findings, and strongly suggest that activation of estrogen receptor α signaling may exhibit strong synergistic effect on canonical Wnt-induced osteogenic differentiation of MPCs although ERα signaling per se may not be sufficient to induce robust osteogenic differentiation of MPCs. 10.1371/journal.pone.0082436.g005Figure 5ERα and Wnt3A synergistically induce ectopic bone formation.

(B) The transduced cells described in (A) were collected and injected into athymic nude mice subcutaneously and intramuscularly. Ectopic bony masses were harvested after 6 weeks.

The retrieved masses were decalcified, paraffin-embedded and subjected to H & E staining.

Utilizing the commonly-used Tcf/β-catenin reporter pTop-Luc, we tested a broad range of concentrations of E2 for its effect on pTop-Luc reporter activity. As shown in Figure 6A, E2 stimulation did not significantly affect the reporter activity, and furthermore, E2 stimulation did not act synergistically on Wnt3A-induced reporter activity, suggesting that estrogen signaling may not act as an upstream regulator of canonical Wnt pathway in MPCs. 10.1371/journal.pone.0082436.g006Figure 6Wnt3A upregulates ERα, but not ERβ, expression at the early stage in MPCs. (A) Estradiol does not affect Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity. Subconfluent iMEFs were transfected with the Tcf/β-catenin reporter TOP-Luc, and infected with AdWnt3A or AdGFP, and then treated with varied concentrations of estradiol. Luciferase activity was measured at 48h post treatment. Each assay condition was done in triplicate. (B) Wnt3A upregulates ERα expression in MPCs. Subconfluent iMEFs were infected with AdWnt3A or AdGFP. Total RNA was collected at 24h, 48h, and 72h after infection and subjected to RT-PCR analysis using primers specific for mouse ERα, ERβ, Aromatase, and Hsd17b4. All samples were normalized with GAPDH expression level. Representative results are sown. We further tested if Wnt signaling regulates ERα pathway in MPCs. We transduced iMEFs with AdWnt3A or AdGFP for 24h, 48h and 72h. The expression of ERα, ERβ, aromatase, and Hsd17b4 was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We found that ERα expression was up-regulated by Wnt3A at 24h and 48h, but returned to baseline at 72h (Figure 6B). Interestingly, the expression of ERβ was significantly down-regulated at 24h upon Wnt3A stimulation, and gradually returned to base level after 48h (Figure 6B). The expression of aromatase (also known as estrogen synthase or CYP19), an enzyme responsible for a key step in the biosynthesis of estrogens, was biphasic, up-regulated at 24h but reduced after 48h, upon Wnt3A stimulation, indicating that there may be a feedback inhibition mechanism (Figure 6B). Lastly, we examined the expression of Hsd17b4 gene that encodes an enzyme involved in peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation and catalyzes the oxidation of estradiol with high preference over the reduction of estrone [57]. We found that Hsd17b4 was slightly up-regulated at later time point (72h) (Figure 6B), suggesting Hsd17b4 expression may not be directly regulated by Wnt3A. Although the detailed mechanism underlying the ERα synergistic effect on Wnt3A-induced osteogenic differentiation remains to be fully elucidated, our findings strongly suggest that the signaling crosstalk and synergy of the two pathways should be further explored as potential novel approach to combating bone and skeletal disorders, such as osteoporosis.Discussion Both estrogen and canonical Wnt signaling pathways play an important role in regulating bone development and bone hemostasis. Here we investigate the possible crosstalk and synergy of the two pathways in regulating osteogenic differentiation of MPCs. Through either the administration of E2 or exogenous expression of ERα in MPCs, we find that the activation of estrogen receptor signaling synergistically enhances Wnt3A-induced both early and late osteogenic markers, as well as matrix mineralization. The E2 or ERα-mediated synergy can be effectively blocked by ERα antagonist tamoxifen. E2 stimulation on Wnt3A-transduced mouse fetal limb explants leads to an expansion of hypertrophic chondrocyte zone and ossification and an increase in mean bone density. Ectopic bone formation via subcutaneous and intramuscular injections of Wnt3A and/or ERα-transduced MPCs reveals that ERα significantly enhances the maturity and mineralization of Wnt3A-induced ectopic bone masses, compared with Wnt3A treatment alone. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that E2 does not exert any detectable effect on Wnt/β-catenin reporter activity. However, ERα expression is up-regulated within the first 48h in AdWnt3A-transduced MPCs, whereas ERβ expression is significantly inhibited within 24h. Furthermore, the aromatase (also known as estrogen synthase, or Cyp19), a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of estrogens, exhibits a biphasic expression pattern, up-regulated at 24h but reduced after 48h, upon Wnt3A stimulation. Thus, our results demonstrate that estrogen signaling acts synergistically with Wnt3A in promoting osteogenic differentiation and suggest that Wnt3A may crosstalk with estrogen signaling by up-regulating ERα expression and down-regulating ERβ expression in MPCs. Our findings indicate that Wnt3A can regulate the expression of ERα and ERβ in an opposite fashion, which may be consistent with numerous reports about the antagonist relationship between the two receptors [28-30]. The biological actions of estrogens are mediated by estrogen binding to ERα or ERβ. Mice lacking ERα, or ERβ, or both has revealed that both receptor subtypes have overlapping but distinct functions in estrogen-dependent action in vivo [31-33]. ERα and ERβ have different transcriptional activities under different ligand, cell-type, and promoter contexts. Both receptors can form functional heterodimers although the biological roles of ERα /β heterodimers are unknown. When co-expressed, ERβ inhibits ERα-mediated gene expression and in many instances opposes the actions of ERα [31-33], although the role of ERα in osteoblast lineage cells has remained elusive. A recent study indicated that ERα in osteoblast progenitors expressing Osterix1 (Osx1) potentiates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, leading to an increase in proliferation and differentiation of periosteal cells and the optimal cortical bone accrual at the periosteum in mice [58]. However, this ERα function does not require estrogens. It was reported that ERα may directly interact with β-catenin in human colon and breast cancer cells [59]. However, it may require further investigation about the direct feature of the interaction because a polycomb group protein EZH2 was also shown to interact directly with both ERα and β-catenin, thus connecting the estrogen and Wnt signaling circuitries in breast and prostate cancer cells [60]. It remains to be determined if ERα and β-catenin directly interact each other in MPCs and osteoblast progenitor cells. Nonetheless, it was reported that, in osteoblastic ROS 17/2.8 cells and primary osteoblast cells, Wnt/β-catenin signaling was a component of osteoblastic cell early responses to load-bearing and its effectiveness required ERα [61]. In MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells, estrogen receptor and Wnt signaling were shown to interact to regulate early gene expression in response to mechanical strain [62]. It was shown that E2 sensitized the effect on mechanically induced Cox-2 expression, which could be abolished using the anti-estrogen ICI182780. However, mechanical strain in the presence of Wnt signaling activators diminished both the E2 sensitizing effect and the stimulatory effect of Wnt signaling in the absence of strain [62]. A more recent study focused on the role of ERα in osteoblast lineage cells by deleting ERα at different stages of differentiation in murine osteoblast lineage cells [58]. It was found that ERα in osterix1-positive osteoblast progenitors potentiates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, thereby increasing proliferation and differentiation of periosteal cells although this function did not require estrogens [58]. Thus, the molecular mechanism underlying the interplay between estrogen signaling and Wnt/β-catenin pathway remains to be thoroughly elucidated. In summary, we investigate the possible crosstalk and synergy between ER signaling and canonical Wnt signaling in regulating osteogenic differentiation of MPCs. Our results demonstrate that the activation of ER signaling via estradiol and exogenously expressed ERα in MPCs synergistically enhances Wnt3A-induced both early and late osteogenic markers, as well as matrix mineralization. The E2 or ERα-mediated synergy can be effectively blocked by tamoxifen. E2 stimulation enhances endochondral ossification of Wnt3A-transduced mouse fetal limb explants. Exogenously expressed ERα in MPCs significantly enhances the maturity and mineralization of Wnt3A-induced ectopic bone masses. Mechanistically, we show that Wnt3A up-regulates the expression of ERα and aromatase but down-regulates ERβ expression in MPCs. It is conceivable that the signaling crosstalk and synergy between the ER signaling and Wnt/β-catenin pathways may be further explored as potential novel approach to combating bone and skeletal disorders, such as osteoporosis.Supporting InformationTable S1 Oligonucleotides for cloning and RT-PCR.

Introduction Living organisms are built of interacting components, whose function and dysfunction can be described through dynamic network models (Davidson et al, 2002). Systems Biology involves the iterative construction of such models (Ideker et al, 2001), and may eventually improve the understanding of diseases using in silico simulations. Such simulations may eventually permit drugs to be prioritized for clinical trials, reducing potential risks and increasing the likelihood of successful outcomes. Owing to the staggering complexity of biological systems, efforts to model them require large and diverse sets of data on connections between components and responses to system perturbations. Among the most advanced models are those developed for baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Zhang et al, 2005), which are built upon protein–DNA (Lee et al, 2002) and protein–protein (Ho et al, 2002) associations, supplemented by correlated changes in gene expression (Hughes et al, 2000) or protein abundances (Gygi et al, 1999) under differing conditions. Information gleaned from targeted synergies, such as paired mutations (Tong et al, 2004) and gene–drug interactions (Parsons et al, 2004), have proven to be especially useful for revealing functional connections between components. Chemical combinations also show promise, and a proliferation experiment with yeast mutants in the presence of probe mixtures (Haggarty et al, 2003) has found that chemical profiles correlate with genetic similarity. This potential is confirmed by recent experiments using antibacterial combinations (Yeh et al, 2006) that show a relationship between synergy and chemical target relatedness. Combination responses to varying concentrations of compounds provide a more detailed look at synergistic perturbations. Combination therapies have been used increasingly over the past century, and comprehensive reviews (Berenbaum, 1989; Greco et al, 1995) describe the experimental designs and combination analyses employed. Combinations of two or more agents can be tested using either exhaustive or efficient designs (Carter and Wampler, 1986), and the most widely used is the factorial design (also ‘checkerboard' or ‘dose matrix') where combinations are tested in all possible permutations of serially diluted single agent doses (Figure 1). A dose-matrix experiment comprehensively samples the underlying response surface with few assumptions about its shape. We have previously reported an approach for high-throughput dose-matrix screening of chemical combinations (Borisy et al, 2003; Keith et al, 2005; Zimmermann et al, 2007) in cell-based assays that preserve disease-relevant biological connections. Such screens yield a variety of response surfaces, with distinct shapes for combinations that work through different known mechanisms, suggesting that combination effects may contain information on the nature of functional connections between drug targets. The past study of drug combinations has focused mainly on the question of whether a combination is more potent than equally effective doses of its constituents (Greco et al, 1995). Synergy over this level is especially important when justifying clinical uses, as it defines the point at which the combination can provide additional benefit over simply increasing the dose of either agent. This most widely used dose additivity model (Loewe, 1928) represents the expected response if both agents are actually the same compound. In that case, a slice through the response surface at any chosen iso-effect level (or ‘isobole') should show a linear relationship between the doses of the two agents. For example, if 50% inhibition (I=T/U for treated and untreated samples) is achieved separately by 1 μM of drug A or 2 μM of drug B, a combination of 0.5 μM of A and 1 μM of B should also inhibit by 50%. Formally, the response at combined concentrations X,Y is the inhibition ILoewe that satisfies (X/XI)+(Y/YI)=1, where XI and YI are the single agent effective concentrations that produce ILoewe. Deviations from Loewe additivity are usually quantified using the combination index (Chou and Talalay, 1983) CI=(X/XI)+(Y/YI), which is essentially a ratio of total effective drug dose (combination versus single agents) required to achieve a given effect level. Loewe additivity is experimentally demanding because determining the effective concentrations requires well-sampled single agent curves. Moreover, the dose-additive constraint is not in closed form; so Loewe additive response surfaces generally must be computed using iterative root finding (Berenbaum, 1985). The other frequently used reference model is Bliss independence (Bliss, 1939), which is the expectation (multiplicative probabilities) for independent yet competing elimination agents, like bullets aimed at a limited set of targets. For inhibitions, IMult=IX+IY–IXIY, where IX and IY are the single agent inhibition levels at concentrations X and Y. Although this model is of questionable relevance to drugs in biological settings, Bliss independence has often been favoured because it can be directly calculated from minimally sampled experiments without single agent response curve interpolation or iterative root finding. A third useful reference is the highest single agent (HSA) model, or Gaddum's non-interaction (Berenbaum, 1989), where the expected combination effect is simply the maximum of the single agent responses at corresponding concentrations. The relationship between combination effects and drug mechanism has been intuitively recognized for some time, but attempts to theoretically model this association (Ashford and Cobby, 1974; Harrap and Jackson, 1975; Jackson, 1993) have proven problematic. These studies simulated a branched metabolic pathway as a system of linked ordinary differential equations, and the final reaction velocity was calculated in response to varying concentrations of inhibitors targeting different modelled enzymes. Synergy over Loewe additivity was assessed for each pair of enzyme inhibitors by computing simulated dose matrices and reporting the smallest combination index at 50% inhibition. However, these efforts could not unambiguously predict synergy or antagonism, because it was possible to generate any combination index for most inhibitor pairs by varying one or more of the many kinetic parameters in the pathway model. We approached the problem by focusing not just on the presence or absence of synergy relative to some reference level, but by using a set of shape models to characterize the morphology of full response surfaces. Here we show that there is a clear relationship between dose-matrix response shape for a combination and the connectivity of its targets (the type of connection between them), using simulated pathways and combination experiments. The simulations were used to define a reference set of shape models that represent connectivity-related responses, and the experiments demonstrated that the shapes predicted by the simulations do indeed occur in biological settings. We also use the data to show that the synergy profile produced by a drug across many combinations in a screen depends on the drug's mechanism, and can also be used to infer connectivity relationships between drug targets.Results We considered four models for combination effect morphology (Figure 2 and Materials and methods) that reflect historical combination analyses and that represent many of the responses observed in our therapeutic combination screens. The HSA model describes a simple superposition of the single agent curves. Loewe additivity (Loewe, 1928) is the drug-with-itself reference to represent dose-additive pairings. The ‘Bliss boosting' model extends Bliss Independence (Bliss, 1939) to allow variable boosts in effect at high concentrations. Finally, the ‘Potentiation' model describes combinations like Bactrim® (Figure 1), where one agent's curve is shifted with a power-law slope and superposed on the enhancer's own activity. These models are not an optimally designed basis set of shape descriptors because they are not orthogonal (they produce degenerate, or indistinguishable, shapes for some parameter settings), and also are not complete, in that some observed surfaces do not fit any of them. Nevertheless, this set does cover many of the observed effects in our therapeutic screens, and permits a quantitative exploration of different synergy types. Each observed dose matrix can be analysed by fitting all the shape models to the data by means of least-squares minimization across any free parameters, and determining which shape models produce consistent fits. It is also useful to calculate a volume VHSA between the data and the HSA surface, normalized to the concentration sampling, to characterize the overall strength of combination effects.Simulations of metabolic pathways We used numerical simulations of metabolic pathways to show that pairs of targets with differing connectivity produce distinct combination effects (Figure 3). We constructed a branched, unregulated pathway of linked Michaelis–Menten reactions (Supplementary 1), and computed the inhibition of final reaction velocity after applying varying concentrations of paired competitive enzymatic inhibitors (affecting Km). Each pair of inhibitors was applied repeatedly over a dosing matrix, and we determined the response morphology by fitting our shape models to each simulated dose matrix, and finding which shape provided the best match over the whole surface (Figure 3). We found that when both inhibitors targeted the same enzyme, Loewe additive surfaces were produced as expected. When the inhibitors had separate targets within this pathway, the resulting surfaces were best fit by Bliss boosting, with differing levels depending on the target connectivity. These differences in combination effect were robust to plausible variations of the simulated pathway that did not affect the network topology. Random perturbations of up to two orders of magnitude in all the reaction parameters recovered the original best-fit shapes (Supplementary Figure S2), suggesting that the response morphology is affected by only such extreme changes in kinetic parameters that alter the network topology. Similar Monte Carlo simulations perturbing specific parameter classes or individual enzymes showed no strong sensitivities to particular kinetic parameters or targets for this pathway (Supplementary 3). Converting the inhibitors to non-competitive (affecting Vm) kinetics likewise recovered the original best-fit shapes, altering mainly the single agent curves. An exception is that unbypassed serial combinations (e.g., R1xR6; Figure 3) yielded HSA-like responses for non-competitive inhibitors (Supplementary 2). Adjusting the end point to something more like proliferation by means of an exponential transform (see Materials and methods) distorted the resulting boost levels, but still did not change which shape model was preferred. All of these factors could strongly affect the single agent curves (e.g., potency, steepness, and limiting efficacy) but the best-fit shape model for each simulated combination effect was very stable to perturbation. Introducing regulation by negative feedback did have strong effects on the combination responses. Pathway B was added to investigate synergy across pathways and to predict effects for sterol biosynthesis. Whereas inhibitors with serially placed targets in an unregulated linear pathway produced multiplicative boosts, enclosing such targets in a negative feedback loop yielded strong potentiation (although like unregulated serial inhibitors, these yield weaker effects for non-competitive inhibitors). The synergies under negative feedback are not immediately intuitive (Supplementary Figure S3) and an analytical derivation of the simulated power-law potentiation for this model would be challenging, underscoring that simulation is the most practical means for deriving even the simplest emergent properties of complex systems. Another change affecting topology is to alter the type of junctions in a pathway. For the branches in Pathway A, the reaction could proceed down either side to the end point; so parallel pairs of inhibitors across these junctions (e.g., R3 with R5) are functionally analogous to logical OR operations. Inhibiting across such OR junctions produced saturating Bliss responses in our simulations. Replacing such junctions with functional AND operations (here implemented by pairing targets across Pathway A and Pathway B, both required for RAB) resulted in masking surfaces (close to HSA or Bliss masking) for combinations that straddled the junction. Such masking effects were produced even for cross-pathway combinations involving R11 and R12, which are bypassed in Pathway B to ensure clear distinctions between masking, multiplicative, and saturating boosts. The best-fit shapes for all the combinations in both simulated pathways are summarized in Figure 4, using symbols whose size reflects the HSA volume and where the colour and symbol denote the best-fit model. The ambiguity between the shape models for each combination is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S4. In these simulations, the fitted shapes clearly correspond to distinct mechanistic configurations. It is notable that all the cross-pathway combinations produced either HSA surfaces or other masking surfaces with weaker combination effects (with ∣VHSA∣∼1, between the measured effect and the HSA model surface) than are seen within each of the pathways (∣VHSA∣∼3–10). These simulations suggest specific hypotheses in terms of our shape models for experimental combinations of chemical inhibitors of metabolic pathways. Agents sharing a primary target should, of course, produce Loewe additive responses. Branched unregulated pathways should produce various levels of Bliss boosting, depending on the target connectivity, and linear pathways regulated by negative feedback should show power-law potentiation. Combinations with targets that cross between such pathways are likely to produce masking effects (similar to the HSA model or Bliss masking).Yeast combinations experiment To test some of the hypotheses from our simulations, we undertook a chemical combination screen focused on the sterol metabolism in yeast. This pathway is very well characterized with known inhibitors at a number of enzymes (Wills et al, 2000), and is regulated by negative feedback (Gardner et al, 2001). We selected 10 antifungal drugs (Table I), six with targets along a linear section of the pathway and four targeting other cellular functions. Because sterol biosynthesis is much the same across yeast species (Wills et al, 2000), we selected Candida glabrata, a frequent focus of antifungal treatment that we had used in past therapeutic screens, and measured proliferation using a metabolic assay (Materials and methods). After determining single agent activities for all the drugs, we designed dose-matrix experiments with concentration samples centred on each drug's effective concentration at 50% effect (EC50) when possible. The dose-matrix responses for each combination are presented in Figure 5 and Supplementary 4. The combination effects are visible towards the top right-hand corner of each response surface, especially between the sterol pathway inhibitors. Some of the single agents produced variable responses, and this is most obvious for those drug-with-itself dose matrices along the diagonal of the grid which show only one side appearing to be active. The self-combination of rapamycin illustrates how a spurious synergy can arise from instability in the measured potency of a drug, and the apparent synergy of miconazole and itraconazole shows evidence of single agent instability—its inhibition errors are exceptionally large, indicating inconsistency between the replicate blocks. Much more striking are the synergies between sterol inhibitors, which span a greater range of concentrations and which recapitulate the known antifungal synergy between statins and azoles (Lorenz and Parks, 1990). The shape and magnitude of each combination effect is summarized by symbols whose size represents the total synergy (as measured by VHSA) and whose colour denotes the best-fit shape model. Degeneracies between the models are measured by the comparative chi-squared (χ2) goodness-of-fit estimates (Supplementary 4 and Supplementary Figure S5). Although the data quality did not permit a clear distinction between the HSA model and Loewe additivity, the two most similar models in the set, most of the drug pairs sharing the same targets and agent-with-self combinations produced responses that were consistent with Loewe additivity. The exceptions all had relatively weak synergy, with only one, Itraconazole with Miconazole, exceeding the estimated systematic error level (VHSA>1; see Materials and methods). By contrast, all but one of the cross-target sterol combinations exceeded that level, and all produced surfaces that were best fit by potentiation. Across pathways, the combination effects were more variable, and strong synergies (VHSA>1; see Materials and methods) were relatively rare (5/28 versus 10/22 for same pathway), with an ∼8% Poisson probability (Press et al, 1997, §14.3.3). The observed effects confirm predictions from our pathway simulations. We expected same-target combinations to produce Loewe additivity and cross-target sterol pairings to give rise to potentiation. Among the 11 same-target and 11 cross-target sterol combinations tested, the prediction accuracy is only 54% if we insist on unambiguously correct shape classifications (the predicted model has χ2min, and Δχ2>χ2min for the next best fit). However, almost all the failures are due to the degeneracy of the models for HSA-like combinations. If we count as a success any surface whose best fit was indistinguishable from the predicted shape, with Δχ2<χ2min, the prediction accuracy rises to 72% with an uncertainty of ∼22% due to the sample size, assuming Poisson statistics within each confusion matrix class. Across pathways, the relative diversity of combination effects makes sense, because their target connectivities are probably more varied, and the relative rarity of strong synergies accords with the predominantly masking effects in our simulated cross-pathway combinations.Combination screen in human tumour cells There is further support for our simulations from a prior combination screen aimed at discovering potential combination therapeutics. Human tumour cells (HCT116) were tested using a proliferation assay for responses to all pairwise combinations of 90 drugs and probes, most with known mechanism (Supplementary 5). This screen provides a broader sampling of possible target connectivities than had our C. glabrata experiment, and permits us to investigate the applicability of our shape models to cellular signalling networks. Because this screen had been designed for discovering potent synergies, a four-fold dilution factor had been used (compared to two-fold for our yeast experiment), and many compounds were either inactive alone or had not been sampled far above their EC50 concentrations, often obscuring distinctions between fitted shape models. Nevertheless, we expect strong potency shifts to be nearly always detectable, and other shape classes can be distinguished when the single agents have been appropriately sampled. For each combination, we obtained an HSA volume VHSA and best-fit shapes as described above. We also examined ‘synergy profiles' constructed from each agent's VHSA values across all the other probes, and recorded the correlation coefficient between the synergy profiles for each pair of drugs in the screen. Each pair of drugs was classified by target relatedness, using the known target annotations (Supplementary 5), as ‘Identical' for drug-with-itself, ‘Same' for drugs sharing a target, ‘Related' for pairs with distinct targets in the same pathway or function, ‘Different' for pairs targeting distinct functions, and ‘Unknown' for pairs involving at least one uncharacterized drug. Inter-kinase combinations were classified separately as ‘Kinases'. Supplementary 6 presents the resulting scores and correlations for all the tested combinations, and Supplementary 7 shows their distributions grouped by target similarity. The shape models in Figure 2 provide reasonable coverage of the observed combination effects. Only ∼30% of 4092 drug pairs in the screen produced a formally acceptable fit (χ2min<2) to any of the models (Supplementary 7a). However, given the systematic errors produced by the experimental process (Materials and methods), a more fair assessment of the uncertainties can be obtained by examining the χ2 distribution of the Loewe additive model for the 87 drug-with-self combinations, as a negative control set. These ‘Identical' combinations have a median additive χ2∼9, suggesting that the uncertainties are roughly three times larger than the formal estimates from replicate dose matrices, due to systematic errors that were not accounted for by the scatter between replicates. Adopting this χ2 level as more representative of the errors extends the coverage (χ2min<18) of our models to most of the screen, leaving only ∼10%, which are dominated by those combinations that are equally inconsistent with all four models. For an analysis of the observed shape distributions, we selected a set of ‘optimally sampled' combinations, where at least two concentration samples had been tested above the EC50 for both single agents, enabling distinctions between strong combination effect shapes. Among these 253 combinations, ∼60% fit masking models (HSA, additive, or Bliss masking), ∼30% were best fit by potentiation, with the remaining ∼10% accounted for by multiplicative or saturating Bliss boosts. These proportions hold even for the 91 optimal combinations with sub-saturated single agent activities (Emax<90%), for which masking and multiplicative effects would be clearly distinguishable. For all target connectivity groupings, the optimally sampled combinations were dominated by masking and potentiation effects. Across the whole screen, combination effects and synergy profile correlations (Figure 6A and B) support the trends observed in our pathway simulations and the C. glabrata experiment. When we examined synergy score distributions (Supplementary 7), we found that drug pairs targeting different pathways or involving unknown targets had significantly more variable scores (Materials and methods) with a slight trend to lower synergy levels. The synergy profile correlations show a more striking trend. Pairs with the same or related targets ought to have similar connectivities with the rest of the set, because they are likely to have similar mechanistic relationships to the rest of the drug targets in the screen. Indeed there are significant differences between the profile correlation distributions with a stronger trend towards increasing correlation with target similarity. The responses to pairings of kinase inhibitors also provide support for an association between combination effects and connectivity. Whereas combinations between kinases in general had similar distributions to those for other related target pairs, combinations between drugs targeting the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C (PKC), or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathways (Table II) showed exceptionally strong synergies and correlations. HCT116 cells maintain an activating KRAS mutation that drives cellular growth and survival (Shirasawa et al, 1993), and are especially reliant upon epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated signalling for proliferation (Awwad et al, 2003). Because these pathways are central to EGFR signalling and interconnected (Schlessinger, 2004), we would expect HCT116 cells to be very sensitive to these combinations, and that inhibitors of those pathways should have similar synergy profiles. Moreover, the combination effects between the pathways show differences (Figure 6C) that are consistent across mechanistic replicates, despite limited concentration sampling and evidence of secondary target activity. Such differences may eventually provide novel insights into how these pathways interact in the context of HCT116 proliferation (e.g., that the MAPK/PKC connection may be less direct than the other target pairings).Discussion The simulations and experiments presented here add a new dimension to earlier studies investigating the effects of multiple perturbations to biological systems. Early studies of statistical epistatic associations between random mutagenesis and chemical stresses (Elena and Lenski, 1997; Kishony and Leibler 2003) were followed by systematic studies of mutant libraries in combination with chemical probes (Giaever et al, 2004; Lum et al, 2004; Parsons et al, 2004) and synergies between targeted chemical probes (Haggarty et al, 2003; Yeh et al, 2006). This study explores the additional information available from variable dose response matrices, and relates quantitative combination effects, as measured response shape classification or by HSA volumes, to target connectivity. We use the term ‘connectivity' to capture both the distance and topology of the connection between the targets, rather than the more common ‘interaction' (Parsons et al, 2004), denoting the presence of a functional connection. Our pathway simulations show that biological systems are expected to produce a useful variety of combination effects that are correlated with connectivity, and our experimental results demonstrate that the simulations are biologically relevant and predictive. There was only partial consistency between specific chemical synergies in our yeast experiment and corresponding interactions observed in earlier genetic screens (Supplementary 8). The observed synergies between sterol inhibitors are reflected in homozygous synthetic lethalities (Stark et al, 2006) that are internal to the pathway, and rapamycin's synergy with terbinafine agrees with the reported interaction between TOR1 and ERG1. However, the mutant screen of caspofungin's target, FKS1, showed no correlation with our combination effects. Moreover, there is little correspondence between our results and the cross-activities identified in drug sensitivity screens of heterozygous yeast mutants (Giaever et al, 2004; Lum et al, 2004; Parsons et al, 2004). The mixed results of these comparisons are not very surprising. Aside from experimental errors (see Materials and methods), some of the disagreement can be ascribed to the quantitative nature of dose-matrix response data, because the responses to varying doses (Hartman and Tippery, 2004), or even time-resolved experiments (Warringer et al, 2003), can detect the effects of non-essential genes that would have been missed in lethality screens. Another contribution may come from likely differences between genetic and protein networks (Ozier et al, 2003). Chemical combinations can interfere directly with protein interactions without mediation through gene expression, and although the protein and gene networks are intertwined, connectivity differences between the two types of targets should be expected. There was more agreement between our simulation results and a prior flux balance analysis (FBA) of the yeast metabolic network (Segrè et al, 2005) in response to paired mutations. The simulated mutations should correspond roughly to the high-concentration limit of our dose matrices. Both approaches predict strong synergies (synthetic lethality) when the system is inhibited across parallel alternative pathways, and find masking effects (buffering) when unrelated pathways are impaired, provided that the two pathways are not competing for a common supply of precursors (Supplementary Figure S2 in Segrè et al). The main difference is that the FBA simulations produced more multiplicative than masking pairings, especially for cross-pathway combinations. This may be due to the partial view of combination effects provided by the epistasis scores (Supplementary Figure S1), or to an implicit assumption, in the FBA simulations, that competition for the same metabolic ingredients is widespread. The masking responses found in our cross-pathway simulations are supported experimentally, by the weaker synergy levels seen in our C. glabrata experiment, and by the large fraction of masking effects (∼60%) in both the HCT116 screen and prior antibacterial combination experiments (Yeh et al, 2006). Thus the dose-matrix response shapes and synergy profiles from systematic combination screens can provide valuable new insights into network connectivity. A possible application in chemical genetics would be to extend phenotypic profiling for mechanism inference (Perlman et al, 2004; Macdonald et al, 2006), using combinations effectively as extra assays. Query drugs with unknown targets could have their synergy profiles compared to a previously assembled profile library for a diverse set of chemical probes. The known targets for those probes whose profiles correlate most closely with a query drug's are likely candidates for the drug's mechanism. For constructing biological network models, observed combination effects can be compared to expectations from target connectivity through existing protein interaction networks, and inconsistencies can be used to improve the models by means of a prediction-validation procedure (Ideker et al, 2001). Combining chemicals is much simpler than the process of constructing double mutant strains, and chemical combinations can yield detailed information about connections between proteins that are not accessible to single agents or mutagenesis, enabling the study of disease networks like those involved in cancer (Schoeberl et al, 2002) and inflammation (Bouwmeester et al, 2004) signalling. Of course, there are limitations to this approach for probing biological networks. The collection of full dose matrices is expensive, and will necessitate a trade-off between the added information obtained from response shapes and the loss of assay fidelity from the use of high-throughput measurements (e.g., single time points for growth rather than time-resolved growth curves). The mechanistic information that can be extracted will depend strongly on the generality and specificity of the set of shape models being used. The four models presented here represent only a subset of the observed responses, and the pathway simulations sampled only a small minority of possible target connectivities. Even with more extensive simulations, there will certainly be mechanistic degeneracies associated with each distinct response shape. For example, it will probably be possible to produce potentiation like that seen in Bactrim using several distinct target configurations. Thus, response shapes cannot be used to uniquely define combination mechanisms, but merely to exclude inconsistent connections. Finally, chemical probes often have poorly characterized mechanisms or multiple targets, and combination screens will have to account for this by covering biological targets with several chemically distinct probes. Despite all these limitations, the present study has shown that even with a limited set of shape models, dose-matrix data can provide useful connectivity information. The results of this initial exploration suggest several directions for expanding the response surface approach to combination analysis. First, it is essential to extend the current shape model set by using more comprehensive simulations of larger networks. The most obvious way to do this would be to define a basis set that represents simple observed network connectivities, including serial and parallel arrangements, bifurcations, both AND and OR junctions, and some regulation mechanisms (Milo et al, 2002). Combination responses from pathway simulations covering the connectivity basis could then be used to define shape models for comparison with simulated responses for larger networks, as well as with experimental data. Another approach would be to systematically explore perturbations of an existing biological network, such as S. cerevisiae metabolism (Famili et al, 2003), and to model drug inhibition by partially restricting the reaction rates at metabolic enzymes, essentially the Segrè et al's FBA for partial inhibitors. The challenge with this approach would be to identify meaningful connectivity measures that correlate with simulated synergy types. A third very promising area for future exploration is higher order combinations. The emergence of resistance to treatment for afflictions like cancer (Fojo and Bates, 2003) can be effectively addressed by combinations of three or more drugs (Komarova and Wodarz, 2005). Combination approaches can also offer improved control by perturbing multiple components of the disease network (Csermely et al, 2004), and higher order combinations should provide yet more details on mechanistic connections between their targets. The response surface approach presented here can be readily adapted to three or more drugs, as can the specific shape models shown in Figure 2, and a metabolic FBA of higher order combinations should provide important insights into the effectiveness of multi-target treatments. Finally, because the simulated combination responses were insensitive to the reaction details, this methodology may even be extendable to non-biological network problems where responses to targeted perturbations can be measured (Milo et al, 2002).Materials and methodsCombination response shape models Experimental dose-matrix responses include both potency shifts, where a combination alters the apparent potency of the single agents, and efficacy boosts, where the joint effect exceeds levels possible for either of the constituents. Many of these responses can be described by simple models that use the single agent curves to predict the combination effect (Figure 2), and whose parameters provide quantitative measures. Strong potency shifts relative to a simple HSA surface can be described using a power-law potentiation model, and efficacy boosts are quantifiable using a model that extends Bliss Independence (Bliss, 1939) to variable combination effect levels at high concentration. These models are expressed in terms of inhibitions, but can be adapted to other types of measurement, or for combinations involving more than two perturbing agents, without altering their qualitative properties. The shapes presented are not a complete orthogonal set covering all expected combination responses, but were chosen to represent some of the variety seen in our therapeutic screens, as well as to reflect historical reference models used in the literature. The HSA model, or Gaddum's non-interaction (Berenbaum, 1989), is based simply on the intuition that if a combination's effect exceeds those of its constituents, there must be some interaction. Mathematically, the HSA model is a superposition of the single agent curves where, at any combined concentration (X,Y), the inhibition IHSA=max(IX,IY), where IX and IY are effects produced by the single agents at (X,0) and (0,Y). The model values are calculated at each dose-matrix point, where IX and IY were determined using sigmoidal fits to the single agent response data. The volume VHSA=ΣX,Yln fX ln fY(Idata−IHSA) between the data and the HSA surface, adjusted for variable dilution factors fX, fY, can be readily calculated and provides a practical overall measure of synergy (in units of inhibition), summed over dimensionless log-concentration space. We also considered Loewe additivity (Loewe, 1928), the drug-with-itself standard. At each combined concentration (X,Y), we used an iterative approach (Berenbaum, 1985) to find the inhibition ILoewe that satisfies (X/XI)+(Y/YI)=1, where XI and YI are the single agent effective concentrations. Starting with a guess that I=IHSA, we interpolated the single agent curves to find XI,YI that produce I, calculated the corresponding combination index, and used bisection (Press et al, 1997) to converge on a value of I with combination index CI=1. Loewe additivity reduces to HSA at concentrations that are very different from XI,YI, as well as for I above an agent's limiting activity (effectively XI,YI → ∞). To model boosts in efficacy at high concentrations different from what the single agents can achieve, we used a ‘Bliss boosting' model, adapting the Bliss independence model (Bliss, 1939) for boost levels other than multiplicative. Mathematically, IBliss=IX+IY+(β−Emin)(IX IY/EX EY), where Emin is the lesser of EX and EY, the limiting single agent efficacies. The one free parameter β, in units of effect, determines the amount of boosting above Emax, the greater of the single agent efficacies. For inhibition effects, there are a number of useful reference levels: β=−Emax produces ‘cancelling', with zero effect at high concentration; β=Emin−Emax is ‘suppressing', where the less effective agent prevails; β=0 yields ‘masking', where the more effective agent prevails; β=Emin(1−Emax) is multiplicative (Bliss independence); and β=(1−Emax) produces ‘saturating' at 100% inhibition. At the high concentration limit, the suppressing, masking, multiplicative, and saturating levels correspond to ‘suppression', ‘buffering', ‘no epistasis', and ‘synthetic lethal' in recent classifications for epistasis (Elena and Lenski, 1997; Segrè et al, 2005; Yeh et al, 2006). Bliss boosting can be used in this form for any type of effect measure provided that the single agent responses increase monotonically with concentration. Only the saturating and multiplicative reference levels need to be adjusted according to the measurement scale. For example, if we consider fitness ratios (treated over untreated growth ratios) with f=ln(T/U) in place of inhibitions, there is no saturating level and β=Emin indicates multiplicative. Note that Bliss masking is similar to both HSA and Loewe additivity for very high or very low concentrations where the single agent effects are almost flat. Finally, we used a power-law ‘potentiation' model to describe strong shifts in potency similar to that seen for Bactrim® (Figure 1). For such combinations, an active single agent's response curve shows an increase in potency as the enhancer is titrated in, which is seen as linear iso-effect contours in serially diluted dose matrices (logarithmic concentration space). The inhibition IPotent=max(IX(C), IY), where IX(C) is the single agent response curve of the potentiated compound, at a shifted concentration C=X[1+(Y/Ypot)∣p∣]sign(p), where sign(p) is a unit sign function evaluated at (−1, 0, +1) corresponding to the sign of its argument. Although the functional form presented here is awkward, it was the simplest way we could find to achieve power-law potentiation and depotentiation above a threshold enhancer concentration, with the enhancer's own activity superimposed. The two free parameters for this model are the threshold concentration Ypot above which potentiation takes effect, and the potentiation slope p (synergy for positive and antagonism for negative p). There is no potentiation for p=0, where this model reduces to an HSA surface. Just as for HSA and Loewe additivity, the form of this model is identical for any type of effect measure. These models are not orthogonal; so we defined a fitting order to ensure an unambiguous choice. The shape models have degeneracies where two or more models can describe similar response shapes. Loewe additivity and HSA, for example, are largely degenerate, in that only when the single agents increase slowly over the sampled concentrations can a distinction between the two models be made. Nevertheless, both can be readily distinguished from Bliss boosting and potentiation, which themselves are distinct over a large range of their parameters, and many observed surfaces fit only one model effectively (Supplementary 2). To ensure an unambiguous choice that applies the principle of Occam's razor when fitting several models to an observed surface, we ordered them by increasing complexity (HSA, Loewe, Bliss, potentiation) and declared as best fit the first model that was consistent with the observed surface. Within Bliss boosting, we classified combinations as cancelling, suppressing, masking, multiplicative, or saturating, depending on which fell closest to the best-fit β for the observed response shape. Note that for some pairings, the boost levels cannot be separated. For example, if one single agent reaches 100% inhibition at high concentration, it will be impossible to distinguish saturating from multiplicative or masking levels. If both single agents reach 100%, only cancelling effects will be distinguishable from the others. For such boost level degeneracies, the first consistent level in the sequence above was chosen. We note that these models were used primarily to characterize response surface shapes. Indeed, of the four shape models discussed here, only Loewe additivity has an a priori physical foundation as a predictive combination model. Although the original Bliss independence model (corresponding to the multiplicative level of Bliss boosting) is based on statistical independence, that foundation has no clear relevance to biological systems, where widely separated targets are neither statistically independent nor cleanly competing for the same end point. The Bliss boosting and potentiation models were included in our analysis to describe distinct shapes observed in our screens, and for well-sampled dose matrices neither is very good at fitting the effects that the other was designed to describe.Pathway simulations Simulations of metabolic pathways were performed using the XPPAUT ordinary differential equation simulation software (Ermentrout, 2002), on Boston University's Biowulf computing cluster. The network shown in Figure 3 was modelled as a system of Michaelis–Menten enzymatic reactions, each with three kinetic parameters: the limiting reaction rate Vm, the rate constant Km, and an exponential degradation rate Dg. The two pathways were driven by supplying substrates S1 and S11 from limitless sources with constant reaction velocities, and converting them through the enzymatic reactions before passing through the end-point reaction RE into a limitless sink. For symmetry and simplicity, we set all Vm=1 and Km=1, and the degradations Dg to a lower level of 0.01 in most cases. We used Dg=1 for substrates at bifurcations and for the final product of Pathway A to ensure illustrative differences in the single agent inhibitions (reducing response shape degeneracies) and to balance the flux through both pathways (for stable simulations). The system was initially started with all substrate levels set to 0.1 and run to steady state using an RK4 integration algorithm calculated at time intervals of 0.001 over 1 000 000 iterations, and the resulting substrate levels and parameter settings are shown in Supplementary 1. The combination response for each pair of inhibitors was determined using 100 simulations over a 10 × 10 dose matrix, where for each dosing point the targeted reactions were restricted by competitive inhibitors (that affect Km) and the simulation was run for a further 600 000 iterations using a step size of 0.005, before the inhibition I=1–T/U was calculated on the treated end-point reaction velocity T, relative to the untreated velocity U. Optimal 9-point inhibitor concentration samples were chosen for each single agent by using a bisection search to find the single agent's EC10 and EC90 concentrations, defining six samples with a fixed dilution factor f=(EC90/EC10)0.2 to cover that range, and extending the total range with two additional concentration steps above the EC90 and one more below the EC10 at the same dilution factor f. The resulting combination response data are tabulated in Supplementary 2. Each surface was compared to the models presented in Figure 2 (assuming 1% inhibition errors), and the best fit was determined to be HSA, Loewe additivity, Bliss boosting, or potentiation, in that order, depending on which was first consistent with the best-fitting model's χ2 (where consistency meant that its χ2 was less than twice the best fit's). Bliss boosting models were further classified as cancelling, suppressing, masking, multiplicative, or saturating, where it could be uniquely specified given the single agent limiting efficacies. The shape classifications, chi-squared, and best-fit parameter values are listed in Supplementary 2, and the shapes are also summarized in Figure 3. Supplementary Figure S1 compares the shape classifications and target connectivities from this simulation to epistasis calculations (Segrè et al, 2005; Yeh et al, 2006) based on single concentration points taken from the matrices. We varied the model parameters to explore the sensitivity of our results to the kinetic parameters. First, we performed Monte Carlo tests with 100 simulations, each time allowing all of the parameters to randomly vary with uniform probability density within a multiplicative range 10±Δ, and counted how often the best-fit model surface agreed with the original fit before perturbation (Supplementary Figure S2). The Monte Carlo tests were repeated with steadily increasing Δ, to determine the level at which the unperturbed simulations failed to predict the outcome, both with all Vm, Km, and Dg varied simultaneously, and with each parameter class perturbed separately. Finally, we explored sensitivity to individual nodes by perturbing each enzyme in Pathway A separately. We also explored some simulation assumptions to test the robustness of our results. First, we replaced the competitive inhibitor kinetics with non-competitive (affecting Vm) inhibition, performed the simulations, and repeated the model fitting to determine the best-fit response shapes. Second, we addressed the concern that a metabolic reaction velocity might provide a poor comparison to proliferation, the most accessible experimental end point. As proliferating cells undergo exponential doubling, a linear reduction of velocity by a factor T/U for a growth-limiting metabolic reaction should slow the doubling time by a proportional factor. Over a time interval corresponding to n uninhibited doublings, the resulting inhibition of cell population becomes Igrowth∼1–2nIv, in terms of the velocity-based inhibition IV. We applied this transformation to our simulated dose-matrix inhibitions for Pathway A, assuming n∼10 doublings, and repeated the surface fitting procedure on the transformed dose matrices to determine the best-fit response shapes.Combination screening experiments The chemical library was archived in robotically accessible vials, to which diluent (dimethyl sulphoxide or water) was added in preparation for addition to 384-well master plates by a Tecan Freedom liquid-dispensing robot. Liquid transfers to dilution and assay plates were handled using a Perkin-Elmer MiniTrak station adapted for the combination high-throughput procedure. Each 384-well assay plate contained six 6 × 6 dose-matrix blocks, with four serial dilutions (two-fold for yeast and four-fold for HCT116) of the top concentration for each agent. Additional wells were reserved for transfer and untreated control wells. The compound mixtures were then added to the biological component of the assay as appropriate. For the yeast experiment, C. glabrata (ATC #90030) cultures were cultured overnight in flasks with RPMI media in a 32°C shaker at 250 r.p.m. The next day, the cultures were diluted into media until they had an absorbance equivalent to 50% of McFarland standard, corresponding to a density of ∼8000 cells/ml, and dispensed with automated dispensers into 384-well assay plates (35 μl wells containing media and test compounds) to yield ∼160 cells/well. The plates were incubated in the presence of drugs and media at 32°C for 18 h (∼10 doublings). Upon completion, cell populations were measured at a single time point, with a metabolic Alamar Blue fluorescence reagent (at 590 nm emission) using a Perkin-Elmer Fusion plate reader after excitation at 535 nm. For the tumour cell line experiment, the HCT116 (ATC #CCL-247) cells were cultured in flasks with RPMI-1640 media for 2–20 passages, drawing test populations along the way. Extracts were trypsinized, counted, and seeded into 384-well plates at a density of 1500 cells/well in 35 μl media using automated dispensers. To ensure adherence, the plated cells were incubated at 37°C, with 5% CO2 overnight, after which the compounds were added and the plates were incubated again at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 72 h (or about 2–3 doublings). After incubation, 10.5% Alamar Blue fluorescence dye (in 40 μl media) was added and plates were incubated for 6 h. Cell population measurements were made at a single time point upon completion, using a Perkin-Elmer Victor II plate reader (excitation at 535/590 nm emission). This experimental procedure has a variety of sources for error in final proliferation measurements. Each compound is dissolved once in a single stock tube, and delivered into X- and Y-diluted master plates. Aliquots are then transferred from the master plates to each assay plate to produce the combinations. While this approach permits orthogonal serial dilutions and aids uniformity across instances of each master plate, there can be systematic errors in compound plating between the X and Y masters for less stable compounds. Cells are seeded in media at high densities, to reduce the well-to-well variability, but occasional clogs in a pipette can lead to non-uniform distribution. During incubation, slight variations in temperature or humidity can lead to varying growth rates across wells on a plate and between plates. Because the single cell population measurement is made during the exponential growth phase, variations can be amplified in the final readout, and this variation can be exaggerated when cells are sensitized by test compounds. The result of these various factors is that cell population measurements vary by ∼1–3% on each plate, across untreated wells, and the variations do not fit a normal distribution. Moreover, some 1–2% of wells on each plate show occasional spikes that are very different from their neighbours. The contents of each plate were tracked in an automated laboratory information management system, using integrated barcode scanners in the liquid handling equipment, and stored in an Oracle database. Plates lacking compound transfers or with insufficient dynamic range (signal-to-noise ratio <5 between untreated controls and a cell-free background) were rejected and repeated. The remaining plates were inspected using custom quality control software. Individual wells that fell outside the expected range for normal assay readouts, or which were discontinuous with their neighbours, were marked for exclusion. Finally, the single agent wells in each combination block were visually inspected for consistency across the experiment, and combination blocks containing the most discrepant single agents were marked for exclusion.Data analysis Dose matrices were assembled from replicate combination blocks on experimental plates. Some of the data showed systematic variations across the plate, most likely owing to temperature or humidity gradients during incubation. In order to correct these effects, our assay plates had 40 untreated wells arranged around and between the blocks. The systematic variations were removed by fitting a smooth function of plate location to the untreated well data values, and dividing out the modelled spatial variation. After plate effect correction, fluorescence counts T from each treated well were converted to inhibitions Idata=(U−T)/U relative to the median U of 20 untreated wells. Replicate blocks for each dose matrix were merged, using the median inhibition at each dosing point. Standard error estimates σdata for each median inhibition were also calculated, based on the quadrature sum of a minimum acceptable 3% error, the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the corrected untreated data on each plate normalized to their median, and the MAD between replicate inhibition data between plates, using an empirical conversion from MAD to standard deviations (Filliben, 2005). Each dose matrix was scored for synergy, and combination effects were compared to our response morphology models (Figure 2). Sigmoidal dose responses I=ECa/(Sa+Ca) as a function of concentration C were fitted to the single agent data, where E is the limiting efficacy at high concentration, S is the effective concentration, and a is the sigmoidicity or steepness of transition. These fitted curves were used for combination effect models. The HSA, Bliss boosting, and potentiation models were calculated, and the Loewe additivity model was solved at each dosing point by iterative root finding (Berenbaum, 1985). As a quantitative estimate of the combination activity, we computed HSA volume excess scores VHSA=∑X,Y ln fX ln fY(Idata–IHSA), summed over all CX,CY, along with an associated error estimate σHSA=sqrt[∑X,Y ln2 fX ln2 fYσ2data], both expressions using adjustments to account for differing dilution factors fX, fY. This volume measures the total excess inhibition, summed over dimensionless log-concentration space. Data surfaces were compared to the shapes presented in Figure 2 by varying the model parameters, using a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm (Press et al, 1997, §10.4) to minimize χ2=Σdata[(Idata–Imodel)/σdata]2/Ndata, the reduced chi-squared. All four models were explored, and the overall best fit with the least chi-square χ2min was chosen to represent the shape of the combination. A best fit was chosen from HSA, additivity, boosting, or potentiation, in that order, depending on which was first consistent with the χ2min (Δχ2<χ2min). Finally, systematic errors that were not captured by our error estimates from replicates can be estimated by examining the drug-with-self combinations as a negative control for combination effect. For both screens, the median Loewe additivity χ2 was ∼9, suggesting that the true reproducibility of drug response was roughly three times the estimated levels from the scatter between replicates. This suggests systematic errors of ∼10% at each dose-matrix point, leading to integrated volume error estimates of σHSA∼0.4. Thus, only combination effects with VHSA>1 are strong enough to be reliably distinguishable from drug-with-itself combinations. For the HCT116 combination screen, synergy profiles were constructed for each drug by collecting into a vector all the VHSA scores involving that chemical. These profiles were then compared for all pairs of drugs in the screen by means of the Pearson correlation coefficient. The synergy profile correlations and synergy scores were grouped by the target similarity (Supplementary 5) of the two drugs in each combination, and classified as follows: ‘Identical' for drug-with-itself; ‘Same' for distinct drugs inhibiting the same target; ‘Related' for differing targets sharing a common functional group; ‘Kinases' for combinations of kinase inhibitors; ‘Different' for unrelated pairs of drugs; and ‘Unknown' for pairs involving one or more unknown mechanism. The target similarity group distributions were compared for significant differences using a chi-square test that assumes only Poisson counting statistics within each bin in the histograms (Press et al, 1997, §14.3.3).Supplementary Material Supplementary figures XPPAUT ODE file specifying the reaction network shown in Fig. 3 Drugs used in the HCT116 tumour cell proliferation screen Sup_5 Response surfaces and shape model fits for the pathway simulations Monte Carlo simulation results for the multiply-inhibited branched pathway Combination response data and shape fitting results for the C. glabrata proliferation experiment Combination scores from the HCT116 tumour cell proliferation screen Statistical results for the HCT116 tumour cell proliferation screen S. cerrevisiae drug sensitivity and genetic interaction data relevant to the C. glabrata experiment

Sagoo and colleagues describe key components of the methodology for undertaking systematic reviews and meta-analyses of genetic association studies.	Gurdeep S. Sagoo and colleagues describe key components of the methodology for undertaking systematic reviews and meta-analyses of genetic association studies. The past decade has witnessed growing interest in genetic predisposition to common diseases, and along with rapid advancements in high-throughput genotyping technology, has resulted in a tremendous amount of published epidemiological evidence on gene-disease associations. Reported genetic associations with common diseases have become numerous and are mostly of small magnitude [1]. With this growth in evidence has come an increasing need to collate and summarize the evidence in order to identify true genetic associations among the large volume of false positives [2]. Convincing evidence of true association therefore requires careful control over potential biases and chance effects. Control over bias is important both in study design [3] and in considering the selective availability of data on associations that have been examined [4]. Because most genetic associations are small, large sample sizes are necessary for their detection, especially when many genetic variants are investigated simultaneously, as in genome-wide association studies. Furthermore, replication of findings in independent data sets is now widely regarded as a prerequisite for convincing evidence of association. Thus, multiple studies from several independent groups exist. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have become a common approach to summarize gene-disease associations [5]. However, as apparently inconsistent results and interpretations of syntheses of evidence on the same genetic association have been reported [6], it is useful to lay out issues in the methods and conduct of these types of research studies. The Human Genome Epidemiology Network (HuGENet) has developed “HuGE reviews” (typically systematic reviews) as the cornerstone of an online resource containing the cumulative and changing information on epidemiologic aspects of human genes [7]. Many of these contain meta-analyses, or statistical syntheses of the findings from multiple studies. In this article, we describe some key components of the methodology for undertaking systematic reviews and meta-analyses of genetic association studies. Detailed discussions of these issues and further recommendations can be found in the HuGE Review Handbook [8] (see also Box 1). Additional detailed guidance on conducting systematic reviews is available in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [9] and The Handbook of Research Synthesis [10].Why Systematic Reviews? Traditional (narrative) reviews are subjective, and as such have a number of disadvantages that lead them to being more prone to bias and error [11]. Narrative reviews rarely state how studies were selected for inclusion, how (or whether) their quality was assessed, or how the findings from multiple studies were synthesized in order to draw conclusions. This can lead to a review that supports and reinforces the author's view, which can be misleading. In contrast, systematic reviews are designed as rigorous research studies. They allow a more objective appraisal of the evidence than a narrative review by aiming to identify, critique, and synthesize evidence from all relevant existing studies on the topic in question using predefined methods. Figure 1 outlines the general processes involved in a systematic review.Summary Points Systematic reviews of genetic association studies are preferable to narrative reviews, since they make the processes more transparent. Objectives, criteria for including studies, and methods for the systematic review should be stated in advance, ideally by writing a protocol. Comprehensive searches for studies should include more than one bibliographic database, as well as sources of grey literature such as online data repositories. Data should be extracted from reports independently by at least two people; primary study authors should be contacted for missing data or for issues that are unclear from reports. It is important to assess the validity of each included study, although convincing evidence of what study characteristics are most important is lacking. Meta-analysis of effect sizes (e.g., odds ratios) should be performed where possible and appropriate, acknowledging any heterogeneity and the potential for bias within included studies (e.g., poor validity, selective reporting) and in the data set as a whole (e.g., publication bias). Studies (rather than reports) should be the unit of analysis, to ensure data are not double-counted.Box 1: Development of This Guidance The guidance in this paper stems primarily from the Human Genome Epidemiology Network (HuGENet) HuGE Review Handbook. This document arose from a two-day discussion workshop held in Cambridge, United Kingdom, on November 2–3, 2004. In attendance were 27 participants with expertise in genetic epidemiology, clinical medicine, public health, meta-analysis, systematic review methods, searching, and statistical methods. The discussions built on previous iterations of guidance from the HuGENet Executive Committee. Speakers at the workshop were asked to comment on current methods, on empirical evidence currently available to guide methods, and on current uncertainties. A writing committee was appointed to produce the Handbook, under the editorship of Julian Little and Julian Higgins. The Handbook was influenced heavily by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, which has a long history of evolution and is also based on empirical evidence where available. The guidance has been updated for this paper to reflect developments in technology and methodology. Gurdeep Sagoo was invited to join to bring a new perspective, given his experience of undertaking HuGE systematic reviews. Passages about genome-wide association studies were added at the request of the current journal editors and are based on the consensus of the authors. The development of the guidance benefits from being the broad consensus (in 2004 to 2006) of numerous individuals with an interest in systematic reviews, but does not claim to be authoritative or to reflect the current views of all people listed below.

Data for systematic reviews are typically collated primarily from publications, often supplemented by data from correspondence with authors of the original studies. In the field of human genome epidemiology, however, the ability to look at increasing numbers of markers prevents the publication of summary data for each genetic variant in a traditional journal format. A variety of sources may therefore be used, including the published literature, online supplementary materials, online databases, and study authors. An increasingly popular technique is the meta-analysis of individual participant data through the collaboration of a consortium of investigators. This is likely to minimize bias compared with a literature-based systematic review, but possibly at the expense of precision, since a comprehensive systematic review may include evidence from studies that are not involved in the consortium. The two approaches are complementary to one another, and some of their potential advantages and disadvantages are summarized in Table 1.Figure 1Process of a Systematic ReviewTable 1Data Sources for Meta-Analysis of Genetic Association StudiesPreparation of a Protocol Like other research studies, systematic reviews should ideally be carefully planned with a detailed protocol prepared in advance. Producing a protocol with criteria predefined for study selection will minimize any selection bias based on study results. Such a protocol should therefore clearly formulate the review question, explain the rationale for conducting such a review, define a priori eligibility criteria for study inclusion, describe the methods for conducting a comprehensive search for studies, indicate the methods for assessing study validity and relevance, and state whether a meta-analysis is planned and describe the methodology to be used for conducting such an analysis.Objectives and Eligibility Criteria The objectives of a systematic review of genetic association studies will typically be (i) to identify all epidemiological investigations of the associations of interest; (ii) to assess the validity of the evidence; (iii) to determine whether an association exists; (iv) to assess whether associations are consistent across studies in magnitude and direction; and (v) to quantify the likely magnitude of an association if it exists. Associations of interest have in the past usually been identified through biological plausibility, although candidate associations are now frequently identified from genome-wide association studies. The applicability of a systematic review depends on the selection of appropriate studies to be included in it. Eligibility criteria for the review, defined a priori, should allow relevant studies investigating the gene(s), allelic variant(s), disease(s), clinical subtypes, and any other outcomes of interest (such as molecular biomarkers) to be easily identifiable and included in the review. Appropriate study designs and study populations should also be considered in order to allow the reliable assessment of associations and interactions.Searching for Eligible Studies A key characteristic of a systematic review is a comprehensive search. Limiting a review to studies identified only from MEDLINE (or PubMed) is usually insufficient, for two reasons. First, any review restricted to published literature is prone to publication bias, whereby only a subset comprising the most “publishable” findings are available from the totality of evidence on a particular genetic association. Thus, sources beyond the published literature should be examined. Second, even within the published literature, reporting bias may be present whereby studies with different conclusions are published in different types of journals. MEDLINE is just one of several major sources of bibliographic information. These biases may, to some extent, be reduced by searching comprehensively for studies available through other sources. Other bibliographic databases likely to be useful for genetic association studies include EMBASE and the Science Citation Index. Overlap between these various databases is far from complete; for example, of approximately 4,800 journals indexed in EMBASE, 1,700 are not indexed in MEDLINE (see Chapter 6 in [9]). The implications of this incomplete overlap for genetic association studies are not clear. Furthermore, bibliographic searches may still not retrieve all articles that are in the indexed journals [12]. Further sources that might be searched include reference lists of study reports and review articles, Web sites, theses, books, reports, and online databases (including data repositories for genome-wide and other association studies [13]). Sources other than peer-reviewed journals are often referred to as “grey literature.” Once the searches have been undertaken, the records identified need to be assessed against the eligibility criteria for the review. A typical example of the process from search to selection is illustrated in Figure 2.Figure 2A Typical Process for Searching and Assessing Eligibility of StudiesMinimizing Human Error All reasonable attempts should be made to prevent the introduction of errors and personal biases. An important attribute of systematic reviews is that criteria for study inclusion are clearly prespecified. This is perhaps the most notable difference between a narrative review and a systematic review. Independent duplication of steps in the review process, such as selection of studies, extraction of data, and critical assessment of methods used in the individual studies, can further reduce biases and minimize errors. Accidental omission of data, or accidental duplication of a study in a meta-analysis, may lead to spurious false-negative or false-positive findings.Assessing Validity of Each Study The validity of a meta-analysis depends on the validity of the studies included within it, so it is important that each component study is appraised before being included. Because effect magnitudes in genetic association studies are generally small (i.e., odds ratio < 1.2), even small biases may be important. The most important sources of bias in genetic association studies are less well understood than those in other study designs such as randomized trials. Extensive discussions of potential biases are available, with the principal candidates being case definition, population stratification (confounding due to sub-populations in the sample that differ both in genotype prevalence and disease risk), and methods in the collection, handling, and processing of DNA and the determination of genotypes (including blinding to case-control status) [3,14]. Little empirical evidence associating study results with study characteristics for genetic association studies exists as yet, however. This evidence will perhaps be most reliably derived from meta-epidemiological studies, in which results of studies with different characteristics are compared within meta-analyses, and findings are synthesized across meta-analyses to enhance power [15,16]. The appraisal of potential biases is difficult in practice, not only because of the uncertainty over which study characteristics are important, but also because of incomplete or variable reporting of the methods used in the studies themselves [17]. Initiatives such as the STREGA (STrengthening the REporting of Genetic Association Studies) statement, which offers guidelines for reporting of individual genetic association studies, may improve the situation in the future.Assessing Bias in the Review as a Whole In addition to potential biases in the individual studies, attention should be paid to bias in the collection of studies as a whole. Two particular considerations are reporting biases and bias in the selection of genetic variants to study. Reporting biases include both publication bias, which typically refers to suppression of evidence concerning an entire study on the basis of its findings, and selective reporting, whereby only the most exciting findings are reported. Selective reporting of only the most promising variants is a natural consequence of an attempt to summarize an association study of many genetic markers within the constraints of a traditional paper journal article. To overcome these constraints, association studies are increasingly exploiting Web-based publication for complete findings, although in practice there are often obstacles to prevent this occurring. The possibility of reporting biases can only be discarded if it is known that all eligible data from all eligible studies are available (or if a truly unbiased subset of these data is available). It is difficult to imagine situations in which reviewers are confident that all existing studies are either known or reported without bias. The most reliable way to overcome these biases is therefore in the prospective generation of data, for example by using a consortium-based approach. It is also helpful to keep in mind that the very act of investigating a gene-disease association may be dependent on earlier results. Even in a world of flawless studies that are completely reported, it is likely that the most exciting findings are those that are targets for replication. Initial exciting findings may well be chance effects, and so situations in which a meta-analysis is contemplated (those in which multiple studies exist) comprise a biased subset of possibly important associations. There is good evidence of the exaggerated effect that is often seen in the earliest report of an association compared with subsequent attempts to replicate the finding [18].Meta-Analysis Meta-analysis is the statistical synthesis of results from multiple studies [19]: an example is provided in Figure 3 [20]. When implemented and interpreted appropriately, and applied to unbiased and correctly analyzed studies, it provides a powerful tool to understand both similarities and differences in results from multiple studies. By exploiting the totality of evidence, meta-analyses offer enhanced power to detect associations and increased precision in the estimation of their magnitude. Meta-analyses are encouraged in systematic reviews. However, attention should always be paid to the possibility of reporting biases in reviews based on published literature. Furthermore, it is important that each entry in a meta-analysis represents an independent sample of data. Thus for example, multiple reports of the same study need to be merged to obtain a single “best” answer for that study prior to inclusion in the meta-analysis.Figure 3Example of a Forest Plot The plot shows the relation between N-acetyltransferase (NAT1) acetylation status (slow or rapid) and bladder cancer risk (data from Sanderson et al. [20]). The classification of acetylation phenotype is made either directly, by measuring the metabolism of a probe drug, or indirectly, by measuring the genotype associated with that phenotype. Most meta-analyses are undertaken by calculating weighted averages of the estimates from multiple studies. A metric is chosen for the analysis that ensures comparable quantities with reasonable statistical properties. For example, log odds ratios are typically combined for case-control studies (and then presented as odds ratios). If quantitative traits are measured using different methods across studies, they may be standardized before pooling, usually by expressing the results in terms of standard deviations. Consistency of results across studies should always be evaluated, and can be achieved using a statistical test of homogeneity or by quantifying the between-study variance (or quantities derived from these such as I2, which describes the proportion variation in point estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than within-study error [21]). Potential reasons for variation in findings across studies should also be investigated. To minimize unreliable consequences from multiple testing, potential sources of variation in study results should be limited in number and prespecified whenever possible. Consideration should be given to using methods to temper the statistical significance of findings based on a small number of studies [22]. Sensitivity analyses are to be encouraged, to ensure that findings are robust. For example, undue influence of the initial study, of smaller studies, or of studies with potential biases may be responsible for inappropriate conclusions. Furthermore, the choice of statistical model (or method) or the inclusion of studies with uncertain eligibility for the systematic review may affect the results, and robustness to these should also be evaluated. Meta-analysis methods of gene-disease association studies closely follow well-developed methodology for randomized trials [4,6,23]. Due to so-called “Mendelian randomization” in the transmission of genetic material from parents to children, confounding is generally thought to be of minimal concern (although not ignorable, since it may arise through population stratification). Thus, unadjusted analyses are common in meta-analyses, even if matched studies have adjusted for matching factors such as age and sex. The era of genome-wide association studies has implications for the meta-analysis of genetic associations. Although, in principle, summary data for the variant(s) of interest in the review should be sought from available genome-wide association studies in the same way as they are sought from candidate gene studies, in practice many genome-wide association studies are designed primarily for detecting associations rather than quantifying them, and the potential for bias must be assessed. Furthermore, the variant(s) of interest might not have been included in a genome-wide scan. While it is possible that some unknown genotypes could be imputed, proposed methods typically require detailed data [24], and it is unclear whether a more naive approach, based on minimal summary data and linkage disequilibrium information, would be appropriate. Other special considerations in the meta-analysis of gene-disease associations are discussed in detail elsewhere and include the choice of inheritance model [25,26], the treatment of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [27,28], and the combination of associations for markers known to be in linkage disequilibrium [29]. Developments in the last area are now allowing complex syntheses of data across whole-genome-wide association studies [30].Presenting and Interpreting Results A systematic summary of all available evidence should allow the strengths and gaps in the evidence base to be identified and allow recommendations to be made in order to stimulate research to address such gaps. The magnitude of the association between the allelic variants and the clinical outcomes studied in terms of relative and attributable risks in different populations should be summarized in a systematic and concise way. Comments should also be provided on the quality and methodology of studies. Tables should summarize information on each gene-disease association study (possibly online as Web-based supplements, depending on size and journal formats). Table 2 lists some of the characteristics most likely to be relevant. If a meta-analysis is conducted, these should usually be presented as forest plots as in Figure 3. Statistics related to heterogeneity (e.g., between-study variance or I2 and confidence intervals) and investigations of bias should be presented. Multiple subgroup and sensitivity analyses are conveniently presented as “overview” forest plots without including the individual studies.Table 2Characteristics Likely To Be of Interest for Each Study Included in a Review A discussion of the results should also address issues such as the overall quantity and quality of the evidence base, the consideration of possible publication and selective reporting biases, the likelihood that associations are causal, and any potential public health applications. For example, results from small or few studies should be interpreted with great caution, as it is common to see dissipation of early claimed effects [31], and early studies have no predictive power for the subsequent picture of the evidence [32]. Interim guidance is available to assess the strength of evidence that an observed association is genuine [33]. These criteria assess the three domains of precision (i.e., through sample size), consistency of results across studies (i.e., through meta-analytic measures of heterogeneity), and protection from bias both within and across studies in a meta-analysis. Additional detailed guidance for the general reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses are available from PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews; formerly known as QUOROM) [34]. Reporting guidance for meta-analyses of observational studies are also available from MOOSE (Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) [35].Concluding Remarks The strengths and limitations of systematic reviews are well established for clinical trials, largely through the efforts of The Cochrane Collaboration [36]. They are increasingly being applied to observational studies, and currently there are as many meta-analyses of observational data conducted as there are of clinical trials. The citation impact of both types of meta-analyses is equally high, the highest among all study designs in the health sciences [37]. The principal value of a well-conducted systematic review of genetic association studies is in establishing reliably the presence and magnitude of individual gene-disease associations. By complementing both consortium-based pooled analyses and larger-scale attempts to collate genetic association evidence across whole fields, they play an important role alongside other research designs in the integration of evidence on genetic association [5]. At their most ambitious, systematic reviews and meta-analyses can collate evidence across all studied genetic variants for a phenotype, with notable examples provided by three databases of genetic association evidence for Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and schizophrenia that include ad hoc meta-analyses [38–40]. Within the Summary Points we summarize our key suggestions for methodology of systematic reviews of genetic association studies. These reflect our accumulated experience to date and are not intended to lay down standards for universal application. This is an area of rapid development. In a decade's time, appropriate methods for the collation and integration of evidence on gene-disease association may be substantially different.

A convenient and genetically well characterized small-animal model that exhibits reproducible, quantifiable oxygen reperfusion damage is currently lacking. Here we describe the dynamics of whole-organism metabolic recovery from anoxia in an insect, , and report that damage caused by oxygen reperfusion can be quantified in a novel but straightforward way. We monitored CO2 emission (an index of mitochondrial activity) and water vapor output (an index of neuromuscular control of the spiracles, which are valves between the outside air and the insect's tracheal system) during entry into, and recovery from, rapid-onset anoxia exposure with durations ranging from 7.5 to 120 minutes. Anoxia caused a brief peak of CO2 output followed by knock-out. Mitochondrial respiration ceased and the spiracle constrictor muscles relaxed, but then re-contracted, presumably powered by anaerobic processes. Reperfusion to sustained normoxia caused a bimodal re-activation of mitochondrial respiration, and in the case of the spiracle constrictor muscles, slow inactivation followed by re-activation. After long anoxia durations, both the bimodality of mitochondrial reactivation and the recovery of spiracular control were impaired. Repeated reperfusion followed by episodes of anoxia depressed mitochondrial respiratory flux rates and damaged the integrity of the spiracular control system in a dose-dependent fashion. This is the first time that physiological evidence of oxygen reperfusion damage has been described in an insect or any invertebrate. We suggest that some of the traditional approaches of insect respiratory biology, such as quantifying respiratory water loss, may facilitate using as a convenient, well-characterized experimental model for studying the underlying biology and mechanisms of ischemia and reperfusion damage and its possible mitigation.

Introduction Oxygen is essential for most multicellular life-forms. However, it can also be toxic due to its biotransformation into reactive oxygen species (ROS). For example, many turtles are able to hibernate underwater for months but with a potential danger of ROS overgeneration during resumption of breathing. This is analogous to the situation of oxidative stress in mammalian organs subject to ischemia and reperfusion. In other words, the well-known deadly effects of anoxia (e.g., caused by ischemia) in higher animals such as mammals are caused in most cases not by anoxia per se but by subsequent reperfusion with O2 [1]–[3]. As Joanisse and Storey state, “Damage resulting from oxidative stress, defined as any condition where the rate of ROS production surpasses the ability of antioxidant systems to buffer them, has been demonstrated under numerous conditions (notably ischaemia-reperfusion, iron-overload and increased oxidative metabolism such as during exhaustive exercise). All cellular components are susceptible to attack by ROS. Damage to proteins, DNA and lipids (more particularly to polyunsaturated fatty acids) may result in loss of function, conformational changes and the formation of cytotoxic low molecular mass breakdown products” [4]. The use of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for studying responses to hypoxia and anoxia has, however, concentrated on gene expression, rather than on whole-organism physiological responses (e.g., [5]–[8]). The short-term responses of the intact, functioning fly to anoxic stressors and the effects of reperfusion, in terms of non-invasively quantifiable parameters such as mitochondrial respiration and the integrity of respiratory control systems, have to our knowledge received no attention, although the long-term effects of hypoxia and hyperoxia are attracting interest [9]. Indeed, to our knowledge, strong physiological evidence for reperfusion damage has yet to be reported in any invertebrate. This is surprising because insects in particular are ideal models for studying the whole-organism physiological effects of hypoxia, anoxia and reperfusion. This is because their cells do not depend on a functioning heart and bloodstream for respiratory gas exchange. Instead, they are directly exposed to air via the tracheal system. Briefly, insects possess highly branched, gas-filled tubes called tracheae ([10] and references therein), which connect the tissues to the outside air through small closeable valves called spiracles. O2 and CO2 are delivered about 200,000- and 10,000-fold, respectively, more rapidly in tracheal air than in aqueous environments such as blood [10], [11]. This makes it possible to monitor the effect of stressors at the cellular and sub-cellular level, for example the mitochondria, in near-real time without requiring a functioning circulatory system. The spiracles are sensitive to internal O2 levels via the CNS, and react to changes by dilating or constricting their open area to maintain an adequate tracheal O2 concentration [12]. Thus hypoxia and anoxia are useful tools for eliciting information on respiratory control mechanisms at the whole-organism level of integration (e.g. [13]–[17]). Spiracles are actively closed by constrictor muscles. The integrity of these muscles, and that of their CNS-mediated control mechanisms, are vitally important because the tracheae are largely or entirely saturated with water vapor. Thus, faulty spiracular control leads rapidly to death by dehydration [18]–[20]. Spiracular area and thus the state of the spiracle control mechanism is easily assayed in a flow-through respirometry system [21] by measuring water vapor flux rate, which acts as an index of spiracular area [15], [17], [22], [23]. Here, we describe for the first time in any invertebrate animal the effects of anoxia-administered with both single and repeated reperfusions of O2-on metabolic kinetics (assayed by mitochondrial CO2 output), and on organismal integrity (assayed in this case by water loss rate, which is an index of spiracular control, and thus of the functional integrity of the neuromuscular and respiratory systems).Results and DiscussionSingle reperfusion The mean mass of our flies was 0.804±0.010 mg (N = 48, i.e. 8 male flies at each of 6 anoxia durations; 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes at 25°C). Prior to exposure to anoxia, mean water loss rate (WLR) was 0.0617±0.0034 mg hr−1 and mean rate of CO2 production (VCO2) was 3.23±0.12 µl hr−1 (N = 48 for each; this N holds for all subsequent statistics unless otherwise noted). The flies were continuously active. CO2 output was continuous, through slightly open spiracles. D. melanogaster can constrict, but cannot completely close, their spiracles [24]. A typical recording is shown in Fig. 1. Immediately after exposure to anoxia, the flies responded with a “spike” of CO2 output that reached a peak CO2 output rate, measured over the highest 10 seconds of the peak, of 6.77±0.21 µl hr−1. This is a highly significant increase over previous levels (t = 14.79, df = 94, P<10−5). Following this “spike”, CO2 output levels declined with first-order kinetics, reaching levels similar to baseline (zero) within 15 minutes.10.1371/journal.pone.0001267.g001Figure 1Entry into, and recovery from, a single bout of anoxia. Typical effects of 60 minutes of anoxia on the CO2 emission rate (VCO2; black), water loss rate (WLR; red) and activity (green; no units shown) of a male Drosophila melanogaster, mass 0.916 mg, at 25°C. B = baselines. A = initiation of anoxia. N = return to normoxia, S = secondary CO2 peak after reperfusion to normoxia. Note the increase in VCO2 after recovery from anoxia (recovery is evident in the activity trace). It is to be expected that the fly's spiracles would open rapidly in anoxia, to maximize their open area [14], [15]. However, the CO2 “spike” preceded any increase in spiracular area, as measured by water vapor output. Therefore we presume that the “spike” may have originated from a rapid accumulation of intermediate acids such as lactate or acetate that drove buffered CO2 from the fly's hemolymph and tissues. Alternatively or in addition, it may have corresponded to increased activity levels (escape behavior) that took place when the fly first detected the drop in oxygen concentration. The lag-corrected water vapor signal peaked 101.2±7.4 seconds after the peak CO2 output, by which point all fly activity had ceased. This disparity was not caused by the relative positions of the analyzers in the gas path. The water vapor analyzer was placed before the CO2 analyzer, and the signals from both analyzers were lag-corrected in the analysis program to compensate precisely for the delays caused by their relative positions in the flow path. The response time of the water vapor analyzer was likewise not the cause of this effect, because excretory water loss signals showed a rise time approximately 5-fold faster than the signals originating from the opening of the spiracles. Because we know that the spiracles of D. melanogaster can react rapidly to changes in gas levels [15], we infer that this very slow spiracular response was caused by lack of O2. The highest sustained 10 seconds of WLR was 0.142±0.011 mg h−1, over double the pre-exposure levels (t = 7.07, P<10−5). It should be emphasized that the pre-exposure levels included both respiratory and cuticular WLR, whereas the anoxic increment was purely respiratory in origin, making this increase even more dramatic. With regard to WLR, it should also be noted that a decline over time in a dry atmosphere is normal in insects [25]. Thus, the pre-exposure estimate of WLR is likely an overestimate with reference to steady-state rates. What happened next was unexpected. Instead of remaining open, the spiracles constricted again. Note that “constricted” does not equate to “closed”; as far as is known, D. melanogaster is unable to fully close its spiracles [24]. Overall WLR, measured over the most level 60 seconds occurring within the period of anoxia exposure, returned to low levels (0.0386±0.0035 mg hr−1). This WLR was significantly lower than the pre-anoxia rate (t = 4.67, P = 10−5), and indicates that the spiracle constrictor muscles were contracted to their maximum extent (though, as noted above, the spiracles could not be completely closed) in order to minimize WLRs. Respiratory gas exchange had, of course, ceased because of lack of oxygen. Because respiratory WLR in D. melanogaster is ca. 25% of total WLR [15], a 25% reduction from pre-exposure levels of 0.0617 mg hr−1 would be predicted (to 0.0463 mg hr−1). This does not differ significantly from observed levels (t = 1.52, P>0.1). On reperfusion with O2, the first reaction was a large peak in CO2 output as the mitochondria were re-activated. The magnitude of this peak declined significantly with increasing duration of anoxia exposure (F1, 46 = 10.52, P = 0.002). This CO2 peak exited through spiracles that, although constricted, still allowed some gas exchange [24]; as noted above, the spiracles of D. melanogaster do not close completely, and so allowed the ingress of O2 and the egress of CO2. Following this “recovery spike”, a second, much smaller, peak of CO2 output was visible (see Fig. 1), the volume of which was far larger for intermediate durations of hypoxic exposure (15–30 minutes) than for longer or shorter durations (Fig. 2A). After 15 minutes of anoxia, the volume of the peak was inversely related to the duration of anoxic exposure (Fig. 2A). It is possible that this secondary peak is related to repair processes subsequent to reperfusion. In this respect it is suggestive that as the volume of this secondary peak declined with longer exposure to anoxia, recovery rates fell (see below).10.1371/journal.pone.0001267.g002Figure 2Effects of anoxia duration. The relation between anoxia duration and A) the volume of the secondary peak of CO2 emission after reperfusion to normoxia (measured by integration of the secondary peak against the background level of the primary peak, using sloping baselines). The secondary peak attains a maximum value after 30 minutes of anoxia exposure. Anoxia duration significantly affected the secondary peak areas (F4, 32 = 12.73, P<10−6); B) the minimum level of water loss rate (WLR) attained after reperfusion to normoxia, which is inversely related to the integrity of spiracular function. The longer the exposure to anoxia, the less adequately the spiracular control system recovered (F5, 42 = 9.94, P<10−5); C) the time required to resume voluntary activity (recovery). The longer the exposure to anoxia, the longer the time required for recovery. The dimensionless slope of the line is 0.399 (F1,36 = 169.0, P<10−6). Each point shown is the mean value for the number of flies (out of 8) that recovered; these are 8 for all anoxia durations except 90 minutes (5 recovered) and 120 minutes (only one recovered). Error bars are standard errors. The curves enclose the 95% confidence limits of the line fitted to data pooled by anoxia duration. Spiracular area, as traced by water vapor output, slowly increased after reperfusion began, and reached a maximum before returning again to lower levels. The time taken for water vapor output to reach peak levels, relative to the peak value of the CO2 “recovery spike”, was significantly affected by the duration of anoxic exposure. The longer the exposure to anoxia, the slower the response of the spiracles (F1, 46 = 228.8, P<10−6). Anoxia duration explains >83% of the variance in spiracle response delay. The 10-second peak value of WLR was not, however, affected by the duration of anoxic exposure, and was 0.1553±0.0122 mg hr−1. This did not differ significantly from the peak magnitude of the WLR peak that occurred after initial exposure to anoxia (t = 1.02, P>0.3). The degree to which WLR (and thus spiracular area) returned to lower levels after reperfusion was highly significantly affected by the duration of anoxic exposure. We assessed the extent to which this recovery occurred by examining the WLR for 20 minutes after reperfusion, and finding the most stable reading over a three-minute window during that time. The stable reading occurred after the initial peak of WLR, and allowed us–by comparison with pre-anoxic WLR values–to assess the recovery of neuromuscular integrity following reperfusion. Longer durations of anoxic exposure caused incomplete spiracular recovery and thus higher post-reperfusion WLRs (Fig. 2B). However, this was not a simple linear relationship. As defined above, optimum recovery occurred after 30 minutes of anoxic exposure. Thus the best recovery from anoxia (closest return to pre-anoxia WLR, and thus spiracular control, levels) occurred following exposure to the intermediate anoxia durations that caused a distinct secondary CO2 emission peak (Fig. 2A), which we hypothesized might be repair-related. Recovery of voluntary motor control following anoxia was assayed by the resumption of voluntary activity detected by the photoelectric activity sensor. The flies recovered voluntary motor control following anoxia after an interval of time that was linearly related to the duration of anoxic exposure (Fig. 2C). The slope of this relation, which is dimensionless and which we propose calling the anoxic recovery coefficient (ARC), was 0.399±0.031. This ARC is much steeper than reported elsewhere (0.14) over this range of anoxia durations [26]. This is presumably because our flies were exposed to practically immediate and complete hypoxia, rather than being subjected to prolonged first-order dilution washout in a container flushed with nitrogen. All of the 8 flies exposed to anoxia for each duration up to and including 60 minutes recovered. Of the 8 flies exposed to 90 minutes of hypoxia, 5 recovered; of the 8 flies exposed to 120 minutes of anoxia, only one recovered.Multiple reperfusions A single, 60 second reperfusion to normoxia in the middle of a 60 minute exposure to anoxia caused a large “recovery spike” of CO2 output and a peak of WLR as the spiracles opened (Fig. 3A). Unlike the case with a single reperfusion to sustained normoxia after 30 minutes or an hour of anoxia, normal spiracular control did not resume after this brief reperfusion. Water loss rate increased from 0.0523±0.0089 mg hr−1 (N = 8 male Drosophila) prior to the brief reperfusion to 0.1535±0.0243 mg hr−1 after the post-reperfusion WLR peak. This nearly three-fold increase in WLRs is highly significant (t = 3.91, df = 14, P = 0.001). Even after the second, sustained reperfusion, WLRs did not return to normal levels indicative of full spiracular function. Instead, they declined to only 0.1159±0.0235 mg hr−1, significantly higher than rates recorded prior to the first reperfusion (t = 2.53, P = 0.025) and not significantly different from the elevated levels shown after the first reperfusion (t = 1.11, P = 0.28). Whereas all of the flies subjected to an hour of anoxia survived a single reperfusion to sustained normoxia, only 5 of the 8 flies exposed to the same duration of anoxia interrupted by a 60 second burst of reperfusion followed again by anoxia survived the return to sustained normoxia.10.1371/journal.pone.0001267.g003Figure 3Effects of an oxygen reperfusion event followed by anoxia. Typical effects of 60 minutes of anoxia, interrupted by A) 1 minute of reperfusion with normoxia after 30 minutes, or B) multiple, 1 minute durations of reperfusion with normoxia, on the CO2 emission rate (VCO2; black), water loss rate (WLR; red) and activity (green; no units shown) of a male Drosophila melanogaster at 25°C. B = baselines. A = initiation of anoxia. R = reperfusion for 1 minute. N = return to normoxia. E = excretion events in the water vapor trace (red) after return to normoxia (approximately 1.75 and 2 hours); note the fast rise-times of these events. If a 60 second reperfusion was followed by a return to anoxia, as described above, and was then repeated multiple times at 20 minute intervals (Fig. 3B), the negative effect on spiracular function was cumulative and devastating (Fig. 4A). By the third reperfusion, WLR attained a sustained rate equivalent to the 10-second peak water output rate following a single, sustained reperfusion (0.1553±0.0122 mg hr−1). Meanwhile, the ability of the mitochondria to oxidize substrate declined highly significantly as the number of repeated reperfusions increased (Fig. 4B). Reperfusion injury is the parsimonious explanation for both effects. We assume that the repair of ROS-induced damage requires sustained reperfusion. Where reperfusion is intermittent and of short duration, ROS-induced damage that cannot be repaired in the absence of oxidative phosphorylation accumulates to an extent exceeding the ability of the flies to recover even when returned to continuous normoxia. It might be said that our technique “forces” reperfusion damage on an organism normally resistant to it. Obviously, quantitative determination of the ROS species involved, of the types of damage caused, and of the repair mechanisms impaired by repeated reperfusion, will be of considerable interest.10.1371/journal.pone.0001267.g004Figure 4Effects of multiple oxygen reperfusions. The effect of successive reperfusions on A) water loss rate (WLR which is inversely related to spiracular control integrity). Successive reperfusions rapidly elevated water loss rates, and thus diminished spiracular control integrity (F5, 30 = 19.91, P<10−6). B) the volume of CO2 released by mitochondrial activity. Successive reperfusions rapidly reduced mitochondrial activity (F5, 30 = 19.91, P<10−6). Considered as a linear regression using the points shown, reperfusion number explained >95% of mitochondrial activity variance (F1, 3 = 62.0, P = 0.004). The curves enclose the 95% confidence limits of the fitted line. The five reperfusions lasted for 60 seconds each and were spaced 20 minutes apart. Each point shown is the mean value for 6 flies. Error bars are standard errors. When using water vapor as a tracer gas for determining relative spiracular area, we are making the reasonable assumption that spiracular area is the primary determinant of variations in WLR (the cuticular component is continuous, and excretory events are easily recognized, e.g. Fig. 3A). We know that the spiracular area of D. melanogaster is variable and that this variability affects WLR [23] and, moreover, that spiracular area can respond rapidly to changes in external gas concentrations [15]. However, it is also possible that the water loss signals accompanying anoxic exposure and reperfusion may be due in part to modulations in the level of fluid in the tracheoles (the finely divided, distal branches of the tracheal system at which most gas exchange takes place, the surface area of which can be modulated by changes in fluid levels [27]). Direct observation of spiracular area may provide valuable additional information. In summary, the deleterious effects of anoxia and reperfusion injury are important from both the pure and the applied (biomedical) perspectives. Much comparative work has been carried out on adaptations to life without oxygen; however, the mechanisms of reperfusion injury at the mitochondrial level are poorly understood. Here we employed some of the “classical” techniques of insect respiratory biology to explore and quantify the dynamics of recovery from anoxia and reperfusion in Drosophila melanogaster. The use of Drosophila, with its well-characterized genome, short generation time and ease of care and handling, as a model organism for furthering research on ischemia and anoxia holds promise. Using gas exchange parameters to assay mitochondrial recovery and the integrity of spiracular control is a simple, non-invasive procedure. We hope that it may assist in elucidating mechanisms and in evaluating or screening relevant strains and treatments in this important area of research.MethodsAnimals We used male Oregon-R wild type Drosophila melanogaster between 5 and 15 days after eclosion for the measurements. They were reared and kept with media at a controlled temperature of 25±0.1°C.Respirometry We used a sensitive flow-through respirometry system (SI-1/TR-2-SA system, Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, NV, USA [SSI]), which serves to minimize temporal errors [21] and allows the metabolic dynamics of the effects of anoxia, and subsequent recovery in normoxia, to be followed in real time in individual flies. We supplemented the system with a SSI RH-300 water vapor analyzer set to measure water vapor density in µg ml−1. Activity was monitored using LED and phototransistor probes. Specimen temperatures were controlled at 25±0.1°C with an SSI PELT-5 temperature cabinet. SSI's SSI UI-2 analog measurement interface and ExpeData software were used for data acquisition and analysis. Switching from normal air to pure nitrogen (N2), i.e., anoxia, utilized a pair of solenoid valves controlled by the data acquisition software and hardware (Figure S1). In their quiescent state, the solenoids allowed ambient air scrubbed of water vapor and CO2 to be pulled through the respirometry system at a rate of 50 ml min−1. Energizing the solenoids (response time<50 milliseconds) caused the system to pull N2, which flowed into a manifold at 250 ml min−1, from that manifold instead. The N2 manifold eliminated pressure changes and allowed N2 to be pulled through the system at precisely the same flow rate as the normoxic air scrubbed of water vapor and CO2. The changeover from air to N2 took place in less than 10 seconds as measured with a SSI PA-10 paramagnetic O2 analyzer with a response time of <0.5 second. Very small CO2 and water vapor scrubbers (<2 ml internal volume) downstream from the solenoid assembly prevented any disturbance of the baseline water vapor or CO2 entering the fly chamber (volume<1.5 ml) during the transition. Baselines were taken automatically by the data acquisition system. We could program the system to give any desired exposure to anoxia and to take multiple baselines across long recordings to compensate for analyzer drift. The latter is crucial for long duration recordings measuring small CO2 and H2O concentration increments from tiny organisms such as individual Drosophila, which typically yield a CO2 signal of <1 ppm at these temperatures and flow rates. Bev-A-Line low-permeability tubing (Thermoplastic Processes Inc., Georgetown, DE, USA) was used throughout to minimize water vapor and CO2 absorbance errors. The chamber was a 6 mm i.d. polished bore through a 2.5 cm diameter×8 cm hexagonal nickel-plated aluminum rod, sealed with two thermally conductive sapphire windows (SSI isothermal Drosophila respirometry chamber). The polished bore allowed photoelectric detection through the sapphire windows of any movement by a single fly anywhere in the chamber. Two ports allowed passage of H2O-free and CO2-free air which was thermally equilibrated with the temperature of the cabinet by traveling through a 2 mm i.d. serpentine path milled through the length of the aluminum stock [17]. Finally, air left the respirometry chamber (having gathered CO2 and H2O from the fly on its way), entered the RH-300 water vapor analyzer and traveled to the CO2 analyzer (see Figure S1).Procedure During a typical run, an individual male Drosophila was aspirated from the breeding container and placed in the chamber. The fly was minimally handled; no thermal or chemical tranquilization was applied. The recording began with a baseline segment to establish the zero points for the CO2 and water vapor analyzers. After that the CO2 and H2O released by the fly were measured for 24 minutes (plus another baseline). The incurrent air was changed to pure nitrogen (N2) for 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 90 or 120 minutes. For the 7.5 to 60 minutes of anoxia treatments, another 30 to 60 minutes (depending on the anoxia duration) was measured in normal air in order to determine recovery time, and the end baseline taken. For the longer runs, the recovery period lasted 100 or 180 minutes and both an intermediate and an end baseline was recorded. In the case of reperfusions to brief normoxia, air was switched through the chamber for 60 seconds and then the system was returned to anoxia. In some runs (see below) the 60 second normoxic reperfusion was repeated at 20 minute intervals. When the recording was complete, the fly was removed from the chamber and weighed to the nearest 1 µg using a Cahn C-32 ultramicrobalance (Cahn Instruments Inc., Cerritos, California). The mass of water lost during the recording, as determined from the respirometry data, was added to its post-recording weight [17]. Body mass and other relevant information were noted in the remarks of the saved file. Data were sampled at 1 Hz, using intra-sample finite impulse response digital filtration to reduce analyzer noise [21].Data analysis Recordings were analyzed using ExpeData software. For each recording, the CO2 and H2O baselines were subtracted assuming linear or, where necessary, curvilinear drift. CO2 in ppm was converted to µl h−1 and H2O vapor density in µg ml−1 was converted to WLR in mg h−1 (see [21] for formulae). Because the CO2 and H2O analyzers were plumbed sequentially, the lag in response times for those traces was corrected individually. Cabinet and ambient temperature and air flow rate during the recording were also recorded. Statistical summaries of selected sections of the recordings (means, etc.) were written to ExpeData's RudeStat spreadsheet where summary statistics were calculated and statistical tests were performed. Means are accompanied by SE (standard error of the mean) and N (sample size), and are compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA; >2 cases) or Student's t-test (2 cases). Regressions were by least squares, with significance testing by analysis of variance.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Not to scale.

As the effects of chronic alcohol consumption on diabetic state have been little studied, this study was conducted with the objective of evaluating the effect of alcohol in diabetic rats. For this study, the rats were divided into five groups ( = 6 in each group): normal control (NC), alcohol treatment (At), diabetic control (DC), diabetic plus alcohol treatment (D + At), diabetic plus glibenclamide treatment (D + Gli). Alcohol treatment was given to the diabetic rats for 30 days. During the period the blood glucose levels, and body weight changes were observed at regular intervals. The antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were assayed in the liver and kidney tissues. The blood glucose levels were significantly ( < 0.001) elevated and body weight significantly ( < 0.001) decreased in alcohol-treated diabetic rats. SOD and CAT activities were decreased and the MDA level increased significantly ( < 0.001) in alcohol-treated diabetic rats. Histopathological studies showed that alcohol damages the liver and kidney tissues in diabetic rats. These finddings concluded that the consumption of alcohol in diabetic rats worsens the condition. So the consumption of alcohol by diabetic subjects may be potentially harmful.	Diabetes mellitus affects every organ in the man including eyes, kidney, heart, and nervous system.

Introduction The prevalence of diabetes mellitus has increased in recent years, particularly type 2 diabetes, which is related to obesity and sedentary lifestyle.[1] The total number of people globally affected by diabetes was reported to be 171 million in 2000 and is projected to be 366 million by 2030, and the vast majority of these cases will be of type 2 diabetes.[2] Free radical production has been reported to be increased in patients with diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia appears to be the contributing factor for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which lower the concentrations of antioxidant enzymes.[3] Oxidative stress induced by a high glucose concentration plays a central role in complications of diabetes.[45] Oxidative stress induces the production of highly reactive oxygen radicals that are toxic to cells and has been attributed to protein glycation and/or glucose auto-oxidation owing to a hyperglycemic environment.[6] Oxygen radicals also interact with the lipid bilayer and produce lipid peroxides particularly in cell membranes.[5] Lipid peroxidation of cellular structures is thought to play an important role in complications of diabetes.[6] Alcoholic beverages are used universally and alcohol is the world's most widely used psychoactive drug, but chronic, excessive alcohol consumption leads to permanent organ damage or death. Alcohol is rapidly oxidized in the liver tissue to acetaldehyde and acetate by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), respectively.[7] Further alcohol consumption and diabetes disturb the balance between the pro- and antioxidant systems of the organism, thereby leading to the oxidative stress by generating free radicals or ROS,[8] which results in liver and kidney injury. There are limited reports on the influence of alcohol on a diabetic state. A J-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and diabetes has been reported by Hoffmeister et al.[9] Chronic excessive consumption of alcohol may lead to deleterious effects upon many organs and metabolism.[10] Diabetogenic effects of alcohol include its contribution to obesity, induction of pancreatitis, and disturbance of carbohydrate and glucose metabolism.[11] However, the harmful effects of alcohol abuse on the functions of liver, kidney, heart, immune system, and central and peripheral neural system are not yet known.[12] There are no reports on the effect of alcohol on antioxidant enzymes and blood glucose in diabetic rats. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of alcohol in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats by measuring blood glucose levels and assaying the antioxidant enzymes activities in liver and kidney tissues.Materials and MethodsAnimals Male Wistar albino rats aged 6 months and weighing 180 ± 20 g were obtained from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Karnataka, India. The rats were housed in clean polypropylene cages having six rats per cage and maintained in a temperature-controlled room (27 ± 2°C) with a photoperiod of a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. The rats were given standard pellet diet (Lipton Rat Feed, Ltd., Pune, Maharashtra, India) and water ad libitum throughout the experimental period. The experiments were carried out in accordance with CPCSEA guidelines and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (regd. no. 438/01/a/CPCSEA/ dt.17.07.2001, in its resolution number 9/IAEC/SVU/2001/dt. 4.03.2002).Chemicals Streptozotocin (STZ) was obtained from Sigma Chemicals (USA). All the other chemicals used were of analytical grade.Induction of Diabetes The animals were fasted overnight and diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of a freshly prepared solution of STZ (50 mg/kg body weight) in a 0.1 M cold citrate buffer (pH 4.5). The animals were considered as diabetic, if their blood glucose values were above 250 mg/dL on the third day after STZ injection.Grouping of Animals The rats were divided into five groups of six rats in each group and treated as follows: Normal control (NC): This group of rats received saline (0.9%), for a period of 30 days. Alcohol treatment (At): This group of rats received alcohol as described by Mallikarjuna et al.[13] orally with a dose of 20% (2 g/kg body weight) via an oral gavage tube for 30 days. Diabetic control (STZ 50 mg/kg body weight) (DC): STZ was given intraperitonially for the induction of diabetes in this group and this group of rats received saline (0.9%), for a period of 30 days. Diabetic plus alcohol treatment (D + At): Diabetic rats received alcohol at a dosage of 20% (2 g/kg body weight) for 30 days orally. Diabetic + glibenclamide treatment (D + Gli): Diabetic rats treated with glibenclamide (600 μg/kg body weight) in an aqueous solution via an oral gavage tube for 30 days. Biochemical Assays The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was assayed in the liver and kidney homogenates by the method of Misra and Fridovich[14] at 480 nm for 4 min on a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer. The activity was expressed as the amount of enzyme that inhibits the oxidation of epinephrine by 50%, which is equal to 1 U per milligram of protein. The catalase (CAT) activity was determined at room temperature by using the method of Aebi,[15] and the absorbance of the sample was measured at 240 nm for 1 min by a UV spectrophotometer. The extent of lipid peroxidation was estimated as the concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive malondialdehyde (MDA) by using the method of Ohkawa et al.[16] The blood glucose levels were measured by using an Accucheck glucometer (Roche, Germany).Statistical Analysis Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan's multiple comparison tests among data were carried out using SPSS (version 13.5; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and MS Office, Excel, software for the significance of the main effects (factors), and treatments along with their interactions. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.ResultsEffect of Alcohol on Blood Glucose and Body Weight Changes In alcohol-treated rats, there was increase in blood glucose levels. In diabetic rats with alcohol treatment, blood glucose levels were significantly (P < 0.001) higher than those in normal control, alcohol-treated and diabetic rats [Table 1].Table 1 Changes in blood glucose levels In the alcohol-treated group, the body weight was increased. However, in the diabetic group, the body weight decreased significantly (P<0.001) whereas in alcohol-treated diabetic rats, the body weights were decreased [Table 2].Table 2 Changes in body weightEffect of Alcohol on Antioxidant Enzymes in Liver and Kidney Tissues of Diabetic Rats A significant (P < 0.001) reduction in SOD and CAT activities are observed in alcohol-treated and diabetic control rats as compared to normal control rats. MDA levels were increased significantly (P < 0.001) in alcohol-treated and diabetic rats Furthermore in alcohol treated diabetic rats, we observed significantly (P < 0.001) low activities of SOD and CAT and a very high level of MDA [Figure 1].Figure 1 Changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities and MDA levels in the Liver and Kidney tissues of NC = normal control rats, At = alcohol treatment rats, DC = diabetic control rats, D + At = diabetic + alcohol treatment rats, D + Gli = diabetic + glibenclamide treatment ratsImpact of Alcohol on Histopathological Changes in Liver and Kidney Tissues of Diabetic Rats In STZ-induced diabetic control rats, severe tubular degeneration, degeneration of glomeruli, focal necrosis of tubules, cystic dilatation of tubules, and fatty infiltration in the kidney tissue were observed. The above pathological changes were enhanced in alcohol-treated diabetic rats and dilatation of Bowman's capsule and hyaline casts were also observed [Figure 2].Figure 2 Effect of alcohol on histopathological changes in STZ induced diabetic rat kidney Photomicrograph of normal control (NC) kidney showing 1.

Damaged hepatocytesDiscussion The present study was designed to investigate the effect of alcohol on blood glucose levels and antioxidant enzymes in STZ-induced diabetic rats. In the present investigation, diabetic rats showed the elevation in blood glucose levels, confirming abnormalities of glucose metabolism[17] and also due to the destruction of pancreatic beta cells by STZ reinforcing the view that STZ induces diabetes probably through the generation of free radicals[18] whereas in alcohol treatment (At) alone and combination treatment (D + At) groups, the blood glucose levels were increased. A number of researchers have reported that alcohol administration to diabetic rats elevates the blood glucose levels. Alcohol treatment has been implicated to induce beta cell dysfunction, increase insulin secretary responses, and enhance glucose disposal rates in subjects with diabetes.[19] In this study, alcohol treatment in the rats increased the body weight. This may be due to the deposition of lipids in adipose tissue and fluid accumulation in the organs. This finding is in agreement with previous findings of Rajakrishnan et al.[20] In the diabetic group, the body weight was decreased. Weight loss during diabetes is mainly related to urinary glucose excretion because cells use glucose for many functions. Another factor could be the osmotic diuresis resulting in hyperosmotic dehydration.[21] With alcohol treatment in diabetic rats, we observed significantly (P < 0.001) lower body weights compared to diabetic rats. This was due to the dehydration, excess utilization of proteins for the energy. So, in alcohol-treated diabetic rats, decreased body weight was observed. SOD scavenges the superoxide radical by converting it to H2O2 and oxygen. In the present study, the SOD activity was decreased in the diabetic group. Pari and Latha[22] also reported that the SOD activity was decreased in diabetic rats. The decrease in the SOD activity in diabetic rats could result from the inefficient scavenging of ROS, which might be implicated in the oxidative inactivation of enzymes and especially the deleterious effects due to the accumulation of superoxide radicals, or by glycosylation of the enzymes, which have been reported to occur in diabetes.[23] In the current investigation, we observed a decreased activity of SOD in the alcohol-treated group. Shanmugam et al.[24] and Mallikarjuna et al.[13] reported that alcohol administration depleted the SOD activity in the kidney and liver tissues of albino rats. Several studies have reported that alcohol consumption decreases the SOD activity in the liver, heart, brain, kidney muscle, and serum.[25] The reduced activity of SOD in the presence of alcohol may cause the accumulation of O2· ¯, H2O2, or the products of its decomposition. However, in the combination treatment group, i.e., alcohol-treated diabetic rats (D + At), the SOD activity was significantly (P < 0.001) decreased compared to that of the alcohol-treated group and diabetic control group. This may be due to the excessive production of free radicals and superoxide radicals, so the SOD activity was decreased to counter the same. In the present study, the CAT activity was decreased in diabetic rats. The reduced activity of CAT in kidney and liver tissues may result in a number of deleterious effects due to the accumulation of H2O2.[26] The CAT activity was also decreased in alcohol-treated (At) rats in the present study. The reduced activity of CAT in the presence of alcohol causes the accumulation of free radicals which are toxic in nature. Balasubramaniyan et al.[27] and Mallikarjuna et al.[13] reported that the CAT activity in kidney and liver was decreased in the alcohol-treated group. CAT helps to scavenge hydroxyl ions, so the CAT activity was lowered in alcohol-treated rats[28] whereas in the combination treatment (D + At) group, the CAT activity was significantly decreased (P < 0.001) compared to the alcohol-treated or diabetic group. This may be due to the excess production and accumulation of hydroxyl radicals. CAT helps in neutralizing these toxic hydroxyl radicals, so the CAT activity was decreased. The additive effects of alcohol are observed in diabetic animals causing a greater reduction in these two enzymes. In the current study, MDA levels were increased in diabetic rats. Previous studies have reported an increase in lipid peroxidation in the liver, kidney, and brain of diabetic rats.[29] Lipid peroxide-mediated tissue damage has been observed in type I and type II diabetes. Higher levels of lipid peroxides in plasma urine and renal proximal tubules were observed in diabetic rats. Kakkar et al.[30] also reported the same. Ostrowska et al.[31] reported a threefold higher concentration of lipid hydroperoxides in alcohol-treated rats compared to the control groups. During alcohol metabolism, potentially dangerous byproducts are generated including ROS which react with membrane lipids and cause lipid peroxidation leading to cell death.[32] In alcohol treated diabetic rats, we observed significantly (P < 0.001) higher levels of MDA compared to alcohol and diabetic groups. During combination treatment, more free radicals are produced, hence the MDA level was increased in combination treatment. The histopathological studies revealed that in the kidney tissue of alcohol-treated rats, tubular degeneration, necrosis of renal cells, and degeneration of Bowman's capsule were observed. In diabetic control rats, severe tubular degeneration, degeneration of glomeruli, focal necrosis of tubules, cystic dilatation of tubules, and fatty infiltration were observed. This might be associated with increased diuresis and renal hypertrophy in diabetic rats. The above-mentioned pathological changes were more severe in alcohol-treated diabetic rats. The dilatation of Bowmen's capsule and hyaline casts were also observed. The histopathological studies of the alcoholic liver showed the disruption of hepatocytes, sinusoids, and central vein. This proves that free radical production might cause hepatic damage. In the diabetic group, greater damage of hepatocytes, sinusoids, and central vein was observed Whereas in the alcohol-treated diabetic group, hepatocytes, sinusoids, and central vein were more severely degenerated. The histological evidence of alcohol-treated diabetic rats suggests that structural alterations at the end of 30 days are due to diabetic stress and alcoholic stress. Thus, in addition to elevated levels of blood glucose, histopathological observations also support the concept that alcohol produced additive effects, and hence renal, hepatic tissue damage in diabetic rats.Conclusion From this study, it was concluded that alcohol consumption appears as an aggravating factor in diabetes. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of alcohol on blood glucose levels and antioxidant enzymes in diabetic rats. However, further studies are necessary to confirm these effects.

RNAi is a cellular pathway wherein small RNAs control the expression of genes by either degrading homologous RNAs or preventing the translation of RNAs with partial homology. It has impacted basic biology on two major fronts. The first is the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate almost every cellular process and are required for some viral infections, including hepatitis C virus (HCV). The second front is the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) as the first robust tool for mammalian cellular genetics. This has led to the identification of hundreds of cellular genes that are important for HCV infection. There is now a major push to adapt RNAi technology to the clinic. In this review, we explore the impact of RNAi in understanding HCV biology, the progress in design of RNAi-based therapeutics for HCV, and remaining obstacles.

Many of these RNA functions have been and will continue to be probed for therapeutic applications. The earliest therapeutic nucleic acids explored were antisense oligonucleotides, typically short (13–25 nucleotides (nts)) single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules. Hybridization of an antisense molecule with its target RNA results in either degradation by RNase H or steric hindrance of the mRNA splicing or translational machinery [reviewed in 1]. In 1998, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the first antisense DNA drug, fomivirsen by Isis Pharmaceuticals, to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis in immuno-compromised patients [2], thus demonstrating that clinical application of therapeutic nucleic acids is an achievable goal. Ribozymes and aptamers are RNA molecules identified in the 1980’s that were also tested for therapeutic potential. Hammerhead ribozymes, a class of catalytic RNAs (∼40 nts), are of particular interest because of their ability to recognize and cleave at specific RNA sequences [3,4]. Aptamers are highly structured RNAs (25–40 nts) with a high affinity for their protein ligand making them useful as possible drug inhibitors. For example, the transactivation response (TAR) aptamer encoded by HIV-1 binds the viral transactivator of transcription protein (Tat), and when over-expressed in vitro, TAR renders cells resistant to HIV-1 replication [5]. The newest and most promising addition to the field of RNA therapeutics arose from the discovery of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in 1998 by eventual Nobel Prize recipients Fire and Mello [6]. In C. elegans, Fire et al. noted injection of long, double stranded (ds) RNAs (∼300–1000 nts) complementary to a specified mRNA was accompanied by efficient elimination of the targeted transcript. This phenotype could not be reproduced in mammalian cells until Elbashir et al. provided a major breakthrough [7]. They showed that target mRNAs could be silenced by the transfection of cells with chemically synthesized siRNAs, which were designed to mimic the native siRNAs produced by RNAi in other systems [7]. It was subsequently shown that short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), which mimic endogenous pre-miRNAs, could be expressed in cells and also yield effective target RNA silencing [8]. These studies have ushered in a new era of using siRNAs and shRNAs for mammalian genetics and therapeutic approaches. While RNAi-based therapeutics have not yet realized their considerable potential, much work is being done to advance these approaches into the clinic.2.The RNAi pathway RNAi is a conserved mechanism of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) identified in multiple organisms, from worms to plants to mammals. Much of the mechanism and key components of the RNAi pathway are now appreciated (Figure 1). In the cytoplasm, Dicer, a RNase III type enzyme, cleaves long dsRNAs into ∼21–25 nucleotide (nt) siRNAs, with 5′ phosphate groups and two nt 3′ overhangs [9,10]. The strand complementary to the target mRNA is called the guide strand while the other is called the passenger strand. Clues as to how Dicer recognizes its dsRNA substrate and how cleavage sites are chosen lie within its structure [11,12]. Dicer proteins usually contain a helicase/ATPase domain, two RNaseIII-like domains, a PAZ domain, and a dsRNA binding domain. The size of siRNAs produced are predicted by the distance between the PAZ and the RNaseIII domains, and the 3′ overhangs are a common feature produced by RNaseIII activity [11]. Several positively charged residues connecting these domains are thought to facilitate binding of RNA [11]. Dicer then delivers the siRNA to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), in part consisting of Dicer, argonaute proteins, and HIV-transactivating response RNA-binding protein (TRBP) [13]. Argonaute 2 (Ago2) is the catalytic endonuclease at the heart of human RISC that binds the siRNA duplex, cleaves and removes the passenger strand, and thus leaves behind an intact single-stranded guide [14,15]. The strand with least complementarity at the 5′ end tends to serve as the guide [16]. Furthermore, TRBP binds to the more thermodynamically stable end of the siRNA and orients it with Ago2 in a way that helps identify the guide strand [17]. The degree of complementarity between the guide and target mRNA determines whether the mRNA is degraded (exact match) or translationally repressed due to steric hindrance (partial homology) [18]. In the case of exact homology, the RNase H domain of Ago2 is responsible for target mRNA cleavage [14]. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) are the natural substrates for Dicer in mammals [reviewed in 18]. In the nucleus, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes genome-encoded primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) that can contain multiple hairpins [19]. A complex consisting of the RNase III enzyme Drosha and dsRNA binding protein DGCR8 cleaves the pri-mRNAs into 60–80 nt hairpins called pre-miRNAs [20]. Pre-miRNA hairpins are exported into the cytoplasm where they are recognized by Dicer and cleaved to generate the final miRNA duplex with characteristic two nt 3′ overhangs [20]. Novel Dicer-independent mechanisms for miRNA processing may also exist since it was reported that miR-451 cleavage relied only on Ago2 catalytic activity in zebrafish [21]. The majority of miRNA-derived guide strands have only partial target homology and are directed by RISC to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of mature mRNAs resulting in translational repression [22]. The “seed” region of the miRNA (nts 2–8 from 5′ end of the guide strand) is critical for recognition of target 3’UTRs [23]. More recently, it has been shown that central nucleotides can also guide substrate selection in some cases [24]. RNAi is now recognized as a critical regulator of virtually every cellular process. RNAi has become a preferred method to perform highly specific genetic manipulations for functional studies in cell culture. RNAi studies have also greatly expanded the repertoire of possible drug targets to treat metabolic and genetic disorders, cancer, or viral infections. The underlying principle for RNAi-based therapy is to trigger PTGS using mimics of Dicer substrates (Figure 1): either chemically synthesized siRNAs or virally expressed shRNAs. Synthetic siRNAs can be delivered to Dicer in the cytosol by a variety of delivery approaches. shRNAs encoded in viral delivery vectors must be exported and processed by the endogenous miRNA pathway. A study by Song et al. demonstrated the first in vivo siRNA application for disease therapy [25]. They showed that systemic delivery of siRNA duplexes targeting Fas, a mediator of hepatitis and fibrosis, resulted in hepatocyte-uptake and protected the treated mice from liver injury in a fulminant hepatitis mouse model. More in vivo studies for other diseases soon followed supporting the efficacy of siRNA-based therapies [reviewed in 26, 27]. An array of antiviral RNAi therapies have been corroborated in animal models, for example, influenza [28, 29], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [30, 31], parainfluenza virus [30], coxsackievirus B [32], SARS-associated coronavirus [33], West Nile virus [34], and herpes simplex virus (HSV-2) using a topical application [35].3.RNAi and HCV RNAi is considered an endogenous antiviral mechanism in plants and insects, but it is unlikely to be a robust antiviral pathway in mammalian somatic cells [36]. However, there is some evidence for limited antiviral activity of RNAi in mammalian cells. Minor processing of HCV RNAs, in addition to those of other viruses, into small RNAs during infection has been reported [37]. Interestingly, mammalian viruses that replicate in mosquito vectors, in which RNAi is a primary antiviral pathway, had extremely low levels of small RNAs identified in this study. This suggests that viruses that successfully infect insects may have evolved counter-strategies to RNAi. On the other hand, viruses that do not replicate in insect vectors, such as HCV, had higher levels of short viral RNAs, suggesting an absence of evolutionary pressure in mammals to express RNAi antagonists. Contrary to the idea that RNAi is a mammalian antiviral mechanism, HCV in fact utilizes RNAi to support its infection. HCV replication and infectious virus production were inhibited when components of the RNAi pathway, including Dicer, were silenced by siRNAs [38]. This is likely related to a downstream processing effect: the loss of cellular miRNA-122 (miR-122). miR-122 is the most abundant miRNA in the liver [39] and studies suggest it plays a role in fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism [40]. During HCV infection, miR-122 binds to the 5’UTR of the HCV genome and regulates both HCV translation and replication by unknown mechanisms [41–44]. It has been shown that genotype 1b HCV replicon replication can be inhibited by sequestering miR-122 [41], and infectious J6/JFH-1 replication and virus production can be inhibited by anti-miR-122 RNAs [38]. A much more detailed description of HCV therapeutic approaches targeting miR-122 is described in this special issue of Viruses by Catherine Jopling [45]. Many other viruses, particularly the herpesviruses, co-opt the RNAi pathway by expressing viral miRNAs that modulate either cellular or viral gene expression [reviewed in 46]. Consistent with the lack of an HCV RNAi antagonist, many groups have shown that HCV replication is exquisitely sensitive to either chemically synthesized siRNAs or shRNA expression targeting HCV RNA. It was reported that siRNAs directly targeting HCV replicon RNAs, specifically at the 5′ untranslated region (UTR), core, NS3, NS4B, or NS5A, were effective at reducing viral replication and suggests siRNAs can be designed against most regions of the HCV genome [47–52]. The in vitro efficacy of siRNAs against fully infectious HCV has also been shown [38]. While the majority of HCV-siRNAs are complementary to the (+) strand, a reduction in both strands of the viral dsRNA replication intermediate has been observed [53]. It is plausible that targeting the (+) strand template indirectly leads to a decrease in synthesis of (−) strands. Although HCV mouse models are very limited, some groups have reported RNAi of HCV transgene expression in mice. One in vivo mouse study reported shRNAs specific to the HCV 5’UTR were effective at diminishing HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-driven luciferase expression [54]. Another study using a similar method in mice reported silencing of a NS5B-luciferase transgene by NS5B-specific siRNAs [55]. Because dsRNAs can activate the interferon (IFN) pathway, it was necessary to address whether HCV-specific siRNAs could trigger IFN production. Kapadia et al. demonstrated that inhibition of viral replication by HCV RNAi in vitro was not associated with an upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes [47]. In fact, HCV siRNAs were better at reducing HCV RNA levels than high doses of IFN-α [47]. An analysis of combined RNAi and IFN treatment of HCV replicons in cell culture using lentivirus-delivered shRNAs has been performed. Results indicated that IFN-α did not interfere with gene silencing, and inhibition of HCV replication by HCV-specific shRNAs was enhanced by addition of IFN-α [56]. This underscores the possibility of combination therapies of siRNAs and IFN against HCV. In addition to directly targeting the virus, one important use of RNAi in the HCV therapeutic arena that is likely to have success is the identification of novel drug targets by RNAi. In general, this approach uses siRNAs or shRNAs targeting cellular genes to identify host cofactors of HCV infection. Small molecule inhibitors can then be developed against the identified drug targets. Although host genes have traditionally been overlooked as antiviral targets, there is growing interest in the potential of host targets to minimize viral resistance and possibly for use as broad-spectrum antivirals. RNAi has been used on a small scale to verify that cofactors, such as CD81, PTB, La antigen, and VAP-A are important for HCV replication [57,58]. Many groups have recently published medium-to-high-throughput RNAi screens that identified hundreds of host factors utilized by HCV [38,59–64]. Identification of cellular proteins with enzymatic functions is ideal for development of novel, small molecule inhibitors and/or therapeutic siRNAs. Two such candidates are ubiquitin specific peptidase 18 (USP18) and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha (PI4K-IIIα). siRNAs targeting USP18 have been shown to potentiate the ability of IFN-α to inhibit HCV replication and virus production [65]. PI4K-IIIα siRNAs dramatically reduce HCV replication suggesting this is a critical viral replication cofactor [61–64,66,67]. The identification and characterization of host cofactors utilized during HCV infection using RNAi technology is a significant advancement towards discovery of much needed new, therapeutic targets.4.Advantages & pitfalls of RNAi therapeutics Since HCV is a major public health burden and the current HCV therapy of IFN and ribavirin is successful in only half of treated patients [68], there are many alternative therapeutics under development. Most of these are traditional small molecule approaches inhibiting the function of viral proteins. RNAi-based antiviral strategies have a number of distinct advantages and disadvantages as compared with these therapies, which are discussed below. One of the primary advantages is that siRNAs are easy to design and synthesize, unlike small molecule inhibitors. Several guides and algorithms exist to aid in the choice of siRNA [69]. siRNAs must be experimentally tested for efficacy, but this is relatively trivial and typically amenable to high-throughput analysis. They also have a distinct target (RNA for siRNAs, versus protein for small molecule inhibitors), which yields promise for inclusion in multiple drug cocktails with distinct targets to limit viral escape. However, significant challenges remain with respect to RNAi therapy of HCV infection. The first obstacle is the relative ease of viral resistance to a siRNA drug. HCV has a high mutation rate due to its error prone viral RNA polymerase, which leads to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. In one study, siRNA-resistant HCV replicons emerged after four weeks of HCV-siRNA therapy with specific mutations in the target sequence [70]. In order to minimize the risk of drug resistance, multiple viral and/or cellular targets must be considered, as is the case with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV. Delivery of multiple HCV siRNAs in parallel can be effective at limiting escape mutants [53,71]. Alternatively, siRNAs could be also combined with IFN treatment or viral protease and polymerase inhibitors. Another approach is to identify highly conserved regions of the HCV genome that are susceptible to siRNAs. These sequences should be less likely to mutate and provide resistance. Another problem is the poor stability of siRNAs in serum which last only minutes due to the high concentration of nucleases present in blood [72]. However, naked siRNAs can be masked with chemical modifications for stability while maintaining sequence specificity [reviewed in 73]. A 2′-O-methyl addition is the most commonly used modification. The use of a phosphorothioate backbone linkage at the 3′ end or a 2′-fluoro sugar modification also offers protection against nuclease activity [74,75]. Furthermore, incorporation of fluoro-β-D-arabinonucleic acid or arabinonucleic acid can increase serum stability and potency [76,77]. siRNAs may deviate from their intended target and alter the expression from unintended mRNAs, which is termed an “off-target effect”. Off-target activity can occur when siRNAs target RISC to the 3’UTR of an unintended mRNA. This activity is mapped to the “seed” region described for miRNAs [78]. For miRNAs, translational repression occurs when there is exact pairing between the seed region (nts 2–8 of the guide strand) and its target 3’UTR, although a partial seed match can also trigger silencing given that there is sufficient base-pairing in other regions of the miRNA. This flexibility makes it difficult to predict potential off-target activity. For synthetic RNAs, RISC can integrate siRNAs into the miRNA pathway to produce translational repression of unintended mRNAs containing seed region homology. However, chemical modifications at nucleotide 2 of the seed region greatly reduce off-target effects. These include 2′-O-methyl, 2′-fluoro, 2’deoxy, or locked nucleic acids (LNAs) [79]. Additionally, a pool of siRNAs could be used wherein the concentration of an individual siRNA is reduced, thus minimizing off-target mRNA repression while enhancing specificity. Unintended activation of the innate immune response is another complication. Some siRNAs have been shown to trigger innate immunity leading to cytokine and interferon production [80–82]. dsRNAs >30 nts activate protein kinase PKR and 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase [83], but shorter siRNA duplexes minimize this activation. siRNAs can also be recognized by the mammalian toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, 7, and 8 [81,84]. TLR3 is a dsRNA sensor, while TLR7 and 8 recognize ssRNA and dsRNA motifs. siRNAs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or its receptor are being clinically tested for treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Interestingly, it was discovered that siRNAs from two different clinical trials interacted with and activated TLR3, thereby indirectly downregulating VEGF [85]. Thus, the siRNA activity is not sequence-specific and is unrelated to the RNAi mechanism. Some siRNAs can bind to TLR7 in a sequence-specific manner [81], but this can be remedied in some cases by adding a 2′-O-methyl modification [86]. Lastly, guanosine and uracil rich regions should be avoided in siRNA design as these may contribute to siRNA recognition by TLR7 and TLR8 [87,88]. An undesired off-target effect unique to viral delivery of shRNAs is the saturation of the RNAi machinery. Over-expression of shRNAs was found to saturate nuclear exportin 5, thereby inhibiting nuclear export and activity of cellular miRNAs [89]. Adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) is an attractive delivery vehicle for HCV therapies due to its improved liver transduction efficiency over other AAV vectors [90]. In a study by Grimm et al., long-term over-expression of shRNAs from an AAV8 vector, delivered intravenously in mice, resulted in liver injury that was often fatal [91]. Again, this phenotype was pinpointed to competition between the shRNA and host miRNAs for limiting cellular factors. In theory, toxicity can be controlled by lowering the shRNA dosage, either by decreasing the amount of virus or the strength of shRNA promoter. Despite the disadvantages mentioned, several RNAi-based therapies have successfully made it to clinical trials. As with any potential therapeutic, issues of unintended consequences, such as toxicity, should be evaluated in standard pharmacokinetic and phase I safety studies.5.siRNA drugs in clinical trials siRNA drugs are promising treatments for many diseases [reviewed in 92–94]. The first generation of therapies was designed to treat wet AMD, the major cause of blindness in the United States in patients over the age of 55. The first highly anticipated siRNA therapy to advance to phase III clinical trials was intravitreal injection of bevasiranib (Opko Health), designed to target VEGF for treatment of wet AMD. While it showed promising activity in combination with an anti-VEGF antibody, ranibizumab (Genentech), the trial was predicted not to reach its therapeutic potential and was terminated in March 2009 [95]. In a collaboration between Merck-siRNA Therapeutics and Allergan, the AMD drug called AGN211745 (formerly sirna-027), which is a chemically modified siRNA targeting VEGF receptor 1, also held promise but did not pass phase II trials in 2009 [95]. Despite these two setbacks, PF-4523655 (formerly RTP801i-14) from Quark Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer is a siRNA currently in phase II trials for use in AMD and also diabetic macular degeneration. Using a more advanced approach, CALAA-01 (Calando Pharmaceuticals) is a RNAi therapeutic candidate for treatment of solid tumors and consists of transferrin-coated cyclodextrin nanoparticles containing siRNAs that target the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2), a cancer target [96]. A recent report shows that systemic administration of CALAA-01, currently in phase 1 trials, specifically inhibits the intended mRNA transcript in humans [96], unlike the off-target effects reported for other clinical RNAi therapies [85]. This is the first evidence of a RNAi therapeutic in humans that indeed works by a RNAi mechanism. Dependent on upregulated transferrin receptors in cancer cells, this is also the first clinical siRNA therapy to utilize receptor-mediated delivery. Silence Therapeutics AG has developed a unique siRNA-lipoplex formulation to target protein kinase N3 (PKN3), an effector of the PI3-kinase pathway [97]. This drug (Atu027) is being explored in phase I trials for anti-angiogenesis therapy of advanced solid cancers. siRNA-mediated treatment to boost the immune response against metastatic melanoma is also in phase I (Duke University). For this study, patients are injected with autologous dendritic cells transfected with melanoma tumor antigen expression constructs and siRNAs targeting the immunoproteosome [98], presumably to enhance melanoma antigen presentation. The first antiviral siRNA drug approved for clinical trials targets respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV causes respiratory tract infections that are most severe in children. ALN-RSV01 (Alnylam Pharmacuetical) targets the RSV nucleocapsid and inhibits viral replication in the lung [99]. Findings from phase II trials, involving healthy adults experimentally inoculated with RSV, have now been published [99]. Both prevention and treatment modalities were incorporated into the trial design. In either modality, viral loads were diminished in patients treated with ALN-RSV01 as compared to placebo. However, the most significant antiviral effect was observed when it was administered prophylactically. A phase II trial testing efficacy of ALN-RSV01 in naturally infected lung transplant patients has been completed and now a phase IIb has begun [98]. Benitec, in collaboration with the City of Hope National Medical Center in California, published its phase I clinical trial for RNAi therapy of HIV-1 in June 2010 [100]. Autologous CD34+ cells from HIV patients with AIDS-related lymphoma were modified with a triple combination vector (rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ) consisting of a shRNA targeting a tat/rev exon, a TAR RNA decoy, and a CCR5 targeting hammerhead ribozyme. This combination afforded long term suppression of HIV replication in a prior in vitro study [101], and the clinical results show it is feasible, well tolerated in patients, and has sustained expression up to 24 months [100]. Lastly, the safety of a therapeutic for HCV that targets miR-122 is being analyzed in phase I clinical trials. SPC3649 (Santaris Pharma) is a LNA-modified phosphorothioate oligonucleotide that was published to effectively silence miR-122 in African green monkeys [102] and produce prolonged suppression of viremia without HCV resistance in chronically infected chimpanzees [103] with tolerated reduction in cholesterol levels. Phase I clinical trials of SPC3649 began this year, with a competing anti-miR-122 antiviral developed by GlaxoSmithKline and Regulus Therapeutics scheduled for phase I trial in 2011 [104]. These clinical studies pave the way to designing effective RNAi strategies in patients.6.The final frontier for RNAi therapeutics for HCV: effective siRNA delivery to the liver The major challenge now is to progress from HCV in vitro “proof of concept” studies to in vivo therapeutic approaches using siRNAs or shRNAs. This has been especially challenging for HCV due to limited animal models. The greatest breakthrough for HCV RNA therapeutics thus far has not been siRNAs or shRNAs, but the anti-miR-122 drug SPC3649, which to date is the only successful treatment in a HCV animal model supportive of these approaches. By far the biggest hurdle in HCV siRNA therapy is the efficient delivery of siRNAs to the cytosol of infected hepatocytes. This entails maximizing both the uptake of siRNA by the liver and the escape of siRNAs from the endocytic compartments into the cytosol. The liver is an attractive organ for uptake of nucleic acids following systemic delivery as evidenced by several reports showing naked siRNAs are readily taken up by the liver in mice using hydrodynamic tail vein injection [25,55,105,106]. This delivery approach involves rapid, large volume injection and is not amenable to use in humans. The amounts of siRNAs required for a therapeutic effect against hepatitis B virus (HBV) using intravenous injection in an animal model were an order of magnitude above conceivable therapeutic doses in people [106]. Nevertheless, this method was important in first demonstrating siRNA efficacy in hepatocytes in vivo. There are multiple approaches being taken to improve uptake and delivery to the liver, which are outlined below. One approach to improve specific organ delivery is conjugation of siRNAs to biologically relevant molecules. The strategy behind lipophilic modifications to siRNAs depends on binding to lipoproteins and internalization by low-density or high-density lipoprotein (LDL or HDL) receptors, which are highly expressed in the liver. Intravenous injection of cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs for apolipoprotein B (apoB) was effective at silencing transcripts in the liver and jejunum of mice, resulting in lowered cholesterol levels [107]. siRNAs conjugated to bile-salt derivatives or long chain fatty acids were also found to trigger RNAi in hepatocytes in vivo [108]. Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) is incorporated into lipoproteins after consumption, including LDLs and HDLs [109]. With this in mind, Nishina et al. showed that α-tocopherol-conjugated siRNAs (Toc-siRNAs) specific to apoB were effectively delivered and processed by Dicer in livers of mice without stimulating IFN production [110]. The negatively charged plasma membrane, circulating nucleases present in serum, and rapid clearance by the renal system impede uptake of siRNAs. One approach to overcome issues of membrane charge and nucleases is the incorporation of siRNAs into multilayered polyelectrolyte films (MPFs), which consist of alternating layers of polycations and polyanions wherein siRNAs are semi-protected from spontaneous release or diffusion until cell uptake [111]. Using this method, Dimitrova et al. showed effective and sustainable inhibition of HCV replication in cell culture using HCV siRNAs complexed within MPFs [111]. Another approach is the use of stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALPS) which contain siRNAs within a combination of cationic and fusogenic lipids coated with polyethelene glycol (PEG) [106]. SNALPS have been successfully used to deliver anti-HBV siRNAs to inhibit HBV replication in mouse hepatocytes and to deliver anti-apoB siRNAs in mice and monkeys [106,112]. Other types of cationic lipid-based vehicles have been developed based on a library of cationic lipid-like molecules, called lipidoids, that were generated by adding primary or secondary amines to alkyl-acrylates or alkyl-acrylamides [113]. The leading compound identified, 98N12-5(1), when combined with cholesterol and PEG lipid, effectively encapsulated and delivered siRNAs to mouse hepatocytes. Although, cationic liposomes have improved hepatic delivery, siRNA uptake is often observed in other organs. Also, liposome-siRNA based technologies face the problem of escaping the endosome once they are internalized. Endosomal release can be facilitated by incorporating fusogenic peptides and ligands or by using pH-sensitive nanocomplexes [reviewed in 114]. A unique technology called dynamic polyconjugates (DPCs) addresses issues of cell-specific targeting and endosomal escape. DPCs consist of the hepatocyte targeting ligand N-acetylgalactosamine conjugated to PEG (used as a shielding agent to prevent non-specific interactions of the nanoparticle) and to an endosomolytic polymer that is activated only in the acidic environment of the endosome. Using a single simple intravenous injection of anti-apoB siRNAs carried by DPCs, Rozema et al. reported specific reduction of apoB mRNA in the liver (hepatocytes specifically and not Kupffer cells) and not in the jejunum of mice [115], thus demonstrating the effectiveness of utilizing a targeting ligand. Viral vectors are another means of triggering RNAi in hepatocytes. shRNAs are cloned into viral vectors under control of Pol II or Pol III promoters and typically packaged into lentivirus, adenovirus, or AAV particles. Viral encoded and delivered shRNAs have the benefit of long-term expression in dividing and non-dividing cells and incorporation of target ligands. To direct viral vectors to specific cells, target ligands can be incorporated into the viral particles or liver-specific RNA pol promoters used to drive shRNA expression. Viruses that have a natural tropism for certain tissues can be used, as in the case of hepatropic AAV8. However, as mentioned earlier, the downside of viral-encoded shRNAs is RNAi saturation and toxicity [91].7.Conclusions and outlook The identification of RNAi in mammalian cells is less than a decade old. However, the field has dramatically altered our fundamental understanding of gene regulation in almost every setting. It is clear that there is an enormous potential for RNAi-based therapies, which is as of yet unrealized. In the case of HCV, RNAi therapies will not be the next generation of antivirals to emerge from clinical trials. These almost certainly will be more classical protease and polymerase small molecule inhibitors that will be used in combination with IFN and ribavirin. Nevertheless, it is clear that additional therapeutic strategies involving novel targets will likely be required to treat patients who fail to respond to this combination therapy, which is proposed to be ∼15–25% of treated patients [116]. It is possible that RNAi therapeutics may be one of the next generations of drugs to help fill this niche. The compelling strength of RNAi therapeutic approaches is that once the proper modifications are designed to minimize off-target effects, while maximizing effective delivery of siRNAs or shRNAs to the hepatic cytosol, they are universally applicable to any liver target. Only the siRNA nucleotide sequence needs to change in order to target any hepatotropic virus or liver gene target, e.g. to treat diseases with elevated LDL or cholesterol. Thus, if the issues with effective delivery are overcome, it will be trivial to apply this technology to many different hepatotropic diseases.

Introduction ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates the transport of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to lipid-poor apolipoproteins. Animals and human studies documented that defects in the ABCA1 pathway are significant determinants of coronary artery disease (CAD) [1]. Inactivation of ABCA1 gene in macrophages increases atherosclerotic lesions in hyperlipidemic mice [2,3], and overexpressing human ABCA1 in transgenic mice retards atherogenesis [4,5]. The ABCA1 gene is located on the chromosome 9 in the area 9q31.1 and encodes ABCA1 protein. ABCA1 protein is expressed in liver, macrophages, intestines, lungs etc. Several ABCA1 gene polymorphisms were identified such as rs2230806 (R219K) in the chromosomal position 107620867, rs2230808 (R1587K) in the chromosomal position 106602625 and rs4149313 (I883M) in the chromosomal position 106626574]. This study in line with our previous work [6] was undergone to evaluate the association of gender, three ABCA1 gene polymorphisms mention above and lipid profile in Greek male and female nurses.Materials and methodsSubjects The genotyping of 447 (87 male) nurse students median age 22 (21–25) years old, who were attended to the University of Nursing of Technological and Educational Institution, was performed. All students had no personal history of CAD and were not taking any drugs. Other exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, thyroid and liver disease, high alcohol consumption, professional athleticism and any chronic disease. All students were attended to the University every day and were staying for 8–10 hours. Students were eating (breakfast, snacks and lunch) at the school canteen which served typical Mediterranean food. Only one meal daily (dinner) was most likely to be different in each student. The University of Nursing of Technological and Educational Institution Ethics Committee approved the protocol of this study. All subjects signed an informed consent form.Blood chemistry Plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1) were measured using enzymatic colorimetric methods on Roche Integra Biochemical analyzer with commercially available kits (Roche). The serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration was calculated using the Friedewald formula only in subjects with TGs concentration < 400 mg/dl.DNA analysis and determination of blood lipids The ABCA1 gene polymorphisms (R219K, R1587K and I883M) were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restricted fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP’s). The PCR was performed using Taq polymerase KAPATaq. The oligonucleotide primers used for R219K and R1587K polymorphisms were described by Saleheen D et al.[7] and Tupitsina TV et al.[8] respectively. The oligonucleotide primers used for I883M polymorphism were 5’-GAGAAGAGCCACCCTGGTTCCAACCAGAAGAGGAT-3’ and 5’- AGAAAGGCAGGAGACATCGCTT −3 as described by Clee SM et al.[9]. PCR was subjected to 95 οC for 5 min, thirty cycles of 95 οC for 30 s, 65 οC for 30 s and 72 οC for 30 s and final extension to 72 οC for 7 min, producing a fragment of 132 bp. This fragment was subsequently cleaved by EcorV, creating fragments for I allele 97 bp and 35 bp and for M allele 132 bp, which were subjected to electrophoresis on an agarose gel 4% and visualized with ethidium bromide (Figure 1).Figure 1 Gel electrophoresis of I883M gene polymorphismStatistical analysis The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to test for normal distribution of continuous variables. The results are given as median and interquartile range (IQR), whereas, all qualitative variables are presented as absolute or relative frequencies. The Mann–Whitney U test or the Fisher’s exact test was employed for comparison of continuous or categorical variables, respectively. The comparison within groups was performed by test for equality of proportions (Bonferroni correction). The Kruskal – Wallis H statistic was employed in order to detect differences in lipid levels according to three different polymorphisms of ABCA1 gene (R219K, R1587K and I883M). ABCA1 polymorphisms’ distribution according to lipid profile was tested using the Kruskal Wallis test in men, in women and in all patients. All results were corrected for multiple testing (Bonferroni correction). All tests were two-tailed and statistical significance was established at 5% (p < 0.05). Data were analysed using Stata ™ (Version 10.1 MP, Stata Corporation, College Station, TX 77845, USA).Results Comparison of various characteristics according to gender showed that the study group was homogenous regarding age (p > 0.05) (Table 1). However, significant differences were detected regarding other anthropometric characteristics and lipidemic profile (Table 1). Specifically, BMI, waist and mean blood pressure measurements were higher in men when compared to women (Table 1). Moreover, TG levels were significantly elevated in men, whereas HDL-C and Apo A1 levels were significantly elevated in women. No differences were detected for TC measurements between men and women (Table 1).Table 1 Characteristics of the study population Men(n = 87)Women(n = 360)Total(n = 447)P*Anthropometric dataAge (years)21 [20–25]23 [21–25]22 [21–25]0.13BMI (Kg/m2)24 [22–26]23 [20–24]22 [20–25]<0.001Waist (cm)92 [87–97]87 [80–94]88 [81–95]<0.001Mean BP (mmHg)87 [80–90]83 [76.7-90]87 [80–90]0.007Lipid profile (mg/dl)Total Cholesterol204 [155–250]198 [158–238]198 [158–240]0.38Triglycerides131 [97–185]89 [61–152]97 [65–167]<0.001HDL cholesterol59 [46–76]66 [52–83]65 [51–82]0.01LDL cholesterol108 [74–149]105 [76–128]106 [76–132]0.25Apo A1114 [96–154]153 [111–189]147 [107–183]<0.001Other variablesSmoking (yes/no) - (%)48/38(56%-44%)127/207(38%-62%)175/245(42%-58%)0.003History of CAD (yes/no) - (%)12/68(15%-85%)79/228(26%-74%)91/296(23.5%-76.5%)0.04 *Comparisons are made according to sex. Statistical tests performed: Mann–Whitney U test or Pearson’s chi-square test were employed for comparison of continuous or categorical data, respectively. The distribution of all ABCA1 gene polymorphisms studied did not differ according to gender (Table 2). However, only R219K distribution bared borderline significance between the two groups studied (Table 2). A post hoc power calculation was conducted employing the calculated differences in the distribution of R219K polymorphism between men and women. The post hoc power (<0.6) was not sufficient enough to support the hypothesis. Furthermore, none of the comparisons within groups (concerning the rest of the polymorphisms) were statistically significant (p > 0.1). Moreover, allele frequencies of R219K, R1587K and I88M polymorphisms did not differ according to gender (Table 2).Table 2 Distribution of R219K, R1587K and I883M polymorphisms and allele frequencies according to sex Men(n = 87)Women(n = 360)PR219K   RR39 (17.3%)186 (82.7%)0.08*RK45 (23.8%)144 (76.2%)KK3(9.4%)29 (90.6%)R1587K   RR37 (17.5%)174 (82.5%)0.12*RK45 (23.5%)146 (76.5%)KK5 (11.4%)39 (88.6%)I883M   II64 (20.7%)245 (79.3%)0.66*IM22 (17.2%)106 (82.8%)MM1 (12.5%)7 (87.5 %)Allele frequencies for R219K polymorphismR allele frequency0.710.720.85**K allele frequency0.290.28Allele frequencies for R1587K polymorphismR allele frequency0.680.690.85**K allele frequency0.320.31Allele frequencies for I883M polymorphismI allele frequency0.860.830.4**M allele frequency0.170.14 Fisher’s exact test - **Test for equality of proportions.

In previous study we evaluated the influence of ABCA1 gene polymorphisms on lipid profile in female Greek nurses. In the present study, we assessed more subjects, included men and evaluated one more polymorphism, namely rs4149313 (I883M).R219K polymorphism One of the first study which evaluated the R219K polymorphism and lipid profile in man was published by Clee SM et al.[9]. They genotyped 804 Dutch men with CAD who were participated in the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS). The frequency of K allele in their study was similar to our study (25.4% and 28%, respectively). They found that K allele carriers had decreased progression of atherosclerosis and a reduced risk of coronary events. Furthermore, the K allele was associated with lower plasma TGs concentration and a trend toward higher HDL-C concentration. Since then, many other studies correlated the R219K variant with the lipid profile and risk for CAD in various populations and ethnicities [6,9-16]. Conversely, Pasdar et al. [10] did not support a major role of the ABCA1 gene as risk factor for ischemic stroke. Srinivasan et al.[11] found that the K219 allele frequency differs markedly between blacks and whites, and that the variant-allele modulates the association between age and HDL-C, as well as body fatness and TGs concentration in a beneficial manner only in whites. Bertolini et al. [12] found that in subjects with CAD, the prevalence of RK and KK genotypes was lower than in subjects free of CAD (33.0% versus 51.5%). Zhao et al. [13] found a significant upward trend in the sequence of RR, RK, and KK genotypes with a significant difference between RR genotype (50.5 ± 15.6 mg/dl, 1.3 mmol/l ± 0.4 mmol/l) and KK genotype (54.6 ± 15.6 mg/dl, 1.4 mmol/l ± 0.4 mmol/l), especially in males. This was not proved by our previous study where only women were participated [6]. Additionally, Frikke-Schmidt et al.[14] did not find any association with HDL-C levels in Danish population. Kitjaroentham et al.[15] studied overweight/obese Thai subjects of both sexes. The overweight/obese men who had the K allele had lower HDL-C than controls. In our study, we do not find any association of the R219K variant with any parameter of the lipid profile. Also, the distribution of all studied ABCA1 gene polymorphisms was not different according to gender. Noteworthy to mention is that the R219K distribution bared borderline statistical significance (p = 0.08) between two studied groups. In general, blood lipid levels did not seem to vary according to ABCA1 gene polymorphisms, when testing all subjects or when testing only men or only women.R1587K polymorphism Clee et al.[9] in the study already mention above found that K carriers of R1587K (RK, KK) had lower HDL-C concentration compared with noncarriers in an allele dose-dependent trend. On multiple regression analysis including age, BMI, smoking, and TG as covariates, the R1587K genotype remained a significant predictor of HDL-C. Frikke-Schmidt et al. [16] associated the R1587K variant with a stepwise decrease in HDL-C in women in heterozygotes and homozygotes, and with a similar trend in men. Mantaring et al.[17] did not find any statistical significance between R1587K variant with the lipid profile. However, Tsai et al.[18] found that after fenofibrate treatment the KK genotype of R1587K was associated with significantly increased small HDL and with increased HDL particle concentrations. In our previous study [6] where only women were participated, the difference in TC, LDL-C and TGs concentration was detected between RK and RR genotypes. In this study we found according to gender that blood lipid levels did not seem to vary in genotypes of R1587K polymorphism. However, a significant difference of LDL-C distribution was detected in female population. We also expected to found a difference in TC and TGs values between genotypes of female population as in previous study [6]. However, in the current study, in order to expand the study population, we included women with different lipid profiles, affecting the overall variability and altering the final results. Generally, lipid profile can be influenced by several genetic and environmental factors such as smoking status, eating habits, associated customs (fasting periods), sedentary life style, body composition, gender and others. The most important factors influencing the lipid profile include the sex hormone status and age. Unfortunately, in our study apart from age, smoking status and BMI we have not gone to all other details which potentially could influenced the results (added data consisted of 1/6 of women’s study cohort).I883M polymorphism Tan et al.[19] studied the I883M variant in Malays and Chinese population. They found an association with lipoprotein(a) concentration in Malays population and with apolipoprotein B concentration in Chinese population. However, Clee et al.[9] did not find any difference according to lipid levels and genotypes in carriers of the I883M, although individuals with MM genotype had higher progression in minimum obstruction diameter and cardiac event rate compared with the II genotype individuals. Hodoğlugil et al.[20] correlated the I883M variant with higher HDL-C concentration in both sexes. Similarly, Jensen et al.[21] among younger women and Porchay-Baldérelli et al.[22] in population with type 2 diabetes mellitus found that the M allele of I883M was associated with higher HDL-C concentration. Additionally, Mantaring et al.[17] found some differences in allele frequency of I883M gene, which were also present between the highest and lowest HDL-C concentration groups (36% vs 20%; Ptrend = 0.05). On the contrary, Kitjaroentham et al.[15] did not find any difference in HDL-C concentrations among I883M genotype polymorphism. Although, this variant was common in Thai ethnic groups, there were no differences detected in genotype frequency between overweight/obese and control subjects groups. Similarly, Frikke-Schmidt et al.[14] found that I883M did not affect HDL-C levels but predicted higher risk of CAD. Also, Sandhofer et al.[23] found that I883M variant showed no effect on plasma lipids or carotid atherosclerosis. In our study, we have not found any association with the lipid profile. However, there are some data from Delgado-Lista et al.[24] suggesting that the major allele homozygotes for ABCA1 gene polymorphisms i27943 (rs2575875) and R219K (rs2230806) have a lower postprandial response as compared to minor allele carriers. The fact that in current study blood lipid levels did not seem to vary according to ABCA1 gene polymorphism could be influence, at least in part, because they were measured in the fasting state. A limitation of this study is the relatively small number of men’s group. However, the effort was put for sample to be homogenous, living in the similar conditions as it happened with our study population. Another limitation of this type of study is that, studies based on the candidate-gene approach, which have been demonstrated genotype-phenotype associations, are not always replicable. There are only few studies which compare the influence of ABCA1 gene polymorphisms on lipid profile in accordance to gender. The ABCA1 gene polymorphisms frequency, distribution and lipid profile did not differ according to gender. However, in the female population the KK genotype of R1587K gene indicated lower LDL-C levels.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors’ contributions VK participated in the development of hypothesis, drafting of the manuscript and carried out the genetic analysis, AM participated in the molecular genetic studies, AK performed the statistical analysis and drafting of the manuscript, GV and AK collected the blood samples, SM participated in the drafting and revising the manuscript, DD participated in revising the manuscript critically for important intellectual content, CM participated in the study design and its coordination and GK conceived the study and participated in the development of the hypothesis, the study design and drafting of the manuscript.

Introduction Carotenoids are essential components of the photosynthetic machinery and play a critical role in preventing photooxidative damage (Howitt and Pogson, 2006). Carotenoids are precursors of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) (McCarty, 1995). They are also precursors of vitamin A, and some carotenoids protect against human age-related macular degeneration (Beatty et al., 2004). A few carotenoids are used as colourants in the food and cosmetics industries and some are important supplements in fish feed formulations (Umeno et al., 2005). Carotenoids are derived from the isoprenoid pathway and are synthesized in almost all types of plant plastids (Howitt and Pogson, 2006). They co-accumulate with chlorophyll in pigment-binding protein complexes embedded in thylakoid membranes (Botella-Pavía and Rodríguez-Concepción, 2006). Generally, the amounts of β-carotene and lutein are proportional to the content of chlorophyll a and b, respectively (Pogson et al., 1996). Carotenoid-deficient mutants usually show impaired photosynthesis (reviewed by DellaPenna, 1999; Dong et al., 2007) Three independent plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signalling pathways have been described (Nott et al., 2006). The best-studied retrograde pathway is triggered by the accumulation of the chlorophyll precursor, Mg-Protoporphyrin IX (Mg-ProtoIX), in the tretrapyrrole pathway (Larkin et al., 2003; Strand et al., 2003). GUN4 (GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4) is a chloroplast-encoded Mg-ProtoIX-binding protein and can stimulate Mg-chelatase activity (Larkin et al., 2003). GUN1 encodes a chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein, and the three known chloroplast retrograde signal pathways intersect upstream of GUN1 (Koussevitzky et al., 2007). AtGLK1 and AtGLK2 (Golden 2-Like) are redundant members of the GARP superfamily of transcription factors (Fitter et al., 2002). AtGLK1 is downregulated by GUN1 when plastids are dysfunctional and has been reported as a positive regulator of photosynthesis-related nuclear gene expression in a plastid-to-nucleus signalling pathway (Kakizaki et al., 2009). ABI4 acts as a negative regulator of photosynthesis-related nuclear gene expression and part of the GUN4/GUN1 signalling pathway (Koussevitzky et al., 2007). Although carotenoid biosynthesis pathways in plants have been well documented (Howitt and Pogson, 2006), the mechanisms that regulate carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation in plants are less understood. A combination of factors are known to regulate carotenoid accumulation in plants. These include metabolic controls that determine the rate of anabolism and catabolism, availability of storage compartments, and transcriptional and epigenetic regulation (Hannoufa and Hossain, 2012). To gain insight into additional mechanisms, an activation tagged population of Arabidopsis thaliana was screened, and this led to the identification of a new T-DNA insertion mutant named cbd (carotenoid biosynthesis deficiency). The phenotype of the cbd mutant was shown to be due to a mutation in the chloroplast signal recognition particle 54kDa subunit gene (cpSRP54). The mutation reduced chlorophyll and carotenoid content, impaired chloroplast development, and caused an ABA deficiency in seedlings of cbd. These data showed that over-expression of cpSRP54 in Arabidopsis and Brassica napus raised carotenoid levels in seeds without affecting growth or seed yield and suggested that cpSRP54 can be used as a tool for biofortification of carotenoids in oilseed crops and other crop plants.Materials and methods Arabidopsis plant materials and identification of carotenoid-deficient mutants A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) T-DNA activation tagged SK mutant population was generated using the pSKI015 vector at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (Robinson et al., 2009; www.brassica.ca). The cpSRP54 mutants, CS850421 and SALK_079668 (Alonso et al., 2003), were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~plantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm). The mutants were analysed by PCR amplification using one primer specific to the T-DNA (LBb1, Table 1) and two primers specific to the flanking genomic DNA sequence (P1 and P2 for CS850421; P3 and P4 for SALK_079668). Homozygous Arabidopsis mutant seeds were used for further studies.Table 1.

(2005)UBCAt5g25760TGCTTGGAGTCCTGCTTGGATGTGCCATTGAATTGAACCCTCTCzechowski et al. (2005) SK mutants with defects in carotenoid accumulation were identified by sowing approximately 1000 seeds from each T2 super pool (37 pools, 100 lines per pool) on RediEarth soil (WR Grace, Ajax, Canada) and growing the lines in a controlled greenhouse environment (light intensity 230 µmol m–2 s–1; 16/8 light/dark; 20/17 °C). Arabidopsis seedlings with light green or pale yellowish leaves were selected as putative carotenoid mutants. For subsequent analysis, sterilized homozygous mutant seeds were incubated in 0.05% agarose at 4 °C for 2 days, then placed on Petri dishes containing 1/2 Murashige and Skoog basal medium (MS), 1% sucrose, and 0.8% agar and incubated in a growth cabinet at 60–80 µmol.m–2.s–1 under 16/8 light/dark at 22 °C. Seven-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were used for carotenoid analysis, semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and ABA quantification. For carotenoid analysis and qRT-PCR analysis of cpSRP54 gene expression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, 8-day-old seedlings grown under the same growth cabinet conditions as above were used.Molecular characterization of the Arabidopsis cbd mutant, cbd complementation lines, and wild-type over-expression lines Genomic DNA was isolated using the method of Michiels et al. (2003), and used for thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL)-PCR (Liu et al., 1995) and genome walking (BD GenomeWalker Universal Kit, BD Biosciences Clontech, Mississauga, ON, Canada) to identify T-DNA insertion sites in the mutant line. The results were confirmed by PCR with one T-DNA-specific primer, pSKTAIL-L1, and two primers, P5 and P6, specific to the flanking genomic DNA sequence (Table 1). For molecular complementation of mutant line cbd and development of cpSRP54 over-expression lines in a wild-type (WT) background, a 6.2-kb region of genomic DNA (gDNA) including the native promoter, 5′-untranscribed region (UTR), coding region, 3′-UTR, and 3′ flanking sequence of cpSRP54 (At5g03940), was amplified by PCR with primers P9 and P10 (Table 1), cloned into the pCR8/GW/TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada), and then subsequently subcloned into the binary vector pMDC99 (Curtis and Grossniklaus, 2003). Primers P7 and P8 (Table 1) were used to amplify the full-length cpSRP54 coding region (CDS), which was cloned in an identical cloning vector and subsequently subcloned into the binary vector pMDC83 (Curtis and Grossniklaus, 2003). Binary plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101pMP90, and A. thaliana transformation was conducted according to the floral dip procedure (Clough and Bent, 1998).RNA isolation, semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and qRT-PCR of Arabidopsis tissues Total RNA was isolated from mutant, WT, and complemented/over-expression transgenic Arabidopsis plants using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and used for RT-PCR analysis of cpSRP54 gene expression and co-amplification of the internal control gene, AtACT2 (AT3G18780) (primers listed in Table 1). cDNA synthesis was conducted using 1 µg of total RNA and SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was performed using an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4min, followed by 26 cycles at 94 °C for 25 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1min 45 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7min. The amplicon was confirmed by sequencing. For qRT-PCR, total RNA and cDNA preparations were made as described above. cDNA samples were diluted 10-fold and 2 µl diluted cDNA was used in each PCR reaction. qRT-PCR reactions were performed on three cDNA batches with a Bio-Rad CFX Manager System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada) using 12.5 µl of 2× SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Invitrogen) and gene-specific primers listed in Table 1. Amplifications of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme gene (UBC) and At5g12240 (Czechowski et al., 2005) were used as internal controls for normalization of expression levels. Amplification efficiency for internal controls and all target genes were 100%. Triplicate seedling samples were used and analysed statistically using ANOVA. B. napus transformation and plant growth conditions Arabidopsis cpSRP54 genomic sequence including 5′- and 3′-UTR was amplified by PCR using primers FFC-F31 and FFC-R34 (Table 2) with added BamHI and SalI sites, respectively, and TA-cloned into vector pCR2.1-TOPO for sequencing. Subsequently the cpSRP54 fragment was subcloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of the modified binary vector pBI121 in which the CaMV 35S promoter was replaced with the seed-specific B. napus napin promoter (Rask et al., 1998) at the BamHI and HindIII sites. Cotyledons with cotyledonary petioles from 5-day-old seedlings of B. napus doubled haploid line DH12075 were used as explants for transformation with A. tumefaciens GV3101 pMP90 harbouring the cpSRP54 + construct. One ml of the overnight A. tumfaciens culture was added to liquid MS media containing 1mg l–1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 0.5g l–1 MES, 1% DMSO, and 0.04g l–1 acetosyringone buffered at a pH 5.6. B. napus explants were floated in this A. tumfaciens suspension for 2 hours after which the explants were removed, placed on filter paper moistened with MS media, incubated in the dark at 15 °C for 5 days, and transferred to selection media containing 0.7% Phytablend agar (Caisson Laboratories, North Logan, UT, USA), 3% sucrose, 4.5mg l–1 benzylaminopurine, 450mg l–1 timentin, and 20mg l–1 kanamycin. After 4–6 weeks, regenerated green shoots were transferred every 2 weeks to shoot selection media with BA at 0.5mg l–1 until normalized, then placed in 100ml rooting jars containing MS medium with 3% sucrose, 0.1mg l–1 NAA, 0.7% Phytablend agar, 450mg l–1 timentin, and buffered to pH 5.8. Rooted shoots were transferred to pots in a controlled environment greenhouse 16/8 light/dark at 20/17 °C. Only those plants with a confirmed transgene as determined by PCR using napin-F5 and FFC-R6 primers (Table 2) were subjected to further analysis.Table 2.

(2004) with some modifications. Briefly, the seeds were ground into fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Approximately 50mg seeds were used for RNA extraction with 700 µl of extraction buffer. After extraction with chloroform/isoamylalcohol (CIA, 24:1) and a mixture of water-saturated phenol containing 35% (w/v) guanidium thiocyanate and 1/10 (v/v) 2M sodium acetate (pH 4.0), the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and a half volume of 100% ethanol was added to precipitate RNA. Subsequent procedures were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR reactions were conducted as described for Arabidopsis tissue except that 1 µl of 10-fold diluted cDNA was used in each PCR reaction. Amplification of B. napus BnACT3 was used as an internal control for the normalization of expression levels. For each independent transgenic line, triplicate seed samples were tested for expression and analysed statistically using ANOVA.Extraction and analysis of carotenoids from seeds and seedlings A. thaliana and B. napus seeds were harvested immediately upon maturation of soil-grown plants and stored at –20 °C. Approximately, 150mg seeds or 50mg agar-grown seedlings was used for carotenoid analysis. Seed carotenoid extraction and HPLC analysis were conducted as described previously (Yu et al., 2007). For carotenoid analysis of seedlings, saponification was conducted at room temperature for 30min. Procedures of extraction and HPLC analysis following saponification were the same for seedlings and seeds. Triplicate samples were used for carotenoid analysis and analysed statistically using ANOVA.Chlorophyll extraction and quantification in Arabidopsis Seven-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings (20–40mg freshweight) were ground into fine powder with liquid nitrogen. The sample powder was suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 80% acetone and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10min at 4 °C. The chlorophyll content of the supernatant was measured at 647nm and 664nm, and calculated using the formula described by Inskeep and Bloom (1985).Detection of cell death and histochemical detection of O2 – in Arabidopsis Arabidopsis WT and mutant seeds were sterilized and grown on Petri dishes under 16/8 light/dark at 22 °C (standard condition, SD) for 10 days. Subsequently, one group of WT and mutant plants were maintained under the same conditions for another 10 days, while another group was transferred to continuous white light (WL) at room temperature to grow for another 10 days. The fifth and sixth leaves were harvested and used for detection of cell death and histochemical detection of O2 – at the end of these treatments. Cell death was examined by Evan’s Blue staining as described in Dong et al. (2007). O2 – accumulation in leaves was detected according to Fitzgerald et al. (2004).Transmission electron microscopy of Arabidopsis chloroplasts The first true leaf (yellow in cbd) from 10-day-old seedlings (at least 10 seedlings for each) was grown on 1/2 MS + 1% sucrose agar, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and embedded with resin Eponate 12 after serial dehydration with ethanol to observe chloroplast structure. Ultrathin sections were floated onto 200-mesh copper grids (Ted Pella, Redding, CA, USA) which had been coated with Formvar. Grids were stained for approximately 30 minutes with a 2% solution of uranyl acetate, and then rinsed with distilled water before staining for 10 minutes in Reynolds lead citrate (Reynolds, 1963). Grids were left to dry at least 24 hours before observation in a Philips CM 10 transmission electron microscope (TEM).ABA quantification To quantify the ABA content of cbd, CA850421, SALK_079668, and WT plants, approximately 20mg of respective 7-day-old seedlings was extracted with 80% methanol as described by Galpaz et al. (2008). ABA was quantified by enzyme immunoassay using a Phytodetek ABA test kit (Agdia, Elkhart, IN, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Triplicate samples were used and analysed statistically using ANOVA.ResultsIdentification of the cbd mutant The cbd mutant was identified from the SK A. thaliana T-DNA activation tagged mutant population (Robinson et al., 2009). Seven-day-old seedlings of the cbd mutant had yellow cotyledons (Fig. 1A), which became greener with time. All newly emerged true leaves were yellow and became increasingly green as they matured, but not to the same extent as WT leaves(Fig. 1A, 1B). Stems, inflorescences, flower bud sepals, and siliques were also pale yellow, and all of these organs became light green later in development. Mature cbd mutant plants grew slower and were smaller than WT (Fig. 1C). Total chlorophyll was reduced by more than 50% in the 7-day-old seedling of cbd, with both chlorophyll a and b significantly decreased (Fig. 2A). Seedlings of the mutant had approximately 40% of total carotenoid compared to WT. All individual carotenoid compounds were reduced in cbd seedlings except for the minor carotenoid, zeaxanthin, which was not affected (Fig. 2B).The total and individual carotenoid contents of cbd mature seeds were also lower than that of WT seeds, with the exception of zeaxanthin, which was somewhat higher in the mutant (Fig. 2C). To examine if the phenotype in the cbd mutant was caused by a single gene mutation, the mutant line was backcrossed to WT. All F1 progeny (n = 27) had a WT appearance. The segregation ratio of F2 progeny phenotypes (302:107, WT/mutant) indicated that the cbd phenotype is due to a single recessive mutation.Fig. 1. Phenotypes of cbd, SC850421 and SALK_079668 mutants.

(H) Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of cpSRP54 in mutant lines and WT.Cell death and superoxide accumulation in cbd leaves Evan’s Blue stain was used to investigate the extent of cell death in young yellow leaves of the cbd mutant. Under both SD and WL conditions, large blue-green patches of dead cells were observed in cbd leaves (Fig. 2D). More severe cell death occurred under WL in cbd, while little obvious staining was found in WT. The accumulation of superoxide (O2 –), a major species of ROS, was detected by staining the young leaves with nitroblue tetrazolium and observing the purple-blue precipitate. Under SD, superoxide was not detected in WT but it could be easily seen in cbd (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, cbd accumulated abundant superoxide under WL.Defective chloroplast development in the cbd mutant Reduced chlorophyll and carotenoid levels and yellow phenotypes in true leaves of the cbd mutant suggested possible defects in chloroplast development. To analyse the effect of the cpSRP54 mutation on chloroplast development, the chloroplast ultra-structure of the first true leaf from 10 individual 10-day-old seedlings of WT and cbd was examined by TEM. Chloroplasts were well developed and organized in the WT mesophyll cells. However, the chloroplasts of cbd had reduced grana stacking with fewer linkages between grana (Fig 2F).Molecular and genetic characterization of the cbd mutant TAIL-PCR revealed that a single T-DNA was inserted into the 11th exon of the At5g03940 locus (Fig. 2G). This encodes the 54kDa subunit of the chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP54), also referred to as Fifty Four Chloroplast homologue (FFC). Two mutants, two allelic salk line mutants, SALK_079668 (Alonso et al., 2003) and CS850421, showed morphological phenotypes similar to those of cbd, although not as extreme (Fig. 1). In addition, SALK_079668 and CS850421 had similar chlorophyll and carotenoid patterns in both 7-day-old seedlings and carotenoid patterns in mature seeds (Fig. 2B, 2C), although SALK_079668 was not as affected as CS850421 and cbd.Gene expression profile in mutants Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was conducted to analyse cpSRP54 gene expression in cbd mutant and two allelic salk line mutants. SALK_079668 had one T-DNA insertion in the promoter region (–326bp) and CS850421 had one T-DNA in the 7th exon of the At5g03940 locus (Fig. 2G). To show that these two recessive mutants were allelic to cbd, reciprocal crosses between these mutants and cbd were conducted. All the F1 progeny (n = 156 for cbd {female} × CS850421 {male}; n = 123 for CS850421{female} × cbd {male}; n = 47 for cbd {female} × SALK_079668 {male}; n = 14 for SALK_079668 {female} × cbd {male}) showed the same phenotype as cbd. These genetic data confirmed the recessive nature of cbd and that CS850421 and SALK_079668 were allelic to it. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was conducted to examine expression of cpSRP54 gene in 7-day-old seedlings of the three mutant plants. Analysis showed that the transcript of the full-length cpSRP54 coding region (CDS) was undetectable in cbd and CS850421 mutants, while SALK_079668 had a much lower level of full-length cpSRP54 transcript compared to WT (Fig. 2H). This is consistent with the observed total carotenoid level for SALK_079668, which although reduced in comparison to WT, was higher than in cbd and CS850421 (Fig. 2B, 2C). A molecular complementation experiment was conducted to confirm whether the cbd phenotype was caused by a mutation in cpSRP54. Constructs containing cpSRP54 gDNA and CDS were introduced individually into cbd. T2 transgenic plants resulting from both cbd complementation strategies (20 lines per construct) showed restoration of the WT growth and colour phenotype (Fig. 3A). WT levels of carotenoids were shown in seedlings of cbd complementation lines constructed with CDS, but levels were 15% higher in complementation lines constructed with the gDNA relative to WT (Fig. 3B). This carotenoid pattern resulted from cpSRP54 transcript levels (qRT-PCR analysis) which were only slightly higher than WT in cbd plants transformed with the cpSRP54 gDNA, but much stronger in mutant plants transformed with cpSRP54 CDS (potentially due to the strong constitutive promoter, CaMV35S) (Fig. 3C). Both constructs were also used to overexpress cpSRP54 in WT background. Visible phenotype differences were not observed in these over-expression transgenic lines (20 lines per construct) (data not shown). However, the total carotenoid level (lutein and β-carotene) of 8-day-old seedlings transformed with cpSRP54 gDNA was 15% higher than in WT or over-expression lines transformed with CDS, even though transcript levels of the two constructs were relatively similar in this background (Fig. 3B, 3C). Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that disruption of cpSRP54 was the cause of the altered leaf and cotyledon colour and altered carotenoid profile in the cbd mutant.Fig. 3. Complementation of cbd and over-expression of Arabidopsis cpSRP54 in WT Arabidopsis. (A) Representative phenotypes of Arabidopsis cbd lines complemented with an Arabidopsis cpSRP54 gDNA or CDS. Three-week-old seedlings are shown.

Significant difference was set at P ≤ 0.05 (*) and P ≤ 0.01 (**) relative to WT Arabidopsis. (C) Semi-quantitative RT-PCR confirmation of cpSRP54 expression in cbd-complemented and over-expression transgenic lines as indicated. The CDS of cpSRP54 was amplified and the AtACT2 gene was used as an internal control. NT, non-transformed control.Impact of cpSRP54 expression changes on the transcription of carotenoid and photosynthesis-related genes Given the reduced levels of carotenoids and chlorophylls in seedlings of the cbd mutant, qRT-PCR was carried out on 7-day-old seedlings of cbd and WT to examine whether the cpSRP54 mutation had an impact on the expression of carotenoid and chlorophyll biosynthetic genes. Expression of lycopene β-cyclase (bLYC), and especially β-carotene hydroxylase 2 (BCH2) and zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), was significantly decreased in cbd compared to WT (Fig. 4A). Phytoene synthase (PSY), the key enzyme in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, and other biosynthetic enzymes did not show transcript differences between cbd and WT; neither did PSY protein levels show changes (Supplementary Fig. S1, available at JXB online). In contrast, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCD) were oppositely affected such that higher transcript levels were observed for CCD1, CCD4, and CCD7 in cbd seedlings (Fig 4A). Transcripts of both protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase a and b (PORA and PORB) and the chloroplast-encoded large subunit of Rubisco (LSU) were significantly decreased in the leaves of cbd mutant (Fig. 4B). In contrast, transcription of CAO (chlorophyllide a oxygenase), which converts chlorophyllide a to chlorophyllide b, was not significantly affected in the mutant (Fig. 4B), even though chlorophyll b content was decreased. Expression of light-harvesting antenna protein genes for photosystems (PS) I and II (Lhca and Lhcb, respectively), proteins that utilize other thylakoid targeting pathways such as PSBS (spontaneous pathway), OE33 (Sec pathway) and the chloroplast-encoded gene PSBA (D1), which requires cpSRP54 to translocate to its thylakoid location (Amin et al., 1999), were also not affected.Fig. 4.

Values are mean ± standard error of three replicates. Significant difference was set atP ≤ 0.05 (*) and P ≤ 0.01 (**) relative to WT Arabidopsis (A, B, E, F) and green sections of cbd (C, D). Gene expression was examined in more detail in green sections relative to yellow sections in cbd mutant leaves (the third and fourth rosette leaf from nine 30-day-old plants). Expression of the BCH2 and CCD4 genes was significantly lower in yellow sections relative to green ones (Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, the expression of PDS and LUT1 genes was significantly higher in the yellow sections and there was a trend towards higher ZDS expression. The chlorophyll biosynthetic genes, CAO and PORA, and light-harvesting gene Lhcb2.1 also had significantly lower expression in yellow sections (Fig. 4D), even though the pattern in whole seedlings (containing a mixture of green and yellow tissue) was less extreme (Fig. 4B). Finally, expression of genes related to carotenoids and chlorophylls in Arabidopsis plants overexpressing cpSRP54 was analysed. bLYC and CCD4 had higher expression in the cpSRP54 CDS and gDNA over-expression lines relative to WT (Fig. 4E), as did the chlorophyll biosynthetic gene CAO(Fig. 4F). In some cases, enhanced expression occurred only with gDNA over-expression, e.g. transcripts of PSY, BCH2, and CCD8 were higher only in the cpSRP54 gDNA lines (Fig. 4E). Oddly, CCD8 was reduced in the CDS lines. Higher Lhcb1 and PORB and lower Lhcb2.1 transcripts accumulated in the gDNA over-expression lines (Fig. 4E, 4F) compared to WT. Moreover, transcripts encoding chloroplast proteins utilizing the non-SRP thylakoid targeting pathways, e.g. PSBS and OE33, were significantly higher in the over-expression lines transformed with the gDNA relative to WT and relative to lines overexpressing the cpSRP54 CDS (Fig. 4F).Plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signalling may regulate nuclear gene expression in cbd The downregulation of chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthetic genes in the cbd mutant could be an indirect response to defects in chloroplast development and suggested the potential involvement of a plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signalling mechanism. qRT-PCR showed that the expression of GUN4, but not GUN1, was approximately 30% lower in the yellow sections of cbd than in green sections (Fig. 5). This result suggested that Mg-ProtoIX synthesis could be reduced in the cbd yellow sections. Therefore, it seemed unlikely that downregulation of chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthetic genes in the cbd yellow sections resulted from the build-up of Mg-ProtoIX. However, AtGLK1 and AtGLK2, transcripts coding for functionally redundant proteins that positively regulate photosynthesis-related nuclear gene expression (PRNGE) in plastid-to-nuclear signalling (Fitter et al., 2002), were decreased 2-fold in yellow sections relative to green sections of the cbd mutant (Fig. 5). Coincidently, the expression of ABI4, which acts as a negative regulator of PRNGE and is part of the GUN1/GUN4 pathway (Koussevitzky et al., 2007), was not changed in yellow leaf sections compared to green sections of the cbd mutant (Fig. 5).Fig. 5. Expression patterns of genes involved in the plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signalling in yellow and green sections of the cbd mutant. Significant difference was set at P ≤ 0.05 (*) and P ≤ 0.01 (**) relative to green sections of cbd mutant.ABA biosynthesis is altered in the cbd mutant Since carotenoids are precursors of ABA and an increase in CCD transcripts and a reduction of carotenoids in cbd were observed, changes to levels of ABA were anticipated. To test this hypothesis, the ABA content of 7-day-old seedlings of the mutants and WT were measured. The results showed that cbd and the two allelic lines CS850421 and SALK_079668 had 2–3-fold lower ABA levels (Fig. 6A). To investigate whether the cbd mutant has an altered response to ABA, the effect of exogenous ABA on root growth was tested. cbd, the two allelic mutant lines, and WT plants had similar growth kinetics when treated with ABA (data not shown), suggesting that these mutants have a normal response to ABA. Since ABA level was reduced in cbd, the expression of genes involved in ABA metabolism was examined by qRT-PCR. Nine-cis-expoxycarotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs), the first family of enzymes committed specifically to ABA synthesis, cleave the epoxycarotenoid precursor to form xanthoxin (Nambara and Marion-Poll, 2005). The transcript levels of three of these genes, NCED3, NCED6, and NCED9, were upregulated in cbd (Fig. 6B), whereas those of NCED5, ABA2 (short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase), and AAO3 (abscisic aldehyde oxidase, catalysing the final step in ABA biosynthesis) were not significantly affected in cbd (Fig. 6B). Hence altered ABA biosynthesis was not the cause of the lower ABA level in cbd. The major catabolic route leading to 8'-hydroxy ABA is catalysed by the cytochrome P450 enzyme, ABA 8'-hydroxylase, encoded by members of the CYP707A family, CYP707A1–CYP707A4 (Kushiro et al., 2004). The expression of CYP707A1 and CYP707A2 was significantly increased in the cbd mutant (Fig. 6B), which was consistent with the decreased ABA content.Fig. 6. ABA content and expression of ABA metabolic genes in the cbd mutant and WT. (A) ABA content in 7-day-old seedlings. (B) Expression patterns of ABA biosynthetic and catabolic genes in 7-day-old seedlings. Significant difference was set at P ≤ 0.05 (*) and P ≤ 0.01 (**) relative to WT Arabidopsis. Expression of Arabidopsis cpSRP54 resulted in higher carotenoid accumulation in B. napus seeds Since over-expression of cpSRP54 elevated carotenoids in Arabidopsis seedlings, a decision was made to determine if cpSRP54 could be used to enhance the carotenoid levels in seeds of the oilseed crop, B. napus. T1 cpSRP54 + developing seeds in a DH12075 background showed varied transcript abundance for cpSRP54 at 34 DPA (Fig. 7A). Growth was not affected in these transgenic B. napus lines; neither was the seed yield changed at all (Supplementary Fig. S2). A range of T0 and T1 transgenic seeds accumulated substantially greater levels of the major B. napus seed carotenoids, lutein and β-carotene, ranging 1.3–10.9-fold higher compared with levels observed in WT DH12075 and empty vector control plants (Fig. 7B for seed from T1 lines; Supplementary Fig. S3 for T0 parental plants). Violaxanthin and zeaxanthin were at trace levels in T1 lines. The T0 plant BY1179 accumulated the highest amount of lutein (9-fold higher than control plants), and 41-fold higher β-carotene occurred in T0 plants BY1179 and BY1198 (Supplementary Fig. S3). Six independent events (plants) with significantly higher total carotenoid, along with one empty vector control line and a WT DH12075 control line, were selected for further analysis. T1 seeds derived from plant BY1171 had the highest amount of lutein (5-fold higher) and β-carotene (10-fold higher) compared with control seed, while levels in T1 plants derived from BY1179 were only 2-fold higher (Fig. 7B). Except for T1 lines derived from BY1208 (BY1251–BY1254), seeds of all other T1 lines had significantly higher (or a trend towards higher) β-carotene and/or lutein. However, transcript levels of cpSRP54 did not correlate well with carotenoid content in the transgenic B. napus seeds.Fig. 7. B. napus expressing the Arabidopsis cpSRP54 gene. (A) Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of cpSRP54 transgene expression in T1 developing seeds at 34 days post anthesis (DPA). (B) Carotenoid profiles of B. napus seeds from cpSRP54 + expression lines (T1), an empty vector control plant, and WT DH12075. [Violaxanthin and zeaxanthin were at trace levels.] (C) Carotenoid gene expression profiles in T1 transgenic cpSRP54 + B. napus developing seeds at 34 DPA. Values are mean ± standard error of three replicates. Significant difference was set at P ≤ 0.05 (*) and P ≤ 0.01 (**) relative to DH12075. Next, a wide range of carotenoid biosynthetic genes in developing seeds of T1 lines were tested at 34 DPA for transcript levels in the cpSRP54 + transgenic B. napus. Gene expression for many of these genes was enhanced relative to control (Fig. 7C) and was consistent with carotenoid content, except for line BY1234. Expression of carotenoid biosynthetic genes was especially enhanced in T1 line BY1236, which is consistent with its highest carotenoid content. However, the transcript level of carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO) was not significantly changed in any lines tested. To investigate whether altered carotenoid profiles affected fatty acid biosynthesis in the seeds of transgenic lines, oil content and fatty acid (FA) profiles were measured in T0 and T1 seeds (Supplementary Table S1). Of the 22 T0 independent transgenic plants tested, the majority (14 lines) had FA profiles and oil content identical to DH12075 control seed. Only eight had modified FA profiles and lower oil content, ranging from 26.13% freshweight (FW) in BY1179 seeds to 39.33% in line BY1180. Five lines with reduced oil content were detected in the T1 generation as well, and the lines with reduced oil content included those with increased carotenoid levels. Increased unsaturated fatty acids C18:2 and C18:3 and decreased C18:1 were also shown in some lines over both generations compared to DH12075 and empty vector control plants, for example T0 plants BY1170 and BY1202 and T1 lines BY1241 and BY1260. Overall, however, the magnitude of these changes to fatty acids was small or non-existent.Discussion In addition to their many benefits to human health and nutrition, carotenoids are essential components of the plant light-harvesting system and play significant roles in plant biology. These roles include photosynthesis, protection against photooxidative damage, and membrane stabilization (Botella-Pavía and Rodríguez-Concepción, 2006). Therefore, a major deficiency in carotenoid biosynthesis or accumulation, such as occurred with the current Arabidopsis cbd mutant, would be expected to affect plant development and chloroplast assembly. Dong et al. (2007) reported that A. thaliana carotenoid deficient mutants spc1-1 (spontaneous cell death1-1) and spc1-2, which have mutations in the gene encoding a putative ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS), had bleached leaves, excessive production of superoxide radicals, abnormal chloroplast development, and arrest of growth leading to seedling lethality. The current cbd mutant, with mutation in cpSRP54, manifested several similar phenotypes similar to those of spc mutants: reduced carotenoid and chlorophyll content in the seedlings, yellow cotyledons and first true leaves, as well as reduced growth. Molecular complementation of cbd, using both genomic and cDNA sequences, confirmed that the phenotypic changes were due to the mutational disruption of cpSRP54. Over-expression of a genomic copy of cpSRP54 in WT Arabidopsis led to an increase in total carotenoid content without visible morphological or developmental effects. However, lines transformed with the cpSRP54 CDS, in spite of much higher levels of cpSRP54 transcript than WT, did not show a significantly altered total carotenoid content. This suggests that more complex regulatory mechanisms may impact cpSRP54 expression, such as post-transcriptional gene silencing (Stam et al., 1997) or RNA splicing, which could result in altered and non-functional enzymes or post-translational modification. A similar finding was reported for the N plant resistance gene where transgenic plants expressing the N cDNA failed to exhibit complete resistance to tobacco mosaic virus, whereas transgenic plants harbouring a cDNA bearing an intron and containing 3'-N genomic sequences were resistant (Dinesh-Kumar and Baker, 2000). This indicates that for some genes, expression of genomic sequences may be preferable to cDNA to achieve complete protein functionality. Carotenoids are essential for quenching excessive free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and providing protection against photooxidation (Botella-Pavía and Rodríguez-Concepción, 2006). Plants with reduced carotenoids are known to generate photooxidative species such as ROS (Dong et al., 2007). Due to the substantial reduction of carotenoids in the Arabidopsis cbd mutant, an enhancement of superoxide could be detected in this mutant. This and potentially other ROS molecules could be the reason for the slow growth, small stature, and leaf cell death phenotype in this mutant. The carotenoid deficiency mutant spc1, encoding a ZDS essential for carotenoid biosynthesis, also showed defects in chloroplast development (Dong et al., 2007). The cbd chloroplast had reduced grana thylakoids, indicating the importance of cpSRP54 for plastid development and plant growth. This is consistent with a study on over-expression of dominant negative forms of cpSRP54, in which the alteration of a single amino acid in Arabidopsis resulted in delayed chloroplast development in the first true leaf with fewer thylakoid membranes and grana stacks than in control counterparts (Pilgrim et al., 1998). The cbd mutant showed reduced amounts of total carotenoids with very few changes in the transcription of genes encoding carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes. Although BCH2 expression was decreased in cbd, its related minor carotenoid, zeaxanthin, showed no substantial change in level. This inconsistency could be due to redundant function of BCH1 and/or lower expression of ZEP. The cbd mutant and allelic SALK lines also had similar levels of PSY protein relative to WT. This suggests that mutation of cpSRP54 did not substantially affect the expression or translation of carotenoid biosynthetic genes. Nevertheless, the expression of several CCD, NCEDs and ABA-related CYP450 genes were enhanced in cbd. The CCD1 enzyme cleaves a variety of carotenoid substrates at the C9–10 and C9'-10' double bonds (Schwartz et al., 2001). CCD4 can participate in dark-induced breakdown of carotenoids (Ytterberg et al., 2006) and CCD7 coordinately synthesizes strigolactones with CCD8 (Vogel et al., 2010). This upregulation of the CCD and NCED genes could lead to increased catabolism of carotenoids and hence to reduced carotenoids in cbd. Strangely, expression of NCEDs, encoding enzymes committed specifically to ABA synthesis, was upregulated in cbd (Fig. 6B). However, the increase in expression of ABA catabolic genes, CYP707A family members, is consistent with the decreased ABA content found in the cbd mutant. A plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signalling mechanism has been reported to regulate the expression of photosynthetic genes in the nucleus, and Lhcb is perhaps most responsive to this signal (Strand et al., 2003). In the current study, there was evidence suggesting disruption of this chloroplast retrograde signalling in the cbd mutant by a decrease in transcripts of AtGLK1, AtGLK2, and the retrograde signalling gene, GUN4 in yellow sections of the cbd mutant. Reduced gene expression of Lhcb2.1 and PORA in yellow leaf sections and the lower expression of the chlorophyll biosynthetic genes PORA, PORB, and LSU in whole seedlings could be a response to this change in plastid-to-nucleus signalling pathway. The increase in expression of a few carotenoid biosynthetic genes and the decrease in expression of carotenoid degradation genes in yellow leaf sections of the cbd mutant suggest that the cbd mutant is attempting to increase the antioxidation capacity in the leaf. Thus AtGLK1 and AtGLK2 may be involved in fine-tuning carotenogenesis and degradation in response to the functional state of the plastid. However, this does not preclude the possibility that plastid retrograde signalling may be disrupted by enhanced levels of ROS resulting from reduced carotenoid accumulation (Foudree et al., 2010). The storage and sequestration of carotenoids within various plastid types is an important regulatory mechanism for carotenoid accumulation. Organelle biogenesis partly determines the size of the carotenoid storage compartment of plastids (Lopez et al., 2008; Cazzonelli and Pogson, 2010) and carotenoids co-accumulate with chlorophyll in a pigment-binding protein complex embedded in thylakoid membranes in leaf tissues (Botella-Pavía and Rodríguez-Concepción, 2006). Both hp-2 and hp-3 mutants had enlarged plastid compartment sizes, which were coupled with enhanced levels of carotenoid (Kolotilin et al., 2007; Galpaz et al., 2008). It also has been reported that the carotenogenic pathway is appreciably stimulated in the presence of sequestering structures (Rabbani et al., 1998). Consequently, the defects of chloroplast development in cbd and, hence, the reduced storage compartment size for carotenoid accumulation in this mutant, could contribute to the decreased carotenoid content in cbd. Impaired chloroplast targeting could also feedback via the plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signalling to reduce chlorophyll and carotenoid content in cbd seedlings. All true leaves of the cbd mutant were yellow during early stages of development but became greener as they matured, Moreover, cbd could survive in the homozygous state, suggesting that the mutation is not lethal and that alternate thylakoid protein targeting systems can compensate for the loss of the cpSRP pathway, depending on the developmental stage. This possibility is supported by the work of Tzvetkova-Chevolleau et al. (2007), who showed that cpSRP43 functions independently of cpSRP54/cpFtsY when targeting LHCPs to the thylakoid membrane. These observations are consistent with the idea that cpSRP54 is non-essential and that plants can compensate for its loss by employing alternate thylakoid targeting pathways. Suppression of cpSRP54 expression appears to unleash a cascade of molecular and physiological events with consequences on plant growth and development in the Arabidopsis cbd mutant. Disruption of the plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signalling and deformed plastids may be responsible in part for the reduced carotenoid content in this line. Reduced carotenoid content impacts the antioxidative capacity of the cell, thus allowing for the accumulation of ROS, which affects plant performance as manifested by reduced growth, stunted appearance, and enhanced cell death. On the other hand, over-expression of cpSRP54 in Arabidopsis and expression in B. napus enhances seed carotenoid content, with no significant impact on growth, seed oil, or seed yield. These experiments point to the Arabidopsis cpSRP54 gene as a new tool/mechanism for enhancing carotenoids and improving the nutritional value of crop plants. Increased carotenoid levels have also been enhanced in another important crop (potato tubers) by inducing the formation of chromoplasts containing carotenoid-sequestering structures using the Or transgene (Lopez et al., 2008).

In mammals, MCH is predominantly expressed in the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta (Bittencourt et al., 1992; Casatti et al. 2002), and is also found in peripheral organs and tissues, such as the pancreas (Tadayyon et al., 2002), clonic epithelial cells (Kokkotou et al., 2008) or adipocytes (Bradley et al., 2000, 2002). It plays a key role in energy homeostasis, e.g. the control of food intake, body weight and metabolism (Ito et al., 2003; Marsh et al., 2002). Furthermore, it is involved in diabetes, gut inflammation and adiposity (Bradley et al., 2000, 2002; Kokkotou et al., 2008; Tadayyon et al., 2002). The biological function of MCH is mediated by two G-protein coupled receptors, MCH receptor 1 and 2 (MCHR1 (Chambers et al. 1999; Lembo et al.; 1999; Saito et al., 1999; Shimomura et al., 1999) and MCHR2 (An et al., 2001; Hill et al., 2001; Sailer et al. 2001; Wang et al., 2001)). The widespread distribution of MCH and its receptors and the involvement in a variety of pathologies make the MCH system interesting as a new target to treat human disorders. Several MCHR1 antagonists were presented in the last decade; some of them have entered clinical trials for the treatment of obesity (Luthin, 2007),while some are in the discussion of becoming anti-diabetic drugs (Gattrell et al., 2012). However, to enable confidence in preclinical to clinical translation of central MCHR1 pharmacology, a suitable Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracer needs to be developed. Borowsky et al. (2002) presented the evaluation of a very potent MCHR1 antagonist, SNAP-7941 ((+)-methyl (4S)-3-{[(3-{4-[3-(acetylamino)phenyl]-1-piperidinyl}propyl)amino]carbonyl}-4-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-6-(methoxymethyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-5-pyrimidinecarboxylate hydrochloride, 1) as shown in Fig. 1. It is described to reduce food consumption and to decrease body weight in rats. The excellent binding affinity (Kd=0.18 nM) for the MCHR1 was one of the main reasons to choose this compound as target for radioactive labeling. Hence, our aims were1. the preparation and characterization of a suitable labeling precursor (4, Fig. 1);2. the establishment of a radiosynthetic procedure for the preparation of the carbon-11 labeled analog, [11C]SNAP-7941 (2, Fig. 1) and its optimization;3. up-scaling and set-up of a fully automated preparation of [11C]SNAP-7941, including purification and formulation;4. set-up of a suitable quality control.2Experimental2.1Materials All chemicals and solvents were obtained from commercial sources with analytical grade and used without further purification.

Elemental analyses were performed at the Microanalytical Laboratory of the University of Vienna. [11C]CO2 was produced at a GE PET trace cyclotron (General Electric Medical System, Uppsala, Sweden) via the 14N(p,α)11C nuclear reaction by irradiation of a gas target (Aluminum) filled with N2 (+1% O2) (Air Liquide, Vienna, Austria). Typical beam currents were 48–50 μA and the irradiation was stopped as soon as the desired activity level was reached (approx. 50–65 GBq [11C]CO2, calculated by cyclotron operating software; corresponding to 30–40 min irradiation time). Generally, 7–12 GBq [11C]CH3 and 7–14 GBq [11C]CH3OTf, respectively, were obtained.

After distillation, the crude product was purified using column chromatography yielding 3.81 g (74.8%) prop-2-en-1-yl 4-methoxy-3-oxobutanoate (6) as yellowish oil. To a mixture of 3.70 g (21.50 mmol) of 6,3,4-difluorobenzaldehyde (3.15 g, 22.17 mmol), and urea (1.94 g, 32.30 mmol) in THF (18.4 ml) Cu2O (310 mg, 2.17 mmol) and acetic acid (130 μl) were added at room temperature, followed by dropwise addition of boron trifluoride diethyletherate (3.4 mL, 3.89 g, 24.43 mmol). The slurry was refluxed for 8 h, cooled, poured on a mixture of ice (30 g) and NaHCO3 (6 g) and filtered through Celite. After extraction with CH2Cl2 the solvent was evaporated and the purification of the residue was performed using column chromatography yielding 6.65 g (91.5%) prop-2-en-1-yl 4-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-6-(methoxymethyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylate (7) as yellowish oil.

After 10 min the reaction was quenched with H2O (6.1 mL) and warmed to 0 °C. K2CO3 (10.68 g, 77.27 mmol) and 3-aminopropylbromide hydrobromide (12.69 g, 57.96 mmol) were added and stirred overnight at room temperature. After washing with a solution of NaHCO3, extraction with Et2O, and subsequent column chromatography, prop-2-en-1-yl 3-[(3-bromopropyl)carbamoyl]-4-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-6-(methoxymethyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylate (8) was obtained in good yield (8.50 g, 87.7%). 4.60 g (21.07 mmol) of N-[3-(piperidin-4-yl)phenyl]acetamide (9; prepared according to Schönberger (2006) in a 5-step-synthesis starting from N-Boc-piperidinone) was solved in acetonitrile and after addition of 8 (6.90 g, 13.74 mmol) and K2CO3 (21.08 g, 152.52 mmol) stirred under argon atmosphere for 37 h at 35 °C. After filtration and evaporation in vacuo of the solvent, the residue was washed twice with a solution of NaHCO3, extracted with ethyl acetate purified via column chromatography to obtain allyl-SNAP 3 (allyl-3-(3-(4-(3-acetamindoophenyl)piperidin-1-yl)propylcarbamoyl)-4-(3,4-difluorphenyl)-6-(methoxymethyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylic ester)(3.70 g, 42.1%) as a pale yellow solid. After dissolving 3 (2.44 g, 3.81 mmol) in THF, (PPh3)4Pd (530 mg, 0.46 mmol) and morpholine (3.98 g, 44.38 mmol) were added under an argon atmosphere. After 17 h THF was evaporated and the residue was purified using column chromatography. 660 mg of SNAP-acid 4 (3-(3-(4-(3-acetamidophenyl)piperidin-1-yl)propylcarbamoyl)-4-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-6-(methoxymethyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid) (28.9%) was obtained after purification as an amorphic pale yellow solid. All intermediates and products were analyzed spectroscopically via NMR, MS, and HRMS. For NMR analysis, the solvent signal was used as an internal standard which was related to TMS with δ=7.26 ppm (1H in CDCl3) and δ=77.0 ppm (13C in CDCl3). 6: 1H-NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 3.39 (s, 3H, OCH3), 3.51 (s, 2H, 2-CH2), 4.05 (s, 2H, 4-OCH2), 4.61 (d, J=5.7 Hz, 2H, Allyl-OCH2), 5.20-5.35 (m, 2H, Allyl-CH2), 5.79-5.98 (m, 1H, Allyl-CH) 13C-NMR (50 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 45.6 (2-CH2), 59.3 (OCH3), 65.9 (Allyl-OCH2), 77.3 (4-OCH2), 118.7 (Allyl-CH2), 131.4 (Allyl-CH), 166.6 (1-COO), 201.4 (3-CO) MS: m/z (%) 173 (1), 172 (1), 115 (47), 84 (6), 69 (14), 55 (11), 45 (1 0 0), 43 (8), 42 (7), 41 (24) HRMS: m/z calculated for C8H12O4: 172.0736.

Preparation of all intermediates took place in analogy to the route described in Section 2.3 and is shown in Scheme 1. Purification was performed using column chromatography. 4.51 g (77%) rac-SNAP-7941 was obtained after purification as a yellow oil. NMR analysis (1H and 13C) of the final compound was in full accordance with the literature (Schönberger, 2006).2.4Radiochemistry2.4.1Synthesis of [11C]SNAP-7941 A reaction scheme is presented in Scheme 2. Using the TRACERlab™ FX C Pro synthesis module, [11C]CH3I and [11C]CH3OTf, respectively, were bubbled through a solution of SNAP-acid (0.01–4mg/mL, 0.02–6.67 mmol) in 500 μL solvent containing TBAH (1 equivalent). Different solvents (DMF (only for reactions with [11C]CH3I), acetone, 2-butanone and acetonitrile (≤10 ppm H2O; only for reactions with [11C]CH3OTf) and different reaction temperatures (DMF: 100–140 °C; acetone: 50 °C; 2-butanone: 20–75 °C and acetonitrile: 0–75 °C) were tested. After 1–10 min reaction time, the reaction mixture was quenched with water and the radiochemical yield was determined using analytical radio-HPLC (mobile phase: (water/acetic acid 97.5/2.5 v/v; 2.5 g/L ammonium acetate; pH 3.5)/acetonitrile 70/30 v/v; flow: 1 mL/min). Chromatograms were registered using an UV-detector (254 nm) and a NaI radioactivity detector in series.2.4.2Purification of [11C]SNAP-7941 The crude reaction mixture was injected into the build-in HPLC system (mobile phase: (water/acetic acid 97.5/2.5 v/v; 2.5 g/L ammonium acetate; pH 3.5)/acetonitrile 75/25 v/v; flow: 8 mL/min, after 6.5 min: 10 mL/min). Chromatograms were registered using an UV-detector (254 nm) and a NaI radioactivity detector in series. The retention times were 2.8–3.6 min (k′=1.8–2.6) for SNAP-acid and 8.1–9.7 min (k′=7.1–8.7) for [11C]SNAP-7941. The [11C]SNAP-7941 fraction was cut and diluted with 100 mL water. The resulting solution was then pushed through a C18 SPE cartridge. After washing with 10 mL water the purified product was completely eluted with 1.5 mL of ethanol and 5 mL 0.9% saline solution. Formulation was done with a further 9 mL of physiological saline (0.9%), 1 mL of saline solution (3%) and 1 mL of phosphate buffer (125 nM). Hence, the final total volume was 17.5 mL.2.4.3Quality control of [11C]SNAP-7941 Chemical and radiochemical impurities were detected using an analytical radio-HPLC (for conditions see Radiosynthesis section). Retention times were 3.1–4.1 min (k′=0.6–1.1) for SNAP-acid and 5.3–7.9 min (k′=1.7–3.0) for [11C]SNAP-7941. The chemical identity of [11C]SNAP-7941 was determined by co-injection of the unlabeled reference compound, SNAP-7941. Residual solvents were analyzed by GC. Osmolality and pH were checked with dedicated equipment.3Results and discussion3.1Organic synthesis A synthetic route to the precursor compound SNAP-acid (4) (660 mg, 28.9%) could be established via deallylation of allyl-SNAP (3). The use of other protecting groups (i.e. t-butyl, trimethylsilyl and p-methoxybenzyl) could not provide the desired precursor. The reference standard rac-SNAP-7941 (1) could be synthesized in good yields (4.51 g, 77%) and purity for the evaluation of the radiosynthesis.3.2Radiochemistry The first preparation of [11C]SNAP-7941 followed by a fully-automated synthesis and purification was successful. Using [11C]CH3I as methylation agent, the radiochemical incorporation yield of [11C]SNAP-7941 was below 4% in all tested conditions (reaction solvent, reaction temperature, reaction time, precursor concentration.). Using [11C]CH3OTf as methylation agent, the radiochemical incorporation yield was still unsatisfactory low in acetone (< 2.5%). Reasonable yields could be achieved using 2-butanone (up to 45%) or acetonitrile (up to 50%) as reaction solvent. Acetonitrile evinced as the most suitable solvent regarding yield and avoidance of separation problems in preparative HPLC. The evaluation of the precursor concentration, reaction temperature and reaction time using [11C]CH3OTf as methylation agent in acetonitrile is shown in Fig. 2. Highest radiochemical incorporation yields could be obtained using 4 mg/mL (49.0±2.0%) and 2 mg/mL (48.7±0.5%). No significant difference in the radiochemical incorporation yield was found between these two precursor concentrations. Significantly (P<0.01) lower yields were obtained with≤1 mg/mL of precursor. The radiochemical incorporation yields (n≥2) of [11C]SNAP-7941 (75 °C, 5 min) ranged from 8.8±6.4% using 0.05 mg/mL of precursor up to 49.0±2.0% using 4 mg/mL of precursor. No radiochemical conversion was observed using precursor concentrations <0.05 mg/mL (Fig. 2a). A clear inverse trend was found between temperatures versus radiochemical incorporation yields. At 1 mg/mL precursor for 5 min the radiochemical incorporation decreases with higher temperature: 45.7±0.3% at 0 °C, 41.4±0.6% at 25 °C, 36.2±0.6% at 50 °C and 35.3±0.6% at 75 °C (Fig. 2b). This trend was not due to the production of more side-products at higher temperatures, but due to the better conversion of [11C]CH3OTf at lower temperatures. Regarding the reaction time (1 mg/mL precursor, 75 °C), the maximum radiochemical incorporation yield (41.1±1.0%) was achieved after 2 min (Fig. 2c). Although the maximum yield was achieved after 2 min reaction time, there was no significant difference within the tested conditions (1–10 min). Hence, the optimum reaction conditions were determined to be 2 min reaction time at ≤25 °C reaction temperature using 2 mg/mL precursor in 500 μL acetonitrile (Table 1). Purification using semi-preparative HPLC was straight forward using a monolithic reversed-phase column at moderate flow rates (8–10 mL/min). Sample chromatograms are shown in Fig. 3. Subsequent SPE purification resulted in a recovery of >95% of [11C]SNAP-7941. Until now, 15 complete high-scale radiosyntheses were performed (2 mg/mL precursor, 25 °C, 2 min). 2.9±1.6 GBq of formulated [11C]SNAP-7941 (17.5±3.6%, based on [11C]CH3OTf; 11.5±6.4% EOB) was produced within <40 min. Full quality control was completed within 9 min. Radiochemical purity always exceeded 99% as determined by radio-HPLC. No residual precursor mass was detected but 9.6±6.4 μg of 12C-SNAP-7941 was found in the final product solution. Specific activity was determined via HPLC and found to be 28.9±9.4 GBq/μmol at the end of synthesis (EOS). Sample chromatograms are shown in Fig. 4. Residual solvent analysis revealed <5 ppm acetonitrile and no other impurities except ethanol (8.5%). Osmolality was 291±14 mosmol/kg and pH was 7.5±0.2. Achieved yields are sufficient to allow for preclinical and potentially clinical investigations. Due to general problems with the production of [11C]CO2 during the time frame of the presented study, specific activity was relatively low (28.9±9.4 GBq/μmol). Higher specific activities of [11C]SNAP-7941 are expected for future syntheses. Thus, the presented work is the basis for future applications that will further elucidate the role of MCHR1 in obesity, diabetes and several other pathologies.4Conclusion [11C]SNAP-7941, the first PET-tracer for the MCHR1, was prepared in a reliable and feasible manner, starting from a suitable labeling precursor (SNAP-acid). The optimized reaction conditions evinced sufficient overall yields for subsequent preclinical and clinical investigations.

Ethnic differences in serum hs-CRP and 25(OH)D concentrations and CVD are known. Objectives: to investigate the ethnic differences in hs-CRP concentrations, to assess the influence of 25(OH)D on these ethnic differences and to examine the influence of 25(OH)D on association between hs-CRP and cardiovascular health indices. Subjects: 62 healthy adults [26 African Americans (AA), 26 European Americans (EA), and 10 Hispanic Americans (HA)], ages 18–55 years. Serum hs-CRP and 25(OH)D as well as pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx), and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) were measured. hs-CRP was inversely associated with 25(OH)D ( = −0.25, = 0.049), and hs-CRP was positively associated with PWV ( = 0.29, = 0.04). The association of hs-CRP with PWV attenuated after adjustment for 25(OH)D ( = 0.15). hs-CRP was higher in AA compared to EA ( = 0.05); this differences was reduced by 32% after adjusting for serum 25(OH)D. Conclusion: eventhough the inverse association between serum 25(OH)D and CRP does not infer causality, lower serum 25(OH)D may increase risk for inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. The lower 25(OH)D in AA may predispose to greater inflammation and associated vascular dysfunction.

Introduction Chronic inflammatory stress, endothelial dysfunction, and arterial stiffness are key underlying factors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [1, 2]. C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein synthesized primarily in the liver, is an established biomarker of inflammation, is known to alter endothelial function via increased nitric oxide production [3] and its serum levels are positively associated with the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [4–6]. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentration is also associated with pulse wave velocity (PWV), the gold standard for assessing arterial stiffness, suggesting that inflammation is linked to arterial stiffness [7–9]. There is evidence that African Americans (AA) and Hispanic Americans (HA) have a greater risk of complications from CVD compared with European Americans (EA) [10, 11]. However to date, results vary as to whether or not inflammation differs between AA and EA. Khera et al. found higher hs-CRP concentrations among AA men and women between ages 30–65 years as compared to EA [12], whereas we have previously shown no differences in hs-CRP concentrations between AA and EA premenopausal women [13]. Additionally, AA have been shown to have greater arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction compared to EA [14–16]. Endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness are early and integral components of atherosclerosis and are novel biomarkers of CVD [17, 18]. Given the current magnitude of ethnic health disparities, it is paramount to identify and recognize race and ethnicity-related differences in cardiovascular risk factors. Vitamin D is hypothesized to have anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective properties and can potentially regulate proinflammatory cytokines [19, 20]. Serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the indicator of vitamin D status, is associated with serum hs-CRP concentrations [21]. Several researchers have demonstrated a potential link between vitamin D status and noninvasive indices of arterial stiffness and brachial artery distensibility measured by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) [22–24]. As AA are likely to have vitamin D deficiency [25], ethnic differences in vitamin D status may partially account for the ethnic differences in inflammatory biomarkers and vascular function. Although studies have examined the associations between hs-CRP, vascular resistance, and endothelial function indices [26, 27], the influence of 25(OH)D status on these outcomes is yet to be determined. The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that observed higher CRP in AA is due in part to their lower circulating vitamin D. A secondary objective was to determine whether vitamin D status influenced the associations between hs-CRP and cardiovascular risk markers (heart rate, brachial artery blood pressure (BP), central aortic BP, MAP, aortic PP, pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx), and flow mediated dilatation (FMD)) in healthy nonobese adults.2. Materials and Methods Subjects were 62 adults, both sexes, age 18–55 years who were previously enrolled in 2 observational cohort studies: the VIVID study and the DIVA study (clinical trial registration numbers: NCT01041547, NCT01041365). The Institutional Review Board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) approved both studies, and written informed consent was obtained before entry to the study. Ethnicity (European American—EA, African American—AA, or Hispanic American—HA) was self-reported. Exclusion criteria were diabetes, hypertension, or other conditions known to influence insulin sensitivity or vascular function; antihypertensive, glucose-controlling, or lipid-lowering medications, or other medications known to modify vascular function; vitamin D supplementation, smoking; BMI > 322 kg/m2, or lactose intolerance. Testing was performed on 2 separate days in the same week. Blood samples, seated and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and anthropometrics were obtained in the UAB Clinical Research Unit of the Center of Clinical and Translation Science (CCTS) and the Department of Nutrition Sciences after a 12 hr fast. Body composition (fat and lean mass) was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (iDXA, GE-LUNAR Radiation Corp., Madison, WI). During a second morning visit after an 8 hr fast, radial pulse wave analysis (PWA), carotid-femoral PWV, and FMD testing were conducted by a single physician in the Diabetes Research Training Center (DRTC) Human Physiology Core Cardiodynamic Laboratory. Brachial artery distensibility (FMD) was measured by brachial ultrasound imaging with a 7.5 MHz linear-array probe (Philips HP Agilent Sonos 5500, Andover, MA) according to standard guidelines [28]. Radial PWA and carotid-femoral PWV were performed using SphygmoCor applanation tonometry system (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia) as previously described [29]. Radial PWA was performed for assessment of augmentation index (AIx), AIx adjusted to a heart rate of 75 beat/min (AIx75), central aortic systolic blood pressure (aSBP) and central aortic diastolic blood pressure (aDBP). All analyses were conducted in the Core Laboratory of the University of Alabama at Birmingham DRTC. hs-CRP was assayed with the Stanbio Sirrus using a turbidimetric procedure. Mean sensitivity is 0.50 mg/L and interassay CV is 8.9%. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were assayed with a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technique (Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA).2.1. Statistical Analyses Descriptive characteristics are reported as means (±SDs). The distributions of all variables were examined, and variables that deviated from a normal distribution were log10-transformed prior to statistical analyses. Between-race differences for each variable were determined using a one-way ANOVA. Bonferroni post hoc analyses were performed when statistically significant differences were observed. In order to further explore factors that contributed to observed differences between race, a univariate analysis was performed on variables that were statistically significant, using %fat, 25(OH)D, as covariates in the analyses. Hispanic subjects were not included in the race analysis due to their smaller number. To determine if subjects differed based on their vitamin D status, subjects were divided based on serum 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL and <20 ng/mL [30, 31]. Group differences according to serum 25(OH)D status for each variable were determined with 2-group t-tests. Pearson correlation analyses were used to investigate the relationships between hs-CRP, serum 25(OH)D, and vascular measures. Serum 25(OH)D and percent body fat were further examined as potential confounders in MLR analyses to investigate the relationships between hs-CRP and vascular outcomes. All analyses were performed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS, version 19.0, Chicago, IL).3. Results A total of 62 subjects (26 EA, 26 AA, 10 HA) were included. Hispanic subjects were not included in the ethnic-specific analysis due to their limited number. AA had lower 25(OH)D (P = 0.001) and higher BMI (P = 0.03), percent body fat (P = 0.02), AIx75 (P = 0.001), PWV (P = 0.002), and CRP (P = 0.05) compared to EA—see Table 1. When EA and AA subjects combined, hs-CRP was inversely associated with 25(OH)D (r = −0.25, P = 0.049)—see Figure 1. The association of hs-CRP with25(OH)D persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and percent body fat, but was attenuated after adjusting for race (P = 0.069)—see Figure 1. After adjustment for 25(OH)D, the ethnic difference in CRP was reduced by 32% (P = 0.13)—see Figure 2. In subanalysis, hs-CRP was inversely associated with 25(OH)D in EA (r = −0.54, P = 0.004), and this persisted even after adjustment of age, sex, and percent body fat (r = −0.58, P = 0.002). hs-CRP was not associated with vitamin D status in AA. Due to the small sample size, we could not conduct analyses within the HA group. Serum 25(OH)D was associated with PWV after adjusting for race (r = −0.303; P = 0.034). hs-CRP was positively associated with PWV (r = 0.29, P = 0.04) and heart rate (r = 0.295, P = 0.02), but not with brachial or aortic SBP/ DBP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), aortic pulse pressure (PP), AIx75, or FMD. The association of hs-CRP with PWV attenuated after adjustment for BMI (r = 0.24, P = 0.09) and disappeared after adjustment for 25(OH)D concentrations (r = 0.20, P = 0.15) and after adjustment for race (r = 0.261; P = 0.07). The association with heart rate persisted after adjustment for percent fat and 25(OH)D. When classified based on serum 25(OH)D concentrations (<20 ng/mL and >20 ng/mL), 27 subjects (43.5%) had serum 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL. Subjects with <20 ng/mL 25(OH)D had higher body weight (P = 0.002), BMI (P = 0.03), hs-CRP (P = 0.001), AIx75 (P = 0.001), and PWV (P = 0.015) as compared to individuals with serum 25(OH)D >20 ng/mL, when adjusting for age, race, %fat, and gender.4. Discussion In the present study, we have shown that hs-CRP is higher in AA, and this ethnic difference is attenuated by adjustment for vitamin D status. Moreover, hs-CRP is positively associated with PWV (a measure of arterial stiffness) and vitamin D may influence this association. These observations suggest that relatively low circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D may increase risk for inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, even in healthy young adults. Serum hs-CRP is an independent risk factor for development of hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and atherosclerosis [5, 32, 33]. We confirmed that AA have poorer vascular function indices, lower 25(OH)D concentrations, and higher hs-CRP, as shown in other studies [16, 34]. AA subjects also reportedly have a greater prevalence of coronary heart disease and mortality rates [35]. Although ethnic differences in vascular function are well known, the pathophysiological basis for these differences remains elusive. It is conceivable that vitamin D deficiency may trigger acute phase-reactant production, equivalent to a low-grade systemic inflammation. After adjustment for percent fat and serum 25(OH)D, the difference in hs-CRP between AA and EA was diminished, which may have relevant clinical implications and partially explain these ethnic differences. In our cohort, hs-CRP was associated with serum 25(OH)D which is consistent with previous reports [36]. Nevertheless, in our data, serum 25(OH)D was strongly associated with hs-CRP only in EA and the association persisted even after adjusting for BMI and percent fat. One explanation for the absence of an association of 25(OH)D and hs-CRP in AA could be masked by their almost ubiquitous vitamin D deficiency. As most of the AA subjects had a 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL, a large number of subjects may be required to detect an association. In our sample, the EA were predominantly responsible for the observed relationship between hs-CRP and 25(OH)D. With a larger sample size of AA subject, a possible association may manifest. A noteworthy observation by Amer and Qayyum [36] in a large cohort of asymptomatic adults shows that there was reduction in CRP for each 10 ng/mL increase in serum 25(OH)D as long as serum 25(OH)D was ≤ 21 ng/mL, and CRP started increasing with increasing 25(OH)D concentrations above > 21 ng/mL. They have not reported ethnic-specific cutoffs for this finding. Although the implications of these observations are not clear, there could be different threshold levels in AA and EA above which raising the 25(OH)D concentrations may not be helpful in improving the hs-CRP. In this study, we observed an association between CRP and PWV. It has been reported that PWV is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events [37]. We found that adjustment for serum 25(OH)D, attenuated the association between hs-CRP and PWV, suggesting that vitamin D status influences this relationship. Several reports have previously alluded to the fact that vitamin D can serve as an anti-inflammatory agent. Vitamin D3 supplementation was found to reduce the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α and enhance the anti-inflammatory interleukin 10, in a cohort of subjects with congestive heart failure. However, their CRP did not change [38]. Because of the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis and because elevated hs-CRP is reportedly associated with cardiovascular disease, it is critical to understand the factors responsible for elevated hs-CRP. Vitamin D supplementation may be an additive therapeutic option for conditions accompanied by increased inflammation and a subsequent decline in cardiovascular health. Limitations of the study are cross-sectional nature and relatively smaller sample size which limits our ability to conclude causality based on observational associations. Controlled clinical trials are required to clarify whether vitamin D supplementation reduces ethnicity differences in hs-CRP and whether vitamin D supplementation influences the associations between hs-CRP and vascular health indices. Strengths of the study are inclusion of subjects with body mass index <32 kg/m2, inclusion of DXA measure of body fat, and inclusion of young healthy adults—a population where preventive interventions could have a profound impact on health. Moreover, we were able to utilize direct accurate measures of arterial stiffness, endothelial function, and central BP parameters. We conclude that ethnic differences in hs-CRP may be mediated by unequal vitamin D status. Likewise, hs-CRP is higher in subjects with vitamin D deficiency. Furthermore, serum 25(OH)D influences the association between hs-CRP and PWV, a direct measure of arterial stiffness.

Introduction For over two decades functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to investigate human and animal brain function using a variety of experimental paradigms. The most popular functional imaging technique relies on the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast mechanism first reported in the anesthetized rat by Ogawa et al. (1990). Rodent fMRI studies have evolved from experiments focused on developing new MR imaging methods to recent work that employs the technique to investigate specific neurobiological mechanisms. A significant advantage of fMRI is that it allows a functional characterization of the awake rodent brain under different treatment and pharmacological conditions (Peeters et al., 2001; Sachdev et al., 2003; Febo et al., 2004b, 2005a,b; Ferris et al., 2005, 2006, 2008; Chin et al., 2006, 2011; Chen et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011). Rather than providing a direct window into neuronal activity, the BOLD fMRI signal depends on the brain’s blood supply and cellular oxidative metabolism. However, it supersedes previous in vitro techniques that were used to examine cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glucose utilization in the rat brain using injectable radiolabeled tracers because of its measurement of neural signals in real-time (Porrino et al., 1988; Stein and Fuller, 1992, 1993). Thanks to a growing number of studies on the nature of the BOLD signal, there is improved knowledge about the relationship between BOLD and neuronal activity (Fox and Raichle, 1986; Fox et al., 1988; Davis et al., 1998; Logothetis et al., 2001; Shmuel et al., 2002, 2006; Kennerley et al., 2005; Tian et al., 2011). The BOLD signal arises from changes in the oxy-to-deoxyhemoglobin ratio in tissue and thus is primarily a hemodynamic signal restricted by the biophysical properties of the local neurovasculature. This should be kept in mind when interpreting neuroimaging data. The use of in vivo single-unit, multi-unit, and local field potential (LFP) recordings and optical imaging methods to investigate changes in neural activity and vascular reactivity at sub-anatomical levels can strengthen the interpretability of fMRI data. We have performed fMRI of the neural actions of cocaine and the lactation stimulus in the unanesthetized maternal rat (Febo et al., 2004b, 2008). The present review will use these studies as methodological examples of fMRI in awake animals. Parallel preclinical and clinical imaging studies can provide a basis for direct translational research that could aid discoveries in different fields of neuropsychiatry. For instance, there have been significant human imaging studies that have investigated the neural actions of cocaine (Breiter et al., 1997; Gollub et al., 1998; Li et al., 2000), whereas there have been a separate series of imaging experiments on human maternal care (Bartels and Zeki, 2004; Nitschke et al., 2004; Strathearn et al., 2008). Collectively, these and other imaging studies have been in partial agreement with several animal studies on the brain regions that are involved in responding to cocaine or infant sensory cues. Animal studies have the design flexibility to verify results with a multiplicity of invasive brain methods that can inform human work and aid in data interpretations. Despite the advantages, there are also challenges to awake animal imaging that are different from those in anesthetized preparations. Several of these have been addressed in past studies (Lahti et al., 1998, 1999; Ludwig et al., 2004; King et al., 2005; Ferris et al., 2008). These include hardware issues (Lahti et al., 1998; Ludwig et al., 2004), animal stress (King et al., 2005), data processing and artifacts (Ferris et al., 2005, 2008). This review provides a summary of the methods used for functional MRI experiments in rats with a special focus on awake imaging methods that are used in our laboratory. This includes information on technical and conceptual aspects of fMRI in awake rats, starting with the physiological basis of the BOLD fMRI signal, describing the hardware and methods used to image awake as opposed to anesthetized rats and concluding with a detailed examination of data interpretations.Physiology of the BOLD Contrast MechanismThe BOLD signal The nuclear magnetic resonance mechanism that provides the basis for generating contrast in MR images depends on the behavior of hydrogen nuclei (protons) in water within the main tissue compartments of the brain. Unpaired protons contain a net positive charge and can act as tiny magnetic dipoles that align along the longitudinal axis (z-axis) of the external magnetic field (B0). Protons possess an angular moment (ω0), or precession, that is directly proportional to B0 and is described by the Larmor equation ω0 = γB0, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio (in the case of H1 42.6 MHz/T). Precession along the longitudinal z-axis is manipulated during typical MR experiments. Combinations of radiofrequency (RF) excitation pulses and switching of magnetic field gradients ultimately result in the recovery of tissue RF signals from different areas of the brain. RF pulses excite protons away from their steady state position imposed by the surrounding B0 field. Relaxation back to the steady state position is governed by two time constants termed T1 and T2. The time constants are associated with the intrinsic properties of specific tissue types (cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, gray matter) and thus allow the generation of contrast through the experimenter-mediated adjustment of echo times (TE) and repetition times (TR). The excitation and relaxation processes result in the emission of RF signals from tissue compartments of the brain. These are detected using coils that localize signals from the tissue of interest (in reality the MR signal is an “echo” of the original relaxation signal). The RF excitation and detection mechanism is accompanied by a series of slice selective, read-out and phase encoding gradient variations that allow the encoding of brain spatial information. A variant of T2, known as T2* (“T-2-star”), is produced by inhomogeneities in the magnetic field that cause reductions in T2 (faster transverse relaxation rate). Deoxyhemoglobin (dHb) in plasma red blood cells (RBCs) is paramagnetic while oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) is diamagnetic (Pauling and Coryell, 1936) and the intravascular difference between the two provides for an endogenous contrast mechanism (Ogawa et al., 1990). Ogawa et al. (1990) provided evidence that a decreased T2* signal in blood vessels, particularly veins of the rat cortex, is due to blood oxygenation state. Darker veins in the cortex were distinguishable in rats inhaling low O2 concentrations in inspired air (more dHb) while increased O2 saturation (significantly less dHb) increased the brightness of images. The T2* contrast was observed to be dependent on blood oxygenation. Therefore the BOLD signal arises from changes in the tissue concentrations of dHb. Seminal publications followed that provided support for task-dependent changes in the BOLD signal that occurs in T2* weighted images of the human somatosensory, motor and visual cortices (Bandettini et al., 1992; Ogawa et al., 1992).Relation between cerebral hemodynamics and neuronal activity Oxidative and non-oxidative metabolism supports neurons and glial cells (Kasischke et al., 2004). Elevations in arterial blood flow supply glucose and O2, which serve as fuel to generate the cellular energy substrates ATP and lactate. Most of the neuronal ATP expenditure is used to restore the equilibrium of the electrochemical potential for Na+, K+ and Ca2+ at synapses (Attwell and Iadecola, 2002). During conditions of high neuronal and metabolic activity, O2 diffuses down a steep concentration gradient from plasma RBCs across the capillary walls into the surrounding parenchymal tissue. This leads to dHb accumulation in the venous compartment. The paramagnetic effect of dHb is “felt” by local water protons in the intra and extravascular compartments, and this increases the relaxation rate of protons, decreasing the signal intensity in T2* weighted MR images. This is a transient effect, however, as the BOLD signal increases (increased T2*) within a few seconds of stimulus delivery. The supply of oxygenated blood is associated with increased delivery to metabolically active regions of the brain. Fractional increases in plasma HbO2 saturation from baseline levels therefore increase the T2* signal. Indeed, visual and somatosensory evoked changes in O2 metabolism was estimated to be 5% above baseline levels, but there is nearly a 30–50% increase in blood flow to the active cortical regions (Fox and Raichle, 1986; Fox et al., 1988). Therefore, increased CBF is several orders of magnitude above the O2 demand of the tissue. The over-compensatory mechanism is instrumental in generating the BOLD response observed in many studies. There have been thorough investigations of the possible neurovascular mechanisms contributing to the BOLD signal as well as the relation between the BOLD signal and neuronal activity. Knowledge from these studies contributes to the understanding of fMRI data. Stimulus-dependent increases in O2 consumption in the rat brain are associated with presynaptic action potential firing and ATPase-dependent movement of ions against their electrochemical gradients across the cell membrane (Attwell and Iadecola, 2002). Techniques to measure microscopic changes in tissue oxygenation and perfusion have been instrumental in understanding the underlying dynamics of the BOLD signal. Using intrinsic optical imaging and laser Doppler flowmetry, Malonek and Grinvald (1996) investigated the dynamics of the hemodynamic response in the cat visual cortex. It was shown that an increase in HbO2 and CBF response near single cortical columns occurs within several seconds (2–3 s) of visual stimulus presentation (Malonek and Grinvald, 1996; Malonek et al., 1997). At the single neuron level, it appears that there is an initial decrease in tissue O2 content due to a greater oxygen extraction fraction immediately after increasing firing activity (Thompson et al., 2003). This is followed by increases in O2 that may be due to the elevated CBF (Thompson et al., 2003). Simultaneous fMRI and neurophysiological recordings taken from the anesthetized rhesus macacque’s visual cortex demonstrated a near linear relation between BOLD and LFP, but this may not be the case for single-unit activity (Logothetis et al., 2001). The closer correspondence between BOLD and LFP’s may be helpful in understanding the “type” of neural processing and “computational level” contributing the most to fMRI results. Estimates of the primate cortex indicate that each 1 mm3 (which is about the size of a single volume element or “voxel” in human studies) contains approximately 50,000 neurons (Douglas et al., 2004). LFPs reflect larger scale electrical activity as a result of the cooperative interactions between populations of perhaps thousands of neurons rather than spike input or output at the single neuron level (Nadasdy et al., 1998). This is perhaps one of the most critical aspects of neural processing that should be carefully considered when interpreting BOLD data. To sum, the above data describe biological correlates of the mechanisms involved in generating the BOLD responses observed in fMRI studies. It appears, at the microscopic level (measured by intrinsic optical techniques), that there is evidence of a tight coupling between single neuron activity and oxygen metabolism that contributes to generating the BOLD signal, but larger scale electrical oscillations at a macroscopic level may contribute to a larger extent. Regardless the specific neural mechanism, the steps between neuronal activity and BOLD involves coupling cellular metabolism and cerebrovascular reactivity (Davis et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2001; Sheth et al., 2004). fMRI signals are ultimately an indirect reflection of neural activity that cannot offer details on specific neuronal firing patterns as measured by electrophysiological techniques (Buzsaki et al., 2007; Logothetis, 2008). On the other hand, the measurement and mapping of neural signals over extended regions of the rat brain is unmatched by these techniques.HardwareMR scanner The high field MR scanner produces the external B0 field and contains the spatial encoding gradient coils that are oriented along the longitudinal z and transverse x–y axes. The use of 4.7 and 7 T horizontal bore systems for rodent applications have been optimal both because of the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and good T2/T2* contrast for functional studies. Scanners with high quality spatial encoding gradients, automated shimming (for correcting small field variations around the brain), and pre-installed pulse sequence routines that run on user-friendly console software are of choice for many applications-driven laboratories. At higher fields it is possible to obtain an in-plane voxel resolution for functional scans of about 390–469 μm2 with 12–20 coronal slices (1–1.2 mm slice thickness). This covers most of the rat brain from the olfactory bulb to the cerebellum using T2 weighted fast spin echo (FSE) sequences with minimal anatomical distortions (Figure 1). For localized rat brain studies with fewer slices, focusing on the coordinated activity of a few subsets of areas, the in-plane resolution can be increased to 100–250 μm2. An advantage of having higher resolution images is that they can create voxels that better localize activity in the cortex (see columnar level resolution studies in Kim et al., 2000). However, the smaller voxel size results in lower SNR especially at lower field strengths.Figure 1 Consistent somatosensory activation with ventrum trunk stimulation across awake fMRI studies. Top images show four representative rat coronal brain slices with significant increases in BOLD bilaterally in the cortical representation ventrum. Colored pixels overlaid onto high-resolution anatomical scans indicate significant differences from baseline (p < 0.05, corrected using false-detection rate (Genovese et al., 2002)). Atlas map to the right shows the somatosensory trunk region (Paxinos and Watson, 1997). Bottom panel shows the temporal profile of the BOLD signal response to ventrum stimulation (mean ± SD). Arrows shows onset of stimulus. Data were acquired using a T2 weighted fast spin echo sequence at 4.7 T (effective TE = 53 ms and TR = 8.3 s). Many fMRI studies have been performed using gradient echo echo planar imaging (GE EPI) because of its greater sensitivity to magnetic susceptibility and the BOLD effect. Gradient echo sequences use rapidly changing MR gradients to excite protons into the transverse plane (rather than using RF pulses). However, because of the same susceptibility effects, the GE EPI is highly vulnerable to signal loss at air-tissue interfaces in the temporal and paranasal regions. This leads to loss of data in important areas such as the ventral hippocampus, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex (Febo et al., 2004b; Ludwig et al., 2004). GE EPI has a high sensitivity to physiological noise and shows anatomical distortions (spatial warping) that can produce alignment and registration errors. Most modern MR console software contains built-in algorithms that correct these distortions. However, to correct the spatial warping, additional scan time must be added to acquire field maps that aid in unwarping reconstructed images. Finally, GE EPI sequences are more sensitive to intravascular and extravascular large vein signals that are distant from the actual foci of activity (Duong et al., 2003). Spin echo EPI (SE EPI) at high fields are more sensitive to intra and extravascular compartments closer to the capillaries and therefore are commonly used for fMRI studies at higher field strengths (Duong et al., 2003). At high fields, T2 weighted spin echo sequences appear to suffer less from the aforementioned issues (Duong et al., 2003; Goense and Logothetis, 2006; Poser and Norris, 2007; Ye et al., 2011). Single shot spin echo sequences (SE EPI) and multi-segmented T2 weighted FSE can be used successfully with rats. The latter has been the sequence of choice for many of our experiments in awake rats. There is support in the literature for the use of FSE and SE EPI sequences for BOLD imaging (Duong et al., 2003; Goense and Logothetis, 2006; Poser and Norris, 2007; Ye et al., 2011). Figure 1 illustrates the results from a study of the rat somatosensory cortex (Febo et al., 2008). In the study, awake female rats were stimulated on the ventrum skin while being imaged at 4.7 T using a T2 weighted FSE sequence (TR = 8 s and TE = 53 ms). We observed increased BOLD signal intensity in areas that correspond to the trunk region of the primary somatosensory cortex (Figure 1). This was observed in all the tested animals. Temporal profiles of the BOLD signal are shown for seven individual rats just to give an idea of the variability between subjects. Figure 2 further supports the notion that T2 FSE sequences provide BOLD weighting. Awake rats were provided with 5% CO2 in inspired air during functional scanning. A rise in signal intensity is observed at the specific times in which animals are exposed to hypercapnia. Switching back to normocapnic conditions results in a return to baseline signal intensity. This global cerebrovascular reactivity is due to changes in CBF in the absence of alterations in neuronal activity. These two studies indicate that BOLD signal changes may be of neural (Figure 1) and also of vascular origin (Figure 2).Figure 2 Vascular reactivity contributes to BOLD signal changes. The figure illustrates how hypercapnic conditions can elevate the BOLD signal in the absence of any neural stimulus. The activation map on the left shows dramatic increases in BOLD with 5% CO2 inhalation during functional image acquisition. Plot on the right shows the timecourse of BOLD signal intensity changes over the course of the scanning. Plots are shown for four individual rats, each showing a similar pattern of BOLD signal change. The gray bars below indicate the interleaved epochs of normocapnia and CO2 exposure. Data were acquired using a T2 weighted fast spin echo sequence at 4.7 T (effective TE = 53 ms and TR = 8.3 s).RF coils and accessory equipment Studies of the rat brain using MR scanners require the use of RF coils that serve as the source of the B1 field (the 90 and 180 degree pulses) that excite water protons in tissue to the transverse planes. The RF coils also serve to detect longitudinal and transverse signal relaxation. There are varieties of coils that are used for neuro-applications. Many laboratories construct their own RF coils (Ugurbil et al., 2003; Doty et al., 2007). These are usually single copper wire loop tuned to the magnet frequency (4.7–7 T or 200–300 MHz range, respectively). The coil is aligned over the area of interest, such as over the head overlying the cortex. The loop coil configuration, however, has less spatial coverage and usually results in signal drop from dorsal to ventral areas of the brain that makes this type of configuration less favorable for developmental studies. The configuration prohibits coverage of signals from brain structures such as the hypothalamus and midbrain that are farthest in distance from the coil. This can be overcome by using a dual RF coil system built into an MR compatible restrainer of the head and body (Ludwig et al., 2004), or a quadrature coil system with improved B1 coverage of the brain (EkamImaging Inc., Shrewsbury, MA, USA; Figure 3).Figure 3 Awake animal setup used in our studies. Top images show a quadrature radiofrequency coil system. Images on the left show (from top-to-bottom) step-by-step procedures for setup in the rat dual coil system. Figure on the right illustrates animal movement during functional scanning. Shown are plots of displacement in mm from the center of mass. Note that the most dramatic movements are in the y-axis (up and down) direction. Newer coil designs minimize this form of movement. In addition to the main electronics that are needed to run functional brain scanning in rats there are also other useful accessory devices. For anesthetized preps, beds with integrated head and/or body holders are important to place animals correctly inside the bore of the magnet. Typically these are necessary to align animals correctly within the isocenter of the MR spectrometer prior to image acquisition. Physiological monitoring devices are also an essential part of the animal imaging setup. This includes MR compatible temperature probes, pulse oximeters, capnometers, electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) recorders, respiratory pillows and transducers, and other devices according to the needs of the investigator. The physiological measures are used to “gate” the image acquisitions to remove respiratory and cardiac pulsations that can appears as low frequency artifacts (Purdon and Weisskoff, 1998; Peeters and Van Der Linden, 2002; Bhattacharyya and Lowe, 2004). Stimulation devices may be needed when evoking sensory responses, such as for whisker and forepaw stimulations. The stimuli for sensory evoked responses can be timed to the functional image acquisitions for accurate correlations with BOLD signal responses during block design studies.Animal Experimental PreparationsAnesthetized preparation Anesthetized preparations are used extensively for fMRI studies in rats. The methods used generally are not suitable for longitudinal studies in the same population of animals. In many applications the femoral artery of the rat is catheterized to allow the sampling of arterial blood gases and a close monitoring of arterial blood pressure and pH during scanning. Changes in the partial pressures of blood gases may be indicative of alterations of basal conditions that can alter the magnitude of the BOLD signal. This is important since hypoxia and hypercapnia modulate baseline BOLD signal in the rat, perhaps independently of basal neural activity and metabolism (Bandettini and Wong, 1997; Cohen et al., 2002). Figure 2 shows an example of this. Controlling for movement is also important and some laboratories use chemical agents that can suppress muscle contractility during scanning. Marota et al. (2000) used the paralyzing agent pancuronium to eliminate unwanted respiratory pulsations in the anesthetized rat. Others have used the muscle relaxant gallamine to paralyze animals during MR scanning (Xi et al., 2004). The animals in the cited studies were tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated during experiments (Marota et al., 2000). The experimenter-controlled activity facilitates “gating” procedures to remove artifacts without significant spontaneous variations in breathing rate. From a strict engineering approach, this rigorous methodology is ideal given the tenuous quality of the BOLD signal. Despite some of these advantages, however, the invasive procedure precludes long-term developmental studies in rats. Alternatively, arterial blood pressure and respiration rates can be measured non-invasively using a pulse oximetry over the tail of the rat and a respiratory pillow placed just underneath the animals’ chest.Awake setup Our laboratory has utilized methods to image awake rats as an alternative to imaging under anesthesia. Before this is done, however, animals must be acclimated to the restraint conditions and MR pulse sequence noise. The procedures for acclimation are carried out for 5 days prior to collection of imaging data. Both acclimation and actual imaging experimental setup procedures are done under similar conditions. Rats are first anesthetized under 2–4% isoflurane gas to enable placement into a head restrainer (Figure 3). There is evidence that isoflurane anesthetized animals regain motor function and coordination within minutes (Eger and Johnson, 1987), and thus, volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane are useful when quick setup and awakening are desired. An important part of the restraint setup are the ear bars that allow the proper orientation of the head (Figure 3). A semi-circular plastic headpiece containing blunted ear bars are first placed over the animal’s head and fitted into the ear canals. These are non-invasive (requiring no surgery) and are not made of abrasive or harmful material. Their placement is the same as standard stereotaxic ear bars. Other laboratories have taken another approach, that is, to bolt or permanently affix the holders to the skull of the animals to ensure that the animals will not be able to move during scanning (Miller et al., 2003; Sachdev et al., 2003; Desai et al., 2011). We have not found that this approach is necessary. The animal is then guided through the center of the coil/head holder unit and the incisors placed over a bite bar. A plastic latch locks down over the nose with a screw. The lateral ear bars contain outer grooves that accommodate lateral screws that are used to align the animal in the holder and fix its position in the restrainer. The body is placed into a tube that has shoulder bars and an overlying square plastic peg that prevents up-and-down movement during scanning. The entire system is placed into a chassis that fits the bore of the magnet and can be fastened inside of it. In the experience of the author, the setup time is quite short (∼10 min). The system has plenty of room to accommodate accessory equipment for stimulus delivery or physiological monitoring (see above). The above system allows the rodent to remain in a semi-crouched position while being scanned (forelimb movement is more restricted). Figure 3 shows movement along the z and x–y directions inside the scanner. As may be observed, most movement comes from the y direction (up and down movements). The rats seldom move in the back-and-forth (z) and side-to-side (x) if positioned correctly. The design of the newer coil system used in our laboratory (Febo and Pira, 2011) minimizes the y direction movement. Other groups have used positioning screws that are affixed to the skull and have obtained good results. For example, Desai et al. (2011) carried out fMRI-optogenetic experiments in awake restrained mice. The mice had miniature plastic screws affixed to the skull. They used a short (3-day) acclimatization period and provided animals with “treats” after restraint sessions. It is possible that both approaches will yield good results, and perhaps using cranial fixtures to prevent movement may be preferable for methods that include additional invasive procedures during fMRI scanning.Potential Effects of Anesthetics and Restraint StressEffects of anesthetics on basal neuronal firing Motion must be minimize during MR scanning (Figure 3). Both gross movements (for example, slow shifts in head position, sustained or transient leg motion, chewing, vocalizations) and physiological motion (pulsations due to cardiac and respiratory cycles) can significantly degrade multi-repetitions MR scans. It can also contribute to false activation patterns that correlate motion with stimulus presentations (Freire and Mangin, 2001). In our laboratory, we prescreen and process data for motion artifact and signal drift that may arise from different sources. Images with minor artifacts are realigned using in house software or Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). Of course, anesthetizing animals during scanning also minimizes motion artifacts but this reduces the magnitude of the BOLD signal in the rat brain (Lahti et al., 1999; Peeters et al., 2001). There are significant lines of evidence suggesting that agents typically used for anesthetizing animals can suppress certain forms of neuronal activity and modify specific patterns of neuronal activity and metabolism. For instance, there are differences in basal and stimulated brain glucose utilization (cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, or, CMRglu) and CBF in awake vs. anesthetized rats (Nakao et al., 2001). Stimulation of the whisker-to-barrel cortex pathway resulted in differential CBF and CMRglu across regions when rats were anesthetized with halothane (Nakao et al., 2001). The results of the latter study suggest that although the barrel cortex is active in the anesthetized state, other regions along the pathway arising from the stimulation of peripheral sensory receptors are suppressed and may thus require a conscious state (Nakao et al., 2001). Evoked potentials in the barrel field cortex have been shown to vary between anesthetic conditions (Martin et al., 2006). The amplitudes of field potential responses to graded levels of repetitive electrical stimulation to the whisker pads are reduced to a greater degree in anesthetized vs. awake rats (Martin et al., 2006). Firing of action potentials over localized regions of the awake rat visual cortex showed higher frequencies and bursting but lower pair-wise correlations between single units than ketamine-anesthetized rats (Greenberg et al., 2008), suggesting that the propagation of actions potential in localized networks is modified by the induction of an anesthetized state. Halothane, isoflurane, and desflurane can differentially affect gamma band oscillations in the rat cortex (Imas et al., 2004, 2005). This is important because field potential activity is believed to correlate well with BOLD signal changes. Graded levels of isoflurane (1.8–2.2%) also suppress EEG bursts measured in the primary sensory cortical area representing the forelimb of the rat and also reduced spontaneous variations in CBF (Liu et al., 2011). These levels of isoflurane are within the range that causes suppression of bursting in sensory cortical EEG patterns (Hartikainen et al., 1995). Research on the role of anesthetic agents in modulating neuronal activity raises concerns about the use of deep levels of anesthesia for rat brain imaging experiments (Austin et al., 2005; Masamoto et al., 2009; Angenstein et al., 2011). Variations in the pattern and magnitude of neuronal activity will vary according to anesthesia type and concentration. This underscores the importance of parsimony when interpreting data from studies with anesthetized animals. It is impossible to infer the animal’s baseline state and unwarranted to assume that functionally interconnected regions respond similarly in awake and anesthetized conditions (Nakao et al., 2001).Effects of anesthetics on cerebral hemodynamics In addition to the cited neural actions, anesthesia can influence global cerebrovascular reactivity. The choice of anesthetic and calibration of the depth of anesthesia are therefore important. The effects of volatile anesthetics on the BOLD signal, CBF, and CBV have been investigated. Hypercapnia-induced BOLD signal changes, which occur in the absence of neuronal activity, are of much greater magnitude in awake rats (Brevard et al., 2003). This suggests that cerebrovascular reactivity is affected by anesthesia. It is also important to note that basal levels of O2 metabolism and neuronal spiking frequency in the cortex are reduced by deep levels of alpha-chloralose (Hyder et al., 2002). The results of the latter study provide evidence that basal conditions might be associated with the magnitude BOLD signal changes. Larger magnitude changes in BOLD may reflect lower basal firing of neurons in animals that are deeply anesthetized whereas lighter levels of anesthesia allow for smaller magnitude changes in BOLD in the face of higher basal activity (Hyder et al., 2002). Thus, the absence of neuronal recording methods or imaging methods to assess CBF may lead to incorrect interpretation of the magnitude of the BOLD signal. Basal CBF levels in 2% isoflurane anesthetized rats were observed to be greater than in the awake state (Sicard et al., 2003). Isoflurane anesthesia can act as a vasodilating agent that increases blood flow. The percent change in CBF and BOLD in response to CO2, however, is lower in anesthetized rats (Sicard et al., 2003). The lower magnitude response could be due to higher basal levels of blood flow (Sicard et al., 2003). Thus, in isoflurane anesthetized animals there seems to be direct modulation of CBF that is independent of the effects on neuronal activity (Masamoto et al., 2009). Isoflurane reportedly increases CBF globally due to its vasodilating actions (Liu et al., 2011). Spontaneous CBF changes are suppressed by increasing levels of isoflurane from 1.8 to 2.2% (Liu et al., 2011). Thus, light sedation with isoflurane (<1.8% in inspired air) might minimize the above-described effects. It has also been reported that alpha-chloralose specific parameters for forepaw stimulated BOLD activity in the somatosensory cortex do not work under isoflurane anesthesia (Masamoto et al., 2009). The accumulating evidence underscores the importance of considering the effects of anesthetics on both neuronal activity and cerebrovascular reactivity when designing fMRI studies and interpreting the data. Finally, a fundamental concern of anesthetized preparations is that, as a preference of choice or perhaps based in published data, different laboratories vary their use of specific types of anesthetic agents. These include volatile anesthetics, such as isoflurane, desflurane, halothane, urethane, and injectable agents, such as medetomidine, ketamine, alpha-chloralose, and others. There is growing evidence that the different agents may have varying effects on BOLD signal and neuronal activity, and this could potentially lead to variations in findings between laboratories. Austin et al. (2005) compared the effects of halothane levels and alpha-chloralose on cortical stimulation evoked BOLD activity and found that the amplitude responses with varying levels of halothane were unchanged, whereas deepening anesthesia levels with alpha-chloralose lead to greater amplitude evoked responses (Austin et al., 2005). Indeed, a similar finding is reported by Masamoto et al. (2009), however, the latter study seems to show greater variability in peak CBF and summed field potential responses with alpha-chloralose than with isoflurane (Masamoto et al., 2009). BOLD functional connectivity (FC) analysis during resting state is also hindered by variations of the type of anesthetic chemical used. Medetomidine anesthesia allows better-localized correlations between seed voxel regions (higher specificity of correlated regions) and isoflurane has the opposite effect on FC analysis (Williams et al., 2011). It appears that FC analysis works optimally under isoflurane with concentrations in the range of 0.5–1.0% but fails at higher levels (2.9%; Wang et al., 2011). Frequency-dependent changes in amplitude BOLD and field potential responses to forepaw stimulation were observed over a wider range of stimulation frequencies under urethane (1–15 Hz) than under alpha-chloralose (1–3 Hz; Huttunen et al., 2008). Therefore, two laboratories implementing different types of anesthetics, say urethane in one and alpha-chloralose in the other, may result in disparate results. There are no optimal anesthetic types that can be used that will produce entirely reproducible findings across laboratories that carry out discovery-oriented research. The development of the technique, given the above-summarized data, should be to employ the technique in awake conditions wherever possible.Restraint stress Stress is one of the biggest factors that present challenges to designing and interpreting fMRI data in awake animals. One of the concerns of acclimation is that it may produce chronic stress exposure to the animals. Is the type of restraint used for imaging equivalent to the form of restraint used in studies investigating the chronic effects of immobilization stress? The latter usually uses a wire mesh that restricts total movement while the imaging setup only involves restraint of the head while the limbs and torso are not restrained. Thus, the imaging setup seems to involve intermittent stress that may have transient and not chronic effects. Do any residual chronic stress effects during acclimation have a permanent impact on brain physiology and behavior? This question really attends to the permanent changes that have been reported using other chronic stress models such as the social defeat stress model (Tornatzky and Miczek, 1993) that may result in animal groups that are in an overall depressed state or a state of behavioral despair (Krishnan and Nestler, 2008). Whether or not stress is present in restraint-acclimated rats is not a matter of debate. The aim is to determine whether the effects of stress are at tolerable levels. King et al. (2005) reported that various physiological variables (e.g., respiratory rates, blood pressure, corticosterone levels) of Sprague-Dawley rats are reduced following 5–8 days of restraint. Most measures are reduced near to pre-stress baseline levels on day 4–5. An important outcome however was that there was a significant increase in contrast to noise while no changes in basal CBF values were noted. This could signify that the lower gross movement and physiological rhythms improve image quality. At the same time it points to the brains autoregulatory capacity in awake rats that remains intact regardless of whether or not they are acclimated (King et al., 2005). The data are consistent with reports indicating that rats habituate to repeated daily 1–2 h restraint for 4–9 days (Melia et al., 1994; Dhabhar et al., 1997). Rats show normal patterns of food intake and heart rate following habituation to restraint (Haleem, 1996; Stamp and Herbert, 2001). Importantly, habituation to repeated daily sessions of restraint is not necessarily indicative of impaired hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis function, since rats acclimated to restraint stress still show increased c-fos activation and corticosterone levels to a novel stressor (Melia et al., 1994). Recent unpublished work from my laboratory provides evidence that 22 kHz ultrasonic “distress” calls are reduced by day 4 and 5 of acclimatization in comparison to day 1 (Figure 4, unpublished results by Michael Reed and Marcelo Febo). At the same time struggle movements diminish in these animals when tested on a forced swim assay (Figure 4). One interpretation might be that animals are in a state of behavioral despair and are therefore not struggling. However, when viewed collectively the tests point to signs of physical and behavioral adaptations to the restraint conditions. The results support less struggle movements reported previously in Sprague-Dawley rats (King et al., 2005). Therefore rats seem to be fully capable of adapting to the head restraint conditions.Figure 4 Effects of restraint over the course of 5 days on struggling time in a forced swim test and on the emission of 22 KHz ultrasonic vocalizations. R, restraint; NR, no restraint; NR + Rest, no restraint and re-test after 2 weeks of rest. Star indicates significant difference between R Day 1 and R Day 5 conditions (p < 0.05 paired t-test). A central question is whether animals adapt to stress and is this adaptation indicative of learning or an overall impairment of the HPA axis and a resultant depressed behavioral state. There is partial support in the literature against the latter assertions. Parry and Mcelligott (1993) devised a method for head immobilization in awake rats in order to study central regulation of cardiovascular function. They reported that side-by-side acclimatization of rats to restraint reduced the stress of individual animals that are being acclimated. We have used a similar acclimatization procedure in our studies in which groups of animals are simultaneously exposed to daily sessions of restraint. Heart rate and blood pressure normalized after initial exposure to restraint indicating that the procedure was minimally stressful (Parry and Mcelligott, 1993). Barnum et al. (2007) investigated the hyperthermia effects of chronic restraint stress and compared these to other forms of stress such as the social defeat model and isolated cage confinement (Barnum et al., 2007). They observed that corticosterone and stress-induced hyperthermic responses to restraint stress adapted after 5–6 days of repeated exposure. However, this was not observed for the social defeat stress model indicating that the two forms of stress have different outcomes. There have been reports of the differential reactivity of the HPA axis to stress and immunological challenge across various strains of rats. Our initial experiments were all in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats while the more recent work is performed in Long Evans. Dhabhar et al. (1997) investigated the chronic effects of stress on adaptation of the HPA axis in SD, Lewis and F344 rats (Dhabhar et al., 1997). SD and Lewis rats showed adaptations over the course of the 4-h immobilization stress paradigm as well as during the 10-day chronic regime of stress whereas F344 rats did not in either case (Dhabhar et al., 1997). Despite the reported evidence of adaptations to stress, there are important long-term effects that should not be overlooked. Naert et al. (2011) report a “depressed-like state” in rats chronically exposed to repeated restraint stress. This included behavioral changes while in the elevated plus maze indicative of higher anxiety levels, changes in hedonic state as measured by the sucrose preference test, depressed locomotion and a reduction in body weight by 17% (Naert et al., 2011). The adaptation was accompanied by HPA associated changes in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF) expression, corticotropic releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels suggesting several biological markers for plasticity within the stress axis (Naert et al., 2011). It is important to keep in mind, however, that these studies use very intensive stress exposure schedules. Most studies looking at immobilization stress restrain animals for 90–120 min a day or more. King et al. (2005) reported a maximum time spent under restraint of 90 min. Ferris et al. (2008) have had success with 60-min daily sessions over the course of 4–5 days. Animals are imaged the day after the last acclimatization session or several days later. Our laboratory has had success as well with incremental steps in restraint duration (20, 40, up to 60 min). Success is measured by the proportion of animals that are imaged without gross motion and physiological artifact. Figure 4 shows the significant reduction in 22 kHz ultrasonic “distress” calls during 60-min sessions over 5 days. In the above-cited study, the authors employed 3 h daily sessions for 3 weeks (Naert et al., 2011). In addition to being stressful, an extended stress paradigm imposes a physical challenge to animals that can reduce overall activity (see results in Figure 4). Results from an unpublished study in Figure 4 show that there is reduction in time spent struggling on the fifth day of restraint in comparison to the first restraint and FST session. The reduced struggle time, or a curtailed effort to escape, may be considered a sign of learned helplessness. However, an alternative explanation is that the effort to escape on the first day of restraint and FST is reduced on day 5 because of physical fatigue. Evidence for this comes from a group in Figure 4 showing data for rats restrained for 5 days and then re-tested 2 weeks later (R + Rest). These animals recover their levels of struggle time to levels observed in the first day of testing. This result, in addition to supporting an adaptive behavioral mechanism, also suggests that experiments should ideally be carried out immediately after day 5 of restraint acclimation procedures. Animals may again increase movement if not imaged before 2 weeks (Figure 4). Reduced exposure time to intermittent daily sessions may therefore minimize the effects seen with longer chronic restraint sessions. Evidence indicates that intensity of a stressor may have more of an impact than the duration on the subsequent stress responsiveness of the animal (Garcia et al., 2000). However, there is residual impairment of HPA ACTH responses with immobilization stress (Garcia et al., 2000). The question remains whether all stressors are equal and whether immobility stress as classically studied has the same neurobiological and behavioral impact as the head restraint used in functional neuroimaging studies. There have been a host of other studies seeking to understand adaptations to restraint stress and whether the changes involved permanent modifications of the rodents brain (causing long-term changes in the behavioral and neural responses; Kant et al., 1985; Briski and Sylvester, 1987; Pierzchala and Van Loon, 1990; Girotti et al., 2006). This latter effect may not be entirely avoidable. Indeed, even single exposure to immobility stress can have long-term effects on behavior, such as cross-sensitization of responses to stressors (Belda et al., 2008).Experiments in Awake Rats and Data Interpretations The methodology for imaging awake animals is recent enough that it has not yet been used across a broad spectrum of applications. The work in our laboratory has focused on studies of the effects of psychoactive substances, aggressive motivation, and the neural basis of maternal behavior during lactation. In both cases the methods employed can be of great use for studies seeking to understand neurodevelopmental changes during distinct reproductive stages of rats. The guidelines described apply to any investigation in which BOLD fMRI data are acquired. There have been significant studies employing in vitro methods assessing cerebral glucose metabolism following acute and repeated cocaine exposure (Porrino et al., 1988; Stein and Fuller, 1992, 1993; Hammer et al., 1993). Since the rewarding and psychomotor properties of cocaine are attributed to changes in neuronal and synaptic activity within mesocortical and mesolimbic systems (Einhorn et al., 1988; Chang et al., 1998), we used fMRI to investigate the neural actions of cocaine in awake animals (Febo et al., 2004b). Prior to this experiment there were several human functional imaging experiments investigating changes in brain activation following intravenous cocaine administration (Breiter et al., 1997; Kaufman et al., 1998; Li et al., 2000), however, experiments seeking to understand the developmental events leading to an addicted state cannot be studied in humans. Animal studies carried out in anesthetized rats are hampered by the use of general anesthetics for the reasons cited above (Marota et al., 2000; Mandeville et al., 2001). We used spin EPI in unconscious rats at 4.7 T following an intracerebroventricular injection of cocaine (20 μg) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (10 μL). Within 5 min of injection, there was a significant increase in BOLD signal intensity in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, dorsal striatum and prefrontal cortex, as compared to vehicle controls (Figure 5). Minimal negative BOLD signal changes were observed in response to cocaine and no significant perturbations in normal cardiovascular and respiratory function. The findings demonstrated the technical feasibility of studying psychostimulant-induced brain activity using functional MRI in conscious rats. The results using BOLD fMRI corroborate findings from previous animal studies. Metabolic mapping with radiolabelled deoxyglucose showed cocaine-induced, site-specific glucose utilization in the multiple areas of the brain (London et al., 1986; Porrino et al., 1988). In a follow up study the repeated effects of cocaine were examined using the same methods. Seven days of pretreatment with cocaine significantly reduced the BOLD response to the drug. Although the lower BOLD response to cocaine appeared to be a generalized and non-specific effect, several brain areas of acutely and repeatedly treated rats did not show differences in BOLD signal intensity (namely, the dorsal prefrontal cortex, cingulate, and somatosensory cortex). In addition, the lower BOLD response was not associated with differences in cerebrovascular reactivity between the two treatment groups, as measured by brief exposure to hypercapnia. One explanation proposed for the decreased BOLD response observed is that it might be associated with the previously observed decreases in glucose metabolism (Hammer et al., 1993) and could also be related to reductions in basal and cocaine-stimulated synaptic monoamine concentrations (Imperato et al., 1992; Kalivas and Duffy, 1993; Parsons et al., 1996). Alternatively, the reduced BOLD response could be due to differences in basal cerebrovascular reactivity.Figure 5 Cocaine-stimulated increases in BOLD in the medial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens. To left shows a rat coronal atlas map highlighting the medial PFC (red) and the accumbens (blue). Below is a representative rat coronal slice showing areas of increased BOLD as orange-to-yellow pixels. Plots on the right show changes in BOLD over time for the representative rat. Data are expressed in arbitrary units. Arrow shows onset of cocaine injection into the lateral cerebral ventricle. Data were acquired using a T2 weighted spin echo echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence at 4.7 T (effective TE = 55 ms and TR = 2 s). A series of experiments in awake lactating rats have been carried out using the methods described above. Many of these have focused on the neural processing of the natural suckling stimulus from pups (Febo et al., 2005b, 2008; Ferris et al., 2005; Febo and Ferris, 2007). It has been reported that suckling stimulation from pups modulates the expression of maternal behaviors in rats by promoting arched back nursing postures (Stern and Johnson, 1990; Stern et al., 2002) and slow-wave sleep (Lincoln et al., 1980; Blyton et al., 2002). The fMRI technique was used to map the cortical pattern of activity during suckling, and the stimulus was compared to artificial suction in the absence of pups and mechanical stimulation on the ventrum skin (Febo et al., 2008). During the processing of somatosensory stimuli, information coming from the landscape of peripheral sensory receptors underlying body skin surface is relayed to the cortex through the spinothalamic pathway and topographically represented in the cerebrum. In the case of the mammillae, primary afferent fibers terminate in the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglia between spinal segments C5 and L6 (Tasker et al., 1986), with afferent relays along the lateral cervical nucleus, the dorsal column nuclei and the sensory and spinal portions of the trigeminal complex (Dubois-Dauphin et al., 1985; Stern et al., 2002). In contrast with studies using c-fos assays that provide exquisite cellular spatial detail (Walsh et al., 1996; Lonstein and Stern, 1997; Lin et al., 1998; Lonstein et al., 1998; Lee et al., 1999), the detection of real-time brain activity during the actual act of nursing is limited by the very wide temporal window (usually taken 60–120 min post-stimulus). Findings from electrophysiological recordings taken from neurons in the somatosensory cortex of the anesthetized rat indicate that the receptive field for the ventrum skin surrounding the nipple area doubles in size during the lactation period (Xerri et al., 1994). It was found in the fMRI study that wide areas of the postpartum rat cerebrum exhibit an increase in the fMRI BOLD signal during suckling stimulation, suggesting that neural activity is modified over wide areas of the cerebral cortex in response to a rather specific stimulus (Febo et al., 2008). The artificial suckling stimulus caused a similar degree of cortical activation. Therefore, although auditory, olfactory, and non-suckling tactile stimulation from pups may contribute to cortical activity, the suckling itself is fully capable of causing a widespread cortical response. There have been experiments examining the patterns of brain activity in mothers presented with infant sensory cues, but as yet, none have investigated the effects of the lactational stimulus. Our rat studies suggest that there would be significant cortical activation not only in limbic cortical divisions, as reported previously (Lorberbaum et al., 2002), but in areas that might correspond to long-term memory storage. These are cortical representations of the suckling stimulus that might be important for the maternal–infant bond during the early lactational period. This remains to be tested in primates, including humans. One should be cognizant of the biological underpinnings contributing to the BOLD signal in order to interpret fMRI results. A few concepts, which are based on the literature across several fields of research, have been presented in Section “Physiology of the BOLD Contrast Mechanism”. The simplistic designation of “activation” or “deactivation” is often used to refer to increases in BOLD or statistically significant interactions between variables of an fMRI study. The terminology has allowed an easy interpretation of fMRI findings across many human and animal studies. However, one cannot infer neuronal excitation and inhibition without direct neurophysiological measurements. If the ultimate goal of the study is to identify and/or attribute a general role for a brain region in a task or in responding to a stimulus, then the simple terminology can be helpful. If, on the other hand, the goal is to investigate and infer complex neuronal processing then it is really not. Whatever the case, the prudent MR imager needs to keep in mind the multiple factors that play key roles in generating the BOLD signal and the statistical maps that are present in many research studies (see Figure 6). Shown in Figure 6 are several factors that underlie or influence the BOLD signal and that have been briefly discussed in the preceding sections. The cooperative synaptic activity of clusters of neurons generates neural signal changes that can be measured by LFPs. These arise to a large extent from somatodendritic fields, with large net changes in extracellular electrical sources (current leaving cells) and sinks (current entering cells). The metabolic demand generated by such activity is “more than” balanced by the delivery of energy substrates in the bloodstream (Figure 6). Concepts of neuronal and vascular mechanisms should therefore be significantly relied upon during data interpretations. This should be accompanied by a clear understanding of the nature of the stimulus (whether simple or complicated) presented to the animal during fMRI scanning. What cannot be assumed is that BOLD signal maps are maps for receptor or protein distribution, as in autoradiographic, immunohistochemical and cellular c-fos assays, or that fMRI data show functional neuroanatomical connectivity (as would be observed in studies using orthodromic stimulation of a synaptic terminal region to record spike activity from a soma in a distant site). At the backdrop of the biological underpinnings are the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance, signal processing, and statistical mapping, which are at the heart of fMRI studies. The nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon is so disconnected from the neurophysiological underpinnings that it can make the understanding of functional neuroimaging data difficult. However, the biological link is, as stated above (See Physiology of the BOLD Contrast Mechanism), the hemodynamic mechanism that directly influences the MR signal, and that is, the ratio between HbO2 and dHb in the vascular and capillary bed surrounding areas of increased or decreased neuronal activity and metabolism (Figure 6). A greater value of HbO2/dHb (if one were to measure these variables directly) during stimulation vs. baseline periods is indicative of increased O2 in response to metabolic activation. As in the original Ogawa et al. (1990) work, a greater O2 tension resulted in increased local signal intensity, which is what is measured in most fMRI studies. This is most likely due to the lowered paramagnetic effects of dHb. Statistical mapping is also a very important area in animal imaging experiments and this will not be discussed here. Suffice it to say that there are significant differences between human and animal imaging both in terms of the software used and study design that absolutely have to be taken into account. It is of the author’s awareness that this is a source of great confusion to those that are not closely following the field of neuroimaging and that still find it difficult to trust the reliability of the MR methods compared with traditional techniques.Figure 6 Conceptual and technical considerations for functional magnetic resonance imaging of animals. The top images show several physiological and neuroanatomical factors that are important for data interpretations. These include knowledge of the tissue histological properties (e.g., layer specific organization of the cortex vs. heterogenous organization of other subcortical regions such as the striatum). For example, here in the middle are populations of neuronal soma typically found in layer 5 of the neocortex with overlying dendritic fields, which process incoming synaptic inputs. Electrophysiological correlates of this neural processing include local field potentials (shown in top right) that have been associated with BOLD signal changes. The BOLD signal is also associated with vascular-level changes such as tissue-capillary O2 exchange and changes in oxy-to-deoxyhemoglobin concentrations in red blood cells (shown in left). In the background, shown in the lower portion of the figure, are other technical and conceptual factors associated with the physical principles of nuclear magnetic resonance, image processing, and statistical mapping (see text Experiments in Awake Rats and Data Interpretations for details). In both the cocaine experiment and the lactation study cited above one assumes that the BOLD signal changes are predominantly related to changes in neuronal activity and not only due to increased blood flow (as in the case of Figure 2 where CO2 produces increases in BOLD without expected changes in neuronal activity because of the vasodilatory effects of CO2). Differences in percent changes in BOLD between the different experimental conditions are expected to represent differences in neuronal activity of comparable magnitude. Therefore, if one were to carry out the same experiments using similar procedures (e.g., restraint, acclimation, stimulus delivery) but instead record synaptic activity within the regions of interest, there would be comparable differences, for example, for changes in field potential activity. There are many reasons for considering that this is the case and these were discussed above. The direct action of cocaine, for example, on preventing the reuptake of dopamine and other catecholamines stimulates synaptic activity through increased firing and neurotransmitter metabolism. Suckling stimulation and mechanical stimulation on the ventrum increases intra-cortical processing of the sensory stimulus through net changes in synaptic firing with accompanying increases in metabolism (see Figure 1). However, as stated previously one cautiously interprets fMRI data in this direction since other biological mechanisms take effect and can alter the magnitude changes in BOLD. This could include effects on cerebrovascular reactivity for instance with drug treatments or with endogenous variations in hormones (Febo et al., 2004a, 2005a). Addressing changes in CBF can be performed by using arterial spin labeling methods as in Schmidt et al. (2006) or testing cerebrovascular reactivity between groups through CO2 challenges as in Febo et al. (2004a). These procedures can provide the investigator with direct and indirect assessments of basal hemodynamics. There has been other significant research in awake animals that have primarily focused on investigating the neural actions of pharmacological agents (Chin et al., 2011), investigations of the differences in the hemodynamic response function in awake vs. anesthetized rats (Martin et al., 2006), cerebellar dependent motor learning though eye-blink conditioning in the rabbit (Miller et al., 2003), FC studies of the awake rat brain (Liang et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011), combined examination of sensory neural processing in specific circuits using fMRI and optogenetics in awake mice (Desai et al., 2011), and awake Rhesus macaques and marmoset monkeys (Ferris et al., 2001, 2004; Brevard et al., 2006; Goense and Logothetis, 2008). The studies support the use of awake fMRI methods in neuroscience research and have been performed using a variety of elegant and creative custom procedures that will not be discussed here. In general, all involve head restraint and many of these used some form of training of animals prior to studies. Miller et al. (2003) used the rabbit model in their studies of eye-blink conditioning. These animals are resilient to restraint stress and thus provide an interesting model for awake imaging. There were changes in cerebellar BOLD signal responses during progressive conditioning trials that closely matched patterns of electrical activity during learning (Miller et al., 2003). Desai et al. (2011) recently used optogenetic methods that pair the virally mediated expression of photorhodopsin in glutamatergic neurons of the barrel field cortex to study light-stimulated increases in neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex of the awake mouse during fMRI. Light induced increases in neuronal activity produced BOLD signal responses in the barrel field region that were comparable to activation evoked by whisker deflection (Desai et al., 2011). This is an interesting study since it provides data on the role of excitatory activity on generation of the BOLD response but also because postsynaptic activity of pyramidal cells is considered to produce less energy expenditure compared to presynaptic activity. Therefore the BOLD responses here could correspond to local somatodendritic activity with the channel-rhodopsin mediated increase in activity. The combined use of fMRI and optogenetics may be an important future venue to those that are interesting in delving into the functional roles of specific neural circuits. To sum, interpretability of fMRI data is strong when used in conjunction with additional methods assessing neuroanatomy and neurophysiology and using multiple imaging modalities (BOLD and CBF). However, when the technique is used on its own it still provides important information on neural mechanisms particularly the responses to a variety of sensory stimuli. Interpretations should consider the methods employed (anesthetized vs. awake) and also the underlying assumptions of the BOLD signal as it relates to neuronal activity.Additional Considerations, Future Directions, and Alternative Applications Awake rat imaging can be used to investigate brain function and the actions of drugs in the brain, perhaps developmental processes as well. However it is important to keep in mind the underlying mechanisms of the BOLD fMRI technique when interpreting data. There are limitations to the use of the technique that mostly stem from the restriction of head movement in both anesthetized and awake preparations. This imposes an upper limit on the questions that can be asked regarding the relation of brain activity to behavior. Consider for instance the fact that motivational systems, such as the mesolimbic dopamine system, are involved in interfacing limbic and motor responses (Mogenson and Yang, 1991). Therefore, a limiting factor is that the technique lacks the ability to establish links between brain activity and many forms of motivational behavior and this is especially confounded in anesthetized rat preparations. Another factor to consider is the baseline hemodynamic state. When there are differences in the magnitude of the BOLD signal change this could originate from underlying neural mechanisms but may also be associated with changes in basal state of the cerebrovasculature. Methods are available to circumvent this latter issue using direct CBF measurements that quantitatively examine basal arterial flow and this can shed light on neuroadaptive changes contributing to differences among experimental groups. The field of MR see’s an ever-growing expansion of applications, conceptual considerations, and technical advances that will surely impact the use of animal imaging methods in the future. For example, BOLD signal decreases have not been mentioned here, although negative BOLD responses are pervasive in fMRI studies. There is empirical evidence for correlations between negative BOLD responses and decreased neuronal firing (Shmuel et al., 2006). The estimates from this latter study find that almost 60% of negative BOLD signal changes may correspond to reductions in multi-unit and field potential activity (Shmuel et al., 2006). However, there are also significant experiments that indicate that the negative BOLD responses are associated with “vascular-steal” (Harel et al., 2002). That is, areas adjacent to the site of activity lose blood to areas that are most active. Under normal circumstances, one of these two scenarios may explain negative BOLD responses. In other instances, high temporal resolution scans at high fields can resolve initial transient negative BOLD responses that are related to immediate increases in O2 metabolism and extraction from plasma (Kim et al., 2000). However, most fMRI studies do not report this effect since it is overridden by dramatic increases in CBF after the onset of neural activity. There are two other scenarios that relate to the negative BOLD response, these include the post-stimulus undershoot (Buxton, 2002) and conditions which result in uncoupling between CBF and CMRO2 (the latter exceeding CBF changes; Schridde et al., 2008). An example of this latter case is given by Schridde et al. (2008), which observed long-lasting BOLD signal reductions while at the same time measured CBF increases during bicuculline-induced seizures in rats. Interestingly, this was region specific since the mismatches were most prominent for the hippocampus rather than the cortex. Therefore, exceedingly high levels of CMRO2 may have occurred during seizure activity that could have resulted in negative signal responses. The negative BOLD responses that are observed in most studies that do not intend to modulate inhibitory activity are difficult to explain. More data are needed in order to understand and perhaps even modulate negative BOLD responses rather than positive BOLD responses (Desalvo et al., 2011). Finally, as discussed in Section “Physiology of the BOLD Contrast Mechanism,” the Larmor equation establishes a relationship between precessional frequency and field strength. Based upon this relationship it may be possible that increasing field strength could increase signal to noise and better spatial resolution in functional images. There are several experiments that are pursuing this direction, which should be of great importance in future work employing murine models (Silva and Koretsky, 2002; Seehafer et al., 2011). Other techniques that have not been discussed can significantly contribute to investigations in different fields of neuroscience and animal imaging. These include techniques such as manganese enhanced MRI (MEMRI), FC analysis and fiber tracking using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). For example, in MEMRI manganese chloride is used as an intracellular contrast agent that enhances T1 signal intensity on high-resolution MR images. The Mn2+ ion is taken up by actively firing neurons through calcium channels and reflects synaptic activity more directly and in a quantitative manner (Aoki et al., 2002; Pautler et al., 2003). There is substantial experimental validation of the technique in its different variations. For example, one study showed a comparable match between BOLD signal and T1 enhanced signal intensity due to Mn2+ uptake in the somatosensory cortex (Duong et al., 2000). There have been many more applications of the technique (Saleem et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2005; Nairismagi et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007). Therefore, when used correctly the technique can provide accurate information regarding the functional neuroanatomical organization of the brain. The temporal resolution is very sluggish compared to fMRI, taking several hours rather than seconds, but can still be used to examine correlations between synaptic activity and behavior (Lu et al., 2007) and to investigate functional neural circuits (Saleem et al., 2002). MRI and fMRI techniques are invaluable in many neuroscience fields. Many issues regarding anesthetized and awake animal imaging have been discussed here and continue to be investigated further. As we understand the effects of restraint, anesthetics and as more tools for preprocessing and analyzing data become available, applications of the technology in animal studies will prove to be an even more powerful tool for brain research. Ultimately this requires close collaborations between neuroscientists in different disciplines and engineers at academic imaging laboratories.Conflict of Interest Statement The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

While the state of these cells plays an important role in whether and how the behavior is displayed, information from outside the brain is also required. Often, this information is provided by hormones that are present in the circulating fluid (such as the blood). However, the brain is protected by a layer of very tight cells, the so-called blood–brain barrier, that keeps unwanted molecules out. So how then do hormones and other regulatory factors “talk” to the brain? We are studying this question by examining the mating behavior of males of a model organism, the fruit fly . We have found that the blood–brain barrier cells themselves contain male-specific molecules that play an important role. When they are absent, courtship behavior is compromised.

Introduction Male courtship in Drosophila melanogaster consists of a series of consecutive behavioral steps that are well characterized (for reviews see [1]–[3]) and include orientation towards the female, tapping of the female's abdomen with the male's forelegs, performing of a courtship “song” by wing extension and vibration, licking of the female's genitalia, attempted copulation and copulation. The behavior is controlled by the master regulatory genes of the general somatic sex determination pathway Sxl, tra, dsx and fru [4]–[6]. A cascade of sex-specific alternative splicing results in males that express the transcription factors DSXM and FRUM, and females expressing DSXF (the FRU protein is not made in females). Both FRU and DSX are expressed in defined subsets of neurons in the brain and abdominal ganglia, with expression overlapping in some of these neurons. A number of experiments have demonstrated that both dsx and fru are required for normal male courtship behavior ([7]–[12]; reviewed in [13]–[16]) and several recent studies have identified dsx and fru neuronal projections that form putative circuits that confer the competence for male courtship behavior [10], [17]–[19]. While fru and dsx neurons are indispensible for male courtship, another, non-neuronal tissue has emerged as an important regulator: the fat body. The fat body (which is often compared to the mammalian liver) is a secretory tissue that surrounds the brain, the abdominal ganglia and the abdominal organs. Among other important aspects it functions in metabolism, energy storage, immune function and yolk protein synthesis in females. It also produces sex-specific factors that are required for full male courtship behavior [20], [21]. When, by genetic means, the fat body is made female in an otherwise normal adult male, courtship behavior is strongly reduced, indicating that it produces sex- specific factors [22]. These experiments are feasible because sex determination in flies is mostly cell-autonomous. In agreement with this finding, several other screens for sex-specifically expressed genes in fly heads, and for genes that are controlled by dsx and fru, resulted in the identification of genes that are expressed in the fat body [23]–[26]. The fat body secretes proteins into the hemolymph, the open circulatory system of the fly. Takeout, one of the male-enriched fat body proteins with a role in male courtship, has been shown to be secreted into the hemolymph and act as a secreted protein [22]. This is likely also the case for other sex specific fat body proteins. How such hemolymph proteins interact with the brain circuits that control courtship is unknown. Since flies possess a blood–brain barrier (bbb), hemolymph proteins do not have unrestricted access to brain neurons. Nothing is known about the mechanisms by which these proteins negotiate the blood–brain barrier. The Drosophila bbb consists of two glial cell layers that ensheathe the entire brain, ventral ganglion and peripheral nerves. The inner or subperineurial glia (SPG) cell layer is situated next to the neuronal cell bodies and forms the tight barrier that is characteristic of vertebrate and invertebrate blood–brain barriers [27]–[30]. The vertebrate bbb is formed by tight junctions between blood endothelial cells [31]. In contrast, in Drosophila, septate junctions form the basis of the barrier, similar to mammalian myelinating glia at the paranodal junctions. Several studies have identified important proteins that are required for the development of a tight and functional barrier, several of which are evolutionarily conserved [29], [30], [32]–[35]. While insight into the development of the Drosophila bbb has been gained, very little is still known about the adult bbb and the mechanisms that underlie its function (for a review see [36]). Interaction of hemolymph components with the brain will likely involve specific receptors, transporters and signaling events. A Drosophila ABC transporter Mdr65 that functions similarly to the mammalian human MDR1/Pgp has been described [37]. Furthermore, the putative GPCR moody that is specifically expressed in the SPG barrier cells has been shown to mediate the behavioral response to ethanol and cocaine independent of its developmental function in barrier set up [28]. In order to approach the question how sex-specific circulating factors communicate/pass through the bbb in order to exert their function, we examined whether the sexual identity of the bbb itself might be required, and whether moody signaling in the bbb is a component in the regulation of courtship behavior. We report here that the bbb contains sex specific factors that are important for male courtship, and that moody and Go protein signaling in the bbb are important regulators of this behavior.ResultsFeminization of the blood–brain barrier reduces male courtship behavior To examine whether the bbb has a sex-specific role in male courtship behavior, we used the sub-perineurial glia specific Gal4 driver SPG-Gal4 [30] to express a UAS- TraF transgene. TraF is a female-specific regulator of the sex determination cascade and expression of TraF has been shown to specifically feminize the cells in which it is expressed [38]–[40]. We used two different SPG-Gal4 lines with insertions on the second or third chromosome, respectively, to express TraF (gifts from R. Bainton). Males whose bbb layer was feminized court females significantly less than the wild-type control males (Figure 1a). Their overall courtship index (CI) was significantly reduced. The CI is the fraction of time a male spends performing any of the steps of the courtship ritual within the observation period. When we quantified individual courtship steps, we found that latency (the time to first orientation towards the female) was the same in control and experimental animals. This indicates that the mutants are not deficient in their perception of the female and her pheromones. In contrast, the fraction of time spent extending a wing to perform the courtship song and the number of copulations were significantly reduced, in agreement with the overall reduction in courtship (Table 1). These data show that males with feminized blood–brain barrier are capable of all steps of courtship, but perform them with reduced probability. This is not due to locomotion defects, since males with feminized bbb perform indistinguishably from control flies in a short term activity assay [41] (Figure 1g). In this assay, individual males are placed in a courtship chamber and the number of time they cross a drawn line is counted. To corroborate that the observed courtship reduction is caused by the feminization of glial cells, we used repo-Gal4, a driver that is expressed not just in the bbb but generally in glial cells [42]. We observed a similar reduction, confirming that the male identity of glial cells is important for male courtship (Figure 1b, 1h). This would predict that a similar effect should be observed if these cells were made “less male”. Since TraF acts through its downstream targets fru and dsx we next examined the effect of expressing RNAis that target these transcripts in bbb cells. Indeed, SPG-Gal4/UAS-fruRNAi and SPG-Gal4/UAS-dsxRNAi males showed similar reductions as SPG-Gal4/UAS-TraF animals (Figure 1c, 1i). This suggests that FRU and DSXM both have a role in regulating sex-specific molecules in the bbb. It also argues that the effect of TraF is not due to merely overexpressing female-specific DSXF.10.1371/journal.pgen.1003217.g001Figure 1The sexual identity of bbb cells is important for courtship.

Indices that are significantly different from the controls are marked by asterisks. a) Expression of UAS-TraF using two independent bbb-specific SPG-Gal4 drivers on the third (3) or second (2) chromosome significantly reduces male courtship. b) Expression of UAS-TraF using the glial driver repo-Gal4 significantly reduces male courtship. c) Expression of UAS-fru RNAi, UAS-dsx RNAi and UAS-TraF in the bbb by SPG-Gal4(3) similarly reduce male courtship in comparison to controls.

Flies were injected with 10 kDa TR-dextran (red) and dye penetration into or exclusion from the brain was observed by confocal microscopy. The brain nuclei are stained with DAPI. A tight bbb is observed by a demarcated red line on the surface of the brain indicating exclusion of TR-dextran from the brain in the CS control (d) and SPG-Gal4/UAS-TraF (f) males. e) For comparison, dye penetration is shown in moody null flies which have a compromised bbb [28]. g, h, i) Activity assays for the genotypes assayed in a, b, c). While there is some variation among controls, likely due to genetic background, none of the mutant courtship phenotypes can be attributed to a difference in activity in comparison to the controls.10.1371/journal.pgen.1003217.t001Table 1Individual courtship elements in SPG-Gal4/UAS-TraF males.+/SPG-Gal4+/UAS-TraFSPG-Gal4/UAS-TraFCourtship Index0.90±0.020.91±0.0180.31±0.056**(All Steps of Courtship)Latency (s)14.9±4.9414.8±5.2216.1±3.7(Time to first orientation toward female)Wing Extension Index0.72±0.040.77±0.040.12±0.04**(% of total observation time)Wing Extension0.79±0.0270.85±0.0410.33±0.076**(% of total courtship time)Attempted Copulations2.8±2.254.3±1.630.6±0.33 Individual courtship steps in a standard courtship assay were analyzed for males of the indicated genotypes paired with a wild-type virgin female.

For wing extension, the relative time engaged in this behavior relative to the total time spent courting was calculated. For attempted copulation, the total number of events is given. Copulation was not scored since the females were only a few hours old and resisted copulation.** Values that were significantly different from those of the control flies. An important question that arises from these results is whether the feminization of the bbb affects the blood–brain barrier permeability. To address this question we performed a dye penetration assay [28], [37]. An intact bbb will exclude a 10 kDa Texas-red-coupled dextran (TR-dextran) molecule from the brain, whereas in mutants with a defective bbb, the dye will penetrate through the bbb (Figure 1e). We injected 10 kDa TR-dextran into adult males that prior to the injections were raised and treated identical to the males in the courtship assay. After a 24 h recovery period, fly brains were dissected and dye penetration into the brain was examined by confocal microscopy (Figure 1d–1f). TR-dextran was efficiently excluded from the brain of males with feminized bbb (Figure 1d), indistinguishable from the CS wild-type control (Figure 1f). These results suggest that feminization of the sub-perineurial layer of the bbb does not affect blood–brain barrier permeability in an obvious way, but rather affects sex-specific physiological processes that are required for male courtship behavior. Because the sub-perineurial layer is formed during blood–brain barrier development [29], but also has a physiological role in adults [28], the observed reduction in male courtship behavior could be a result of developmental effects, an effect on the adult physiological function of the bbb, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we added a temperature sensitive tubP-Gal80ts transgene [43] to induce feminization of the sub-perineurial layer exclusively in the adult. Males were raised at 18°C and after eclosion kept at 18°C. At that temperature, the Gal80ts inhibitor is active and inhibits Gal4 from activating UAS-TraF. Mature adult males were then transferred to 32°C or 30°C before testing in the courtship assay. At 30°C and 32°C, Gal80ts becomes inactive, Gal4 is active and TraF is induced [43]. Control animals were continuously kept at 18°C (uninduced controls). The results are shown in Figure 2. Control genotypes at the uninduced (18°C) and induced temperatures courted normally. Uninduced Gal80ts20/Gal80ts10; SPG-Gal4/UAS-TraF males courted females normally. In contrast, induced Gal80ts20/Gal80ts10; SPG-Gal4/UAS-TraF males showed a reduction in courtship behavior. This effect was dependent on the length of induction. Induction at 32°C for 16 hours (Figure 2a) reduced courtship to a lesser extent than induction for 48 hours (Figure 2c). Extended induction at 30°C for four days did not reduce courtship further (Figure 2c) (30°C was chosen to reduce the impact of the extended heat-shock period). As observed in the feminization experiments not using Gal80, all experimental males were capable of performing all courtship steps, but they performed them less frequently. The reduction in the extended time-induced males was close to the reduction observed in the absence of Gal80, indicating that most of the observed effect was due to the effect of feminization during the mature adult stage. To explore this further, we examined Gal80ts20/Gal80ts10; SPG-Gal4/UAS-TraF males that spent most of their development at 30°C. Due to lethality of the higher temperature during earlier stages, we moved the flies from 25°C to 30°C on day 5, when third instar wandering larvae began climbing up the wall of the vial. The critical time period for behavioral sex-determination has been shown to lie in pupal stages [4]. As shown in Figure 2d, extended heat conditions lowered overall courtship somewhat in the controls. In the Gal80ts20/Gal80ts10; SPG-Gal4/UAS-TraF males the courtship index was reduced similarly to the reduction in the SPG-Gal4/UAS-traF males shown in Figure 1a, relative to control flies. However, these males rarely showed courtship behaviors beyond their initial orientation to the female. These results may indicate a developmental component when feminization occurs throughout extended stages. We next tested whether males that had spent most of their development at 30°C could be rescued by shifting them back to 18°C after eclosion. As shown in Figure 2e, a fraction of these flies was rescued and showed wild-type courtship scores (8 out of 20). The rest, rather than being partially rescued, did not improve. This “all or none” rescue may indicate a threshold effect. However, the males that did show rescue demonstrate the importance of correct male identity of the bbb cells in the adult. Taken together, our experiments demonstrate a significant sex-specific role of the bbb in the control of male courtship and suggest that sex-specific molecules in the bbb play a crucial physiological role in the regulation of courtship.10.1371/journal.pgen.1003217.g002Figure 2Conditional adult expression of UAS-TraF by SPG-Gal4(3) reduces male courtship.

N = 20 for all genotypes unless indicated otherwise. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparisons (p<0.0001). Indices that are significantly different from the controls are marked by asterisks.

Flies were grown at 18°C until eclosion and either kept at 18°C for 8 days until testing (induction −), or kept at 18°C for 6 days and then shifted to either 32°C for 2 days, or to 30°C for four days, as indicated in the table below the graph (N = 20). d) Courtship index of flies shifted from 25°C to 30°C as wandering third instars for the rest of development and throughout adult life prior to testing. e) All flies were shifted from 25°C to 30°C as wandering third instars for the rest of development. Upon eclosion, they were either down-shifted to 18°C for 8 days and then tested, or kept at 30°C until testing on day 4, as indicated in the table below the graph.The blood–brain barrier–specific Moody G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) is required for male courtship behavior Signaling molecules are likely candidates for mediating the courtship role of the bbb, but very little is known about proteins that are expressed in this layer. Among them, moody is a good candidate for such a role. moody encodes a putative GPCR that has been shown to be specifically expressed in the sub-perineurial glia (SPG) layer of the blood–brain barrier. While moody is required developmentally for the formation of a tight bbb [29], it has an independent role in the response of adult animals towards ethanol and cocaine [28]. The gene encodes two different protein isoforms, Moody-α and Moody-β that are formed by differential alternative splicing [28]. moody null mutant animals (moodyΔ17) are lethal with a leaky bbb, although a few escapers can survive into adulthood. Addition of either a moody-α or a moody-β encoding transgene is sufficient to rescue the lethality and the leakiness of the bbb [28]. However, despite their intact bbb, moodyΔ17; moody-α or moodyΔ17; moody-β flies are mutant in their sensitivity to ethanol and cocaine, demonstrating that both protein isoforms are required for the behavior [28]. We tested the courtship of moodyΔ17; moody-α and of moodyΔ17; moody-β flies and found that their courtship was significantly reduced (Figure 3a). However, the reduced courtship behavior was rescued when both transgenes were present. The mutant genotypes did not affect short term activity, as shown in Figure 3b. We conclude from these experiments that moody-α and moody-β are both required in the bbb for normal courtship behavior.10.1371/journal.pgen.1003217.g003Figure 3moody-α and moody-β mutants have courtship defects. The graph shows the courtship index CI (fraction of time males spend courting during the observation period) ± SEM of the indicated genotypes, or the performance of males in a control activity assay (# of line crossings ± SEM). N = 20. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparisons (p<0.0001). Indices that are significantly different from the controls are marked by asterisks. Δ17 is a moody null mutant with a leaky bbb. The bbb barrier defect can be rescued by the addition of either the Moody-α or Moody-β protein isoform [28]. a) In contrast, despite the intact bbb, expression of only one isoform is not sufficient for normal courtship. moody-α and moody-β mutants have a courtship defect. When both the Moody-α and Moody-β isoforms are present in moody Δ17 mutants, courtship is restored to wild-type levels. b) The activity of the mutants is not different from that of control flies. When we analyzed RNAseq data generated from adult male and female heads [44] we found that the moody isoforms are expressed differently in the two sexes (Figure 4). There are four moody RNA isoforms that differ in their use of two transcription start sites and by differential splicing (by 2 nucleotides) of one of the introns that generates either the α or β protein isoform [28]. Of the four previously identified isoforms (http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0025631.html), one (FBtr0303041-moody-RA) was not detected in adult heads. FBtr0303043 (moody-RB) which encodes an alpha isoform is significantly enriched in males, whereas FBtr0303044 (moody-RC) and FBtr0303045 (moody-RD) which encode beta isoforms are enriched in females. However, our courtship data presented in Figure 3a show that both α and β isoforms are required for courtship in males.10.1371/journal.pgen.1003217.g004Figure 4moody transcript isoforms are expressed differently in males and females. a) Coverage plots, junction plots and gene models [44] for moody are shown.

F: Female; M: Male; FDR: False discovery rate; FC: Fold change.Go signaling in the blood–brain barrier is required for male courtship behavior Since Moody is a putative GPCR that potentially signals through G proteins, we next examined the importance of G-protein signaling in the bbb for male courtship behavior. We tested mutant flies for each of the known G- proteins in Drosophila: Go, Gs, Gi, and Gq. In addition, we tested a RNAi mutant of a fifth Gα subunit (concertina) that has been shown to be present in the fly genome [45]. It has been reported that Go signaling is required for blood–brain barrier insulation during development [29] and G-protein mediated signaling is required throughout development. Therefore, to circumvent developmental lethality, we conditionally expressed mutant forms of the proteins only in adult mature males using the Gal80ts system. To specifically inhibit Go we used the bbb specific SPG-Gal4 to drive expression of pertussis toxin (PTX) (Figure 5a, 5b). The S1 subunit of PTX from B. pertussis specifically ADP-ribosylates vertebrate G(i/o/t) proteins, resulting in their inability to bind to activated GPCRs [46]. Flies do not have Gt, and their Gi lacks the site for ADP ribosylation. Thus, PTX in flies is specifically inhibiting Go [47]–[49]. After the induction of PTX expression in the SPG layer for 12 hours at 32°C, we observed a significant reduction in male courtship behavior (Figure 5a). A breakdown of courtship into the different steps indicates that in the mutants latency is normal, but the probability that a male will re-initiate and sustain courtship beyond the first steps is lowered, although all steps, including copulation, can be carried out (Table 2). In addition, flies with induced PTX expression are normal in the short-term activity assay (Figure 5b). As a complementary approach to the inhibition of Go signaling by PTX, we conditionally reduced Go signaling in bbb cells by Gαo-RNAi. In agreement with the PTX results, Gαo reduction in adult mature males reduced male courtship (Figure 5c). Short-term activity of the mutants was normal (Figure 5d). To examine whether interference with Go signaling in adult males affects the integrity of the bbb, we performed TR-dextran dye penetration assays. Conditional adult expression of PTX or Go-RNAi in the blood–brain barrier does not affect the insulating properties of the blood–brain barrier (Figure 5e–5h). Conditional bbb expression of dominant mutant forms of Gs and Gi [50], [51], and of Gq-RNAi and cta-RNAi had no effect on courtship (Figure 5i–5l), although the mutant Gs and Gi proteins have previously been shown to be active and affect development [29], [50], [52]. We also did not observe a courtship phenotype when we disrupted PKA signaling, a potential downstream effector, by expressing PKA*, a dominant persistently active mutant catalytic subunit [53]. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that Go signaling in the bbb is physiologically required for the regulation of normal male courtship behavior.10.1371/journal.pgen.1003217.g005Figure 5Go signaling is required for courtship. Graphs show the courtship index CI (fraction of time males spend courting during the observation period) ± SEM of the indicated genotypes, or the performance of males in a control activity assay (# of line crossings ± SEM). N = 10. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparisons (p<0.0001). Indices that are significantly different from the controls are marked by asterisks. a) Conditional adult expression of UAS-PTX by SPG-Gal4 significantly reduces male courtship. The S1 subunit of PTX from B. pertussis specifically inhibits Go in Drosophila. UAS-PTX expression is restricted by the presence of tubP-Gal80ts at 18°C (induction −). Placement of 5-day-old males at 32°C for 16 hours (induction +) releases the inhibition and leads to the expression of PTX. b) The mutants have activity levels similar to the controls. c) Conditional adult expression of UAS-Gαo-RNAi by SPG-Gal4 significantly reduces male courtship (this genotype was induced for 3 days); the mutants have activity levels similar to the controls (d). e–h) The blood–brain barrier does not show leakage in SPG-Gal4/UAS-PTX (PTX) (e, f) and SPG-Gal4/UAS-Gαo-RNAi (RNAi) (g, h) mutants. Uninduced (18°C; e, g) and induced (32°C; f, h) mutant males that were treated identically to the ones tested in courtship were injected with 10 kDa TR-dextran (red) and dye distribution was observed by confocal microscopy. Brain nuclei are stained with DAPI. A tight bbb is observed as a demarcated red line on the surface of the brain indicating exclusion of TR-dextran from the brain. i–l) Conditional expression of dominant mutant versions or RNAi targeting Gαi, Gαq, Gαs and concertina (cta) in the bbb using SPG-Gal4(3). 5-day-old males were induced by placement at 32°C for 16 hours. m) Similarly, conditional expression of PKA* (a persistently activated PKA catalytic subunit) in the bbb did not affect courtship.10.1371/journal.pgen.1003217.t002Table 2Individual courtship elements in SPG-Gal4/UAS-PTX males.+/Gal80ts10; +/SPG-Gal4+/Gal80ts20; +/UAS-PTXGal80ts10/Gal80ts20; SPG-Gal4/UAS-PTX−+−+−+Courtship Index0.91±0.020.92±0.020.92±0.020.95±0.020.94±0.010.61±0.11**(All Steps of Courtship)Latency (s)4.1±2.086.1±2.734.7±1.457.9±2.87±2.778.86±2.53(Time to first orientation toward female)Wing Extension Index0.67±0.030.65±0.030.60±0.040.57±0.0460.59±0.0240.32±0.085**(% of total observation time)Wing Extension0.74±0.030.70±0.020.65±0.040.59±0.050.54±0.020.48±0.08(% of total courtship time)Attempted Copulations0.8±0.491.6±0.621.9±0.960.7±0.261.5±0.661±0.41 Individual courtship steps in a standard courtship assay were analyzed for males of the indicated genotypes paired with a wild-type virgin female.

Copulation was not scored since the females were only a few hours old and resisted copulation.** Values that were significantly different from those of the control flies.Discussion The blood–brain barrier is an important selective interface between circulating factors and the brain. We show here that the bbb also plays a crucial role in the regulation of male courtship behavior in Drosophila. When the bbb is feminized in an otherwise normal male animal, the courtship index drops significantly, indicating the presence of male-specific factors and processes in these cells. Importantly, while some of these sex-specific factors may affect sex-specific development of the bbb, our results demonstrate that feminization of the bbb exclusively in the adult is sufficient to reduce male courtship. Thus, male-specific factors are physiologically required in courting males. It is worth noting that the integrity of the bbb was not affected by feminization or by any other of our manipulations using a standard approach to examine bbb barrier function, although we can not rule out small defects. Therefore, the observed effects support the interpretation that feminization affects physiological sex- specific processes within the bbb. We show here that moody GPCR signaling is one of these processes. Normal courtship requires both moody isoforms, α and β, similar to the previously reported response to alcohol and cocaine. As has been described, moody appears to have two distinct roles: While either one of the moody isoforms is sufficient for a functional and intact barrier, both isoforms are required for adult signaling processes. Our RNA sequencing data suggest that the two isoforms are not present in equal abundance and that the ratio of the two isoforms is sex-specifically regulated. It is not clear at present why two forms of the moody protein are required in behavior. It is unlikely that a strict stoichiometric ratio of the two isoforms is required, since we have observed normal courtship in wild-type flies that express additional Moody-β (+/moody−β in Figure 3a). The two isoforms differ in their intracellular domain, which could indicate that they interact with different effector molecules that are both contributing to the behavioral response. We have observed courtship defects when either isoform is missing, indicating that both forms have a role in regulating courtship. Interestingly, we have observed that the ratio of the two isoforms is under the control of the sex-specific splicing factor TraF [44], raising the possibility that the moody pre-mRNA is a target for splicing regulation by TraF or one of its downstream effectors. It will be of interest to identify other sex-specific factors in the bbb and examine their contribution to the regulation of male courtship. We did not observe a courtship phenotype when we expressed dominant mutants for Gs and Gq that have been shown to act as dominant negative mutations in developmental processes [50]. Likewise, expression of Gi-RNAi or concertina-RNAi did not result in reduced courtship either. This suggests that these G proteins do not play a significant role in courtship in this layer. In contrast, we have observed courtship defects when Go signaling was compromised. We have employed two approaches to show that the heterotrimeric protein Go is required for male courtship behavior: inhibition by PTX and mRNA reduction by RNAi. The S1 subunit of PTX from Bordetella pertussis catalyzes the transfer of an ADP-ribose onto the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. In contrast to mammals, where PTX inhibits both Go and Gi, in Drosophila PTX is a specific inhibitor for Go, since the only Gi present (G(i)65A) does not contain the PTX recognition site. PTX will only ribosylate heterotrimers (not individual alpha subunits), and the consequence of this ribosylation is inhibition of the heterotrimer activation [46], [54]. The inhibition of Go signaling by PTX is therefore very specific; since the ADP-ribosylated Go heterotrimers cannot be activated, they do not generate ectopic Gβγ subunits, nor do they sequester free Gβγ subunits away from other Gα subunits. Conditional induction of PTX only in adult mature flies, as well as conditional adult reduction of Gαo by RNAi reduced male courtship. This demonstrates that physiological signaling through Go is an important signaling pathway that regulates courtship in the bbb. Given these findings it is likely that moody signals through Go to exert its function in courtship. In embryos, Go, Gi, moody and loco mutations each disrupt the formation of the bbb [29] and lead to bbb leakiness, as shown by dye penetration. In contrast, we did not observe dye penetration in the PTX and Go-RNAi mutants that we generated, further evidence that the developmental and physiological roles of moody and Go signaling differ in their mechanisms. We do not know what the downstream pathways are that are mediating the Go action. Few Go effectors have been demonstrated and its α or βγ subunits could be mediating the signal. In many cases in vertebrates it is the βγ subunits that are responsible for actuating signaling. In neurons, presynaptic voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have been shown to represent an effector for Go [55]. Studies of the role of Go in learning and memory in Drosophila have suggested that Go signaling does not occur through the rut adenylyl cyclase [47]. Signaling through Go is not generally thought to occur through PKA, consistent with our finding that disruption of PKA signaling in the bbb did not affect courtship. It is unknown whether potential downstream signaling molecules like loco, Gγ13F or PKC are sex-specifically expressed in the blood–brain barrier and might have a courtship role in this layer. In whole heads, PKC98E is male-preferentially expressed [44]. It is unknown what the ligand is for Moody and it remains to be seen what the exact role is for moody bbb signaling in courtship. Hemolymph factors that influence courtship could conceivably do so by initiating signaling pathways at the bbb, or by passage and transport through the bbb. Moody could be playing a role in signaling, as well as through a possible effect on transport, perhaps in processes similar to its previously demonstrated effects on the actin cytoskeleton during development [29]. Here we have demonstrated that sex-specific molecules in the bbb are important regulators of male courtship behavior in Drosophila. The Moody GPCR and Go signaling in this layer are an important part of this regulation. It will be of importance to identify the ligand(s) and downstream signaling events that ultimately interact with the brain circuits that control male courtship behavior.Materials and MethodsFly strains All flies strains were reared on standard corn meal/sugar-based medium at room temperature under non-controlled light conditions, except for Gal80ts flies that were grown at 18°C and induced as adults at 32°C or 30°C as indicated.

The Go RNAi strain UAS- CG2204 RNAi19124 (Transformant ID :19124) was obtained from the VDRC stock collection, Vienna.Gal80ts experiments For Gal80ts experiments, control and experimental flies were raised at 18°C. Virgin males were collected at eclosion and kept for 5–8 days at 18°C. Matured flies were then placed at 32°C or at 30°C for the times indicated in the text. For some of the temperature shift experiments, crosses were placed at 25°C for 5 days, when third instar wandering larvae began climbing up the walls. At that time the vials were moved to 30°C. Freshly eclosed males were individually put in vials and matured at the temperatures and for the time spans indicated in the figures. Only flies that eclosed within the first 24 hours were used. All flies were let rest for 1–2 hours at RT prior to the behavioral assay. Non-induced controls from 18°C were subjected to the same resting period of 1–2 hours at room temperature before testing.Behavioral assays The courtship assay and activity assay were performed as previously described [20]. In short, males were placed in a plexiglas “mating wheel” (diameter 0.8 cm), together with a 2–4 hrs old Canton-S virgin female. The courtship index was calculated as the fraction of time the male spent displaying any element of courtship behavior (orienting, following, wing extension, licking, attempted copulation, copulation) within a 10 minute observation period [6]. Short-term activity assays were performed as previously described [41]. Individual males were placed into the “mating wheel” containing a filter paper with a single line dividing the chamber in half. After 2–3 minutes of acclimation time, the number of times the male crossed the center line within the three minute observation time was counted. Each graph represents a full set of control and experimental genotypes that were grown, collected and aged in parallel. In each behavioral session, equal numbers of all genotypes were tested. The number of tested flies was equal for all genotypes in an experiment.Dye injection assay We injected 10 kDa TR-dextran into adult males that prior to the injections were raised and treated identical to the males in the courtship assay. The animals were anesthetized on ice and injected with 2.5 mM 10 kDa Texas-Red conjugated dextran (Invitrogen D-1863) in H2O as previously described [28] with slight modifications. Immobilized flies were kept cold by ice packs during dye injection. 0.1–0.3 µl of dye was microinjected into the scutellum of the fly. After injection flies were allowed to recover overnight. Flies were anesthetized on ice and fly heads were separated and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (EM grade, Polysciences Inc.) in 1× PBHS for 30 minutes at RT. Then the proboscis was removed and the heads were fixed for an additional 5 minutes at RT. The brain was finally dissected and washed in 1× PBS 3 times for 30 minutes each. The brains were mounted on a coverslip with Vectashield mounting media with DAPI (VectorLab) and observed with an Olympus FV100 confocal microscope. DAPI- stained cell nuclei were visualized at 405 nm, Texas red Dextran at 633 nm.Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed by one-way or two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc test. Statistical analyses were performed with Statview (Adept Scientifics, Bethesda, MD) or GraphPad Prism5.

Introduction Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the body lacks sufficient thyroid hormone. The thyroid hormone plays a fundamental role in the development, differentiation, proliferation and physiology of all cells in an organism [1], [2]. Therefore, inadequate thyroid hormone has widespread consequences for the body. Some studies have shown that hypothyroidism may induce delayed skeletal development [3], cardiovascular diseases [4], secondary hypertension [5], deterioration of human reproductive health [6], and changes in the brain structure and function [7]. The main treatment for hypothyroidism at present is thyroid hormone replacement therapy [8], [9]. However, due to difficulties in controlling the level of thyroid hormones through use of drugs or an exogenous source of thyroid hormone, although patients may experience partial relief of the symptoms, they usually suffer over-replacement which may result in an increased risk of cardiovascular disease [10], osteoporosis [11] and subclinical liver damage [12]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to seek new strategies for the management of hypothyroidism. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a unique medical system with the significant characteristics of pursuing an overall therapeutic effect with a multi-target treatment, attempts to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce drug-related adverse effects at the same time [13], [14]. According to TCM theory, the essential pathogenesis of hypothyroidism is “Kidney-Yang Deficiency Syndrome” [15], [16]. Here, kidney is not only the urinary organ, but it is regarded as the root of life activities and represents the origin of our congenital or inherited foundation [17]. To some extent, “Kidney-Yang Deficiency Syndrome” represents a condition of holistic exhaustion of the whole body. Modern medicine research indicates that “Kidney-Yang Deficiency Syndrome” is a functional disorder with varying degrees of hypothalamic-pituitary-target gland (thyroid, adrenal and gonad) axis [18], [19]. Sini decoction (SND), a well-known formula for invigorating Yang, is officially recorded in Chinese pharmacopoeia (2010 edition). It consists of Acontium carmichaeli, Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Zingiber officinate, and is mainly applied for “Kidney-Yang Deficiency Syndrome” [20], [21] and cardiovascular disease [22], [23]. Our previous studies have successfully validated the therapeutic effect of SND on cardiovascular disease [24], [25]. However, it is still lacking of the evaluation of the holistic and synergistic efficacy of SND on hypothyroidism due to the complexity of hypothyroidism and the active compounds in SND. This dilemma calls upon the debut of metabonomics at the end of last century. The metabonomic approach as a top-down and nonhypothesis-driven analysis holds the promise of a non-discriminatory analysis of metabolic biomarkers that could elucidate the pathogenesis of diseases and help monitor therapeutic response [26]. The systemic thinking of metabonomics and its aim at grasping integral function make it pillars of potential bridge between TCM and western medicine, which may beneficially provide an opportunity to open up the black box between evidence-based Chinese medicine and the organism [27]. To date, there has been wide applications of metabonomic approach in the field of TCM [28], [29], which strive to illustrate the efficacy and mechanism of ancient TCM on modern diseases and make further efforts to develop new drugs for complex diseases from the insight of TCM theory. Van Ravenzwaay's group [30]–[32] successfully employed standardized test protocols and metabolomics to discover new biomarkers and specific patterns in response to propylthiouracil (PTU)- and methimazole (MMI)- induced perturbations in rat plasma. Maria Klapa's group [33] applied metabolomic method to delineate significant alterations in cerebellar metabolic physiology related to hypothyroidism. However, little is known about the overall changes of urinary metabolites in an organism with hypothyroidism. In the present study, a UHPLC/TOF-MS based urine metabolomic approach was employed to characterize the status of thyroid dysfunction in three widely used rat models of MMI-, PTU- and thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism. In addition, in order to avoid the potential interference of drug interaction between antithyroid substances (MMI and PTU) and SND, we used the thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroid model to further investigate the protective effects of SND on hypothyroidism.ResultsEffects of hypothyroidism on the Body Weight (BW) time profiles Before the hypothyroidism models were established, there was no significant difference in body weight between control group (172.1±3.2 g), MMI group (171.4±2.9 g) and PTU group (173.5±3.4 g). However, body weight was markedly lower in MMI group (194.7±2.8 g; p<0.001) and PTU group (203.2±3.1 g; p<0.001) than in control group (251.2±3.6 g) after the antithyroid drug-induced hypothyroidism models were established. The BW time profiles for surgical groups during the animal study period are shown in Figure 1. There were no differences among these five groups before surgery (Day 0). During the thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism period (Day 1–Day 28), BW in the Sham and Sham + SND groups kept increasing sharply, while BW in the Hypo, Hypo + SND and Hypo + T4 groups followed a slowly increasing compared with the Sham and Sham + SND groups. During the treatment period (Day 29–Day 57), BW remained rising quickly in the Sham and Sham + SND groups and no significant difference between Sham and Sham + SND groups was observed, while BW in the Hypo group received a more slowly increase, and the BW in the Hypo + SND and Hypo + T4 groups showed an ascending trend compared with the Hypo group. In addition, the increasing trend is more distinct in Hypo + T4 group than in Hypo + SND group.10.1371/journal.pone.0055599.g001Figure 1The Body Weight (BW) profiles during the model and treatment periods. (box represents Sham group, triangle represents Sham + SND group, dot represents Hypo group, diamond represents Hypo + SND group, inverted triangle represents Hypo + T4 group).Biochemical analysis To validate the establishment of the animal model and the effects of SND and T4 on hypothyroidism, serum T3 and T4 levels were determined. The results in surgical groups are given in Table 1. The T3 and T4 concentrations decreased significantly 4 weeks after surgery in the Hypo, Hypo + SND and Hypo + T4 groups as compared to the Sham group. The numeral values of T3 and T4 in Hypo + SND and Hypo + T4 groups were obviously improved compared to the hypothyroid group after 4 weeks treatment. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference between Sham and Sham + SND groups in T3 and T4 concentrations throughout the experiment.10.1371/journal.pone.0055599.t001Table 1Sample determination of total triiodothyronine (T3) and total thyroxine (T4) in rat serum for the surgery-induced hypothyroid groups (mean±S.D.)a (n = 8).GroupT3T44w after Surgery4w after Treatment4w after Surgery4w after TreatmentSham group0.48±0.060.46±0.0547.66±5.1344.35±4.22Sham + SND group0.46±0.090.47±0.0645.52±3.7546.71±4.52Hypo group0.29±0.04**0.24±0.07**20.06±2.30***19.87±2.14***Hypo + SND group0.27±0.04**0.33±0.04#17.80±1.19***26.40±1.10##Hypo + T4 group0.29±0.03**0.43±0.03###18.49±1.37***35.18±1.22###a The unit of T3 and T4 is ng/mL.** p<0.01 (compared to Sham group),*** p<0.001(compared to Sham group).# p<0.05 (compared to Hypo group),## p<0.01 (compared to Hypo group),### p<0.001 (compared to Hypo group). There were no differences in initial T3 and T4 concentrations among control, MMI and PTU groups, but after 4 weeks of antithyroid drugs treatment, the T3 and T4 levels of MMI group and PTU group were strikingly lower than that of the control group (shown in Table S1).Assessment of the health status During the experimental period, rectal temperature, food intake and water intake were recorded before and after the hypothyroidism model established and after 4 weeks treatment in order to represent the health status of rats. The data in surgery- and antithyroid drug-induced hypothyroid groups were shown in Table 2 and Table S2, respectively. The results indicated that both thyroidectomy and antithyroid drugs (MMI and PTU) led to significant decline of rectal temperature, food intake and water intake in hypothyroid groups. After 4 weeks treatment with SND and T4, the health status of the rats in the Hypo + SND and Hypo + T4 groups improved with different degrees, while the Hypo group without SND or T4 treatment was still in a restrained state and got worse. Comparing the data from Hypo + SND and Hypo + T4 groups after 4 weeks treatment; it is found that T4 seemed to be more efficient in restoring water intake as compared to SND, while SND showed better efficiency in increasing rectal temperature than T4. And food intake was recovered dramatically in Hypo + T4 group, while no difference was observed between Hypo and Hypo + SND groups.10.1371/journal.pone.0055599.t002Table 2The physical variance for the surgery-induced hypothyroid groups (mean±S.D.)

To validate the stability of the established method, an in-house QC sample was prepared by mixing an equal volume (100 µL) from each sample and injected every 8 samples during the whole sample analysis [34]. A subset of peaks across the QC samples taking account of intensities and retention time was examined. It was found that the relative standard deviation (RSD) was below 0.5% for the retention time, and below 6% for the peak area in both ionization modes. To evaluate the repeatability, seven parallel samples obtained from a random urine sample were extracted by the same extraction method and injected continuously. The same subset of peaks was tested and the results showed that the RSD was below 0.5% for the retention time, and below 5% for the peak area in both ionization modes. The detailed data of stability and repeatability are listed in Table 3. The results indicated that the method was reliable for the subsequent analysis.10.1371/journal.pone.0055599.g002Figure 2Typical urine total ion current (TIC) chromatograms in positive ionization mode (A), negative ionization mode (B).10.1371/journal.pone.0055599.t003Table 3The result of stability and repeatability of the proposed method.Modem/zStability (n = 7)Repeatability (n = 7)RT (min)Peak areaRT (min)Peak AreaMeanRSD (%)MeanRSD (%)MeanRSD (%)MeanRSD (%)ESI+176.068213.420.052092313.1013.390.052107402.33194.07769.160.27132571401.209.150.14135377622.32218.103011.880.081480771.6211.920.351472751.39233.087610.930.0615740213.5310.900.0715857951.37314.231015.530.401296342.0715.530.411224821.41318.300815.960.287056981.3715.960.026950283.53487.157010.940.071105305.0810.980.051130773.32ESI−158.08206.260.1221267903.266.280.1819162013.35191.01901.210.4833859163.891.230.4535648374.23201.019913.420.06134226071.7913.430.09135678832.19218.10284.920.149658802.504.950.149872331.92357.107715.300.0325225961.1815.290.0326611580.89385.14609.150.0754043261.209.180.1155942870.98407.276016.430.0450571901.3916.400.445245081.81Multivariate statistical analysis of metabolites Before multivariate statistical analysis, peaks with a retention time less than 0.5 min (near to the dead time) were excluded due to a high degree of ion suppression that they suffered [35]. The datasets from positive and negative ionization modes contained 1018 and 1060 variables with control and MMI groups, the values were 899 and 1162 respectively with control and PTU groups, and the values were 957 and 909 with Sham and Hypo groups. The two datasets from positive and negative ionization modes were combined as a new dataset. To determine whether the metabolite fingerprints in urine differed between the control and hypothyroid groups in our metabonomic approach, we constructed partial least squares linear discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models which had been widely used in metabonomic study [36], [37]. In this study, three PLS-DA models were established and employed to identify biomarkers which were related to MMI-, PTU- and thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism, which are showed in Figure 3. Commonly, R2Y provides an estimate of how well the model fits the Y data, whereas Q2Y is an estimate of how well the model predicts the Y [28]. In order to gain high predictive ability, the values of R2Y and Q2Y should be close to 1. The related parameters of the three PLS-DA models are given in Figure 3. As Figure 3 shows, there is a distinguished classification between the clustering of the control and MMI groups (Figure 3A), the control and PTU groups (Figure 3B), as well as the Sham and Hypo groups (Figure 3C). The R2Y and Q2Y were all above 0.99 and 0.89 in the three models, respectively, which indicated that the models had good prediction characteristics.10.1371/journal.pone.0055599.g003Figure 3PLS-DA scores plot (top panel), loading plot (middle panel) and S-plot (bottom panel) of the UHPLC/TOF-MS spectral from control group (box) and hypothyroid group (dot). (A: control group vs MMI group; B: control group vs PTU group; C: control group vs thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroid group).Detection and identification of biomarker candidates To select potential biomarkers related to hypothyroidism, statistically significant differences for the variables between the Sham, Sham + SND, Hypo, Hypo + SND, Hypo + T4 groups were tested by ANOVA and the Tukey Post hoc test for comparisons of multiple groups. Metabolites that differed significantly between Sham and Hypo groups after correction for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate q<0.05) were identified as candidate biomarkers. Next, the corresponding loading plot and S-plot (shown in Figure 3) were used to further screen these candidate biomarkers, in which the ions furthest away from the origin contributed remarkably to the separation of the Sham and Hypo groups and may be regarded as potential biomarkers. Furthermore, the variable importance for projection (VIP) reflecting the importance of variables has been applied to filter the important metabolites in the model. In this study, metabolite ions with VIP value >1.5 were considered as potential biomarkers. Following the criterions above, 19 metabolite ions were selected as potential biomarkers related with thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism. With similar selection process, 17 and 21 metabolite ions were screened out as the biomarkers related with MMI- and PTU-induced hypothyroidism, respectively. The detailed method for the compound identification was described in our previous work [25]. In brief, the corresponding quasi-molecular ion peak was found according to the accurate mass and retention time in the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) and speculated the most probable molecular formula. Figure 4A shows the EIC of a typical ion whose m/z is 124.0073. Then, MS/MS analysis of m/z 124.0073 in urine was performed using UHPLC-Q-TOFMS in the same chromatographic and mass spectrometric conditions (Figure 4B). With its fragmentation information and the freely accessible databases, the fragment ion m/z 79.9576 was speculated to produce by the loss of –C2H6N. Therefore, the m/z 124.0073 was identified as taurine according to the elemental composition, retention time and fragmentation information. Finally, the MS/MS spectrum of the commercial standard taurine (Figure 4C) was used to confirm the identified compound. Similarly, 17, 21, 19 potential biomarkers related with MMI-, PTU- and thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism were identified and are listed in Table 4.10.1371/journal.pone.0055599.g004Figure 4Identification of a selected marker (m/z 124.0082).

A PLS-DA model based on the selected 19 related potential biomarkers was built. The R2Y and Q2 (cum) of the newly established PLS-DA model were 0.972 and 0.763 respectively, indicating that the model had a great ability of fitness and prediction. As shown in Figure 5A, a separation of the Sham and Hypo groups was clearly achieved, while the Hypo + SND and Hypo + T4 group was mainly located between the Sham and Hypo group, indicating that both SND and positive drug T4 had different degrees of protective effects on hypothyroidism. Meanwhile, Sham + SND group shared much overlap with Sham group, which demonstrated that there is no obvious difference between Sham and Sham + SND groups in metabolic patterns.10.1371/journal.pone.0055599.g005Figure 5PLS-DA scores plot to evaluate the therapeutical effects of SND. (A) PLS-DA scores plot derived from urine levels of 21 potential biomarkers in Sham group (dot), Sham + SND group (diamond), Hypo group (box), Hypo + SND group (inverted triangle) and Hypo + T4 group (triangle). (B) A time-related trajectory of metabolite patterns from PLS-DA model classifying the state of rats at different time points: before surgery (dot), after surgery (box), treatment for two weeks (diamond), treatment for three weeks (triangle); treatment for four weeks (inverted triangle). To better understand the time-related trajectory of the metabolic pattern with SND treatment from the very beginning of established hypothyroid model to the end of treatment, a score plot of PLS-DA map from the Hypo + SND group at various time points was illustrated in Figure 5B. In the map, each spot represented a sample, and each assembly of samples indicated a particular metabolic pattern at different time points. The starting spots of the Hypo + SND group before surgery obviously deviated from those after surgery, suggesting that high fluctuations occurred in the metabolic regulatory network after thyroidectomy. Furthermore, the spots of the Hypo + SND group at week 2 and 3 of treatment clustered near the starting spots gradually, showing a backward tendency towards the normal status before surgery, which might be an indication of the accumulated effect of SND. The last spots of the Hypo + SND group at week 4 of treatment ultimately approached the initial state, suggesting that SND showed recovering effects on the rats with hypothyroidism to some extent. To further compare the recovery condition of the 19 potential biomarkers by SND and T4, the relative intensity of the 19 biomarkers (the relative peak areas of the 19 biomarkers to their respective total integrated area of the spectra) between the five surgical groups were tested by ANOVA and the Tukey post hoc test for comparisons of multiple groups. The detailed data of relative intensity of 19 biomarkers in five surgical groups are given in Table S3. Compared to Hypo group, 6 of the 19 biomarkers including phenylacetylglycine, citric acid, kynurenic acid, phytosphingosine, uric acid and xanthurenic acid were significantly reversed by SND; while 8 of 19 biomarkers including phenylacetylglycine, allantoin, citric acid, creatinine, hypoxanthine, kynurenic acid, uric acid and dopamine were markedly restored by positive drug T4 (Figure 6). The other biomarkers were also regulated back to the relative normal status in varying degrees, except for xanthine. The results demonstrated that SND and T4 may play their therapeutical effects on hypothyroidism though various pathways.10.1371/journal.pone.0055599.g006Figure 6Comparison of different ions in urine of Sham group, Sham + SND group, Hypo group, Hypo + SND group and Hypo + T4 group after 4-week treatment. * p-Value<0.05 compared to Sham group, ** p-Value< 0.01 compared to Sham group, *** p-Value<0.001 compared to Sham group; # p-Value<0.05 compared to Hypo group, ## p-Value<0.01 compared to Hypo group, ### p-Value<0.001 compared to Hypo group.Discussion Hypothyroidism is a kind of complex disease and the symptoms present in more than one issue and even spread to the whole body. The dominant treatment for hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone replacement therapy at present because of its certain efficiency. However, it may largely focus on thyroid per se, but overlook the complexity of disease, integrity of organism, and the potential side effects to some extent. While TCM, a complex medical science, places the human body into a large system for observation and adjusts the human body to remain in a healthy status [38]. Therefore, key insights from this point of integrating western medicine and the core thinking of Chinese medicine may shed a new light on the treatment of hypothyroidism. In the concept of TCM, hypothyroidism belongs to the scope of “consumptive disease” or “asthenic disease”, and the essential pathogenesis of hypothyroidism is “Kidney-Yang Deficiency Syndrome”. Here, kidney is more than the urinary organ, but represents the foundation of every life activity in human body. Modern medicine research indicates that the functional disorder of hypothalamic-pituitary-target gland (adrenal, thyroid and gonad) has a tight relationship with “Kidney-Yang Deficiency Syndrome”. The Chinese medicine SND, one typical example of multicomponent medicine, is commonly applied for “Kidney-Yang Deficiency Syndrome” [20]. Especially, it is suitable to treat hypothyroidism, which is one of the most representive diseases caused by “Kidney-Yang Deficiency Syndrome”. Nevertheless, its holistic mechanistic understanding on hypothyroidism is still insufficient. Three typical hypothyroidism models (MMI-, PTU- and thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism) were applied to characterize the metabolic changes of hypothyroidism comprehensively. Among the selected biomarkers related with the three models, nine of them shared in all the three models, including N2-succinyl-L-ornithine, kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid, phytosphingosine, phenylacetylglycine, citric acid, taurine, hypoxanthine and hippuric acid. The three models are all involved in energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism. It is found that more biomarkers were selected related to phenylalanine metabolism in MMI-induced hypothyroidism model and purine metabolism played a specific role in thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism model. The detailed comparison of biomarkers and pathways for MMI- and PTU-induced hypothyroidism models is showed in Figure S1. Figure 7 depicts the integrative plot of the metabolites and the relevant pathways changing for thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism.10.1371/journal.pone.0055599.g007Figure 7The integrative plot of the metabolites and the relevant pathways changing for thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism in circulation system. Metabolites with red dashed area present significant increase in Hypo group compared to Sham group. Metabolites with blue dashed area present significant decrease in Hypo group compared to Sham group. In this study, a global urine metabolomic analysis based on UHPLC-TOF/MS was applied to provide comprehensive and complementary insights into hypothyroidism at the metabolic level. Based on the 19 selected biomarkers related to thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism model, the therapeutical effects of SND was assessed and compared with positive drug T4. The results demonstrated that both SND and T4 can improve the thyroid dysfunction with different degrees, by partially regulating energy metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and purine metabolism.Biochemical interpretation It has been well documented that cis-aconitate, succinic acid, citric acid and α-ketoglutaric acid are the vital substances of tricarboxylic acids cycle (TCA), which is the main pathway of glucose degradation and the primary energy supplier for universal organisms. In this study, these four pivotal intermediates of TCA cycle were significantly decreased in the hypothyroid group compared to the control group, suggesting that hypothyroidism may inhibit the TCA cycle markedly and ultimately reduce energy metabolism. It has been reported that the thyroid hormones influence the activity of TCA cycle and thyroid hormone-induced increase of mitochondrial Ca2+ and substrate supply can stimulate the overall TCA cycle activity [39]. A wealth of evidence further supports that hypothyroidism remarkably reduces the biogenesis and respiratory capacity in free mitochondria and neuronal oxygen consumption in the cerebral cortex in developing rats [40]. The decreased level of TCA cycle in our study indicated that hypothyroidism was related with energy metabolism dysfunction, which quite agreed with the results of previous studies about thyroid disorder [18], [33], [41]. Dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine, two ceramide-related metabolites detected in this study, were dramatically decreased, indicating that sphingolipid metabolism turned to be abnormal in response to hypothyroidism. These two metabolites play important roles in sphingolipids biosynthesis and metabolism, and convert into ceramide [42]. In our study, the reduced pool size of dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine consequently resulted in a decrease in ceramide. Ceramide is the vital second messenger in the sphingomyelin signaling pathway and its content is regulated by the thyroid hormone [43]. Gorska.J et al found that hypothyreosis reduced the total content of ceramide in rat tissues [44]. Precious studies showed that PTU-induced hypothyroidism would affect the synthesis of sphingomyelin in chick liver microsomes [45], which is consistent with our observation that sphingolipid metabolism was also involved in hypothyroidism. In our study, the abnormal variations of phenylacetylglycine, dopamine, phenylethylamine, hippuric acid and homovanillic acid suggested that phenylalanine metabolism was greatly disturbed by hypothyroidism. These potential biomarkers are the metabolites of phenylalanine and tyrosine. It is well known that phenylalanine can be converted firstly to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase, and then to catecholamines (e.g. dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine) [46]. When the hypothyroidism models were made in the study, the pathway of phenylalanine may be partly blocked, in which metabolites of phenylalanine and tyrosine were excreted to urine increasingly. It has been reported that CSF levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine are closely related to thyroid function [47] and neonatal hypothyroidism induces striatal dopaminergic dysfunction [48]. From these findings, we can infer that hypothyroidism may be involved in phenylalanine metabolism. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and serves a variety of roles in metabolism. Hypothyroidism patients commonly have symptoms of anorexia and poor appetite, it is reported that a dietary tryptophan deficiency can alter thyroid hormone levels [49]. In addition, it was observed in our study that kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid, indole and indoxyl, the metabolic products of tryptophan, ascended considerably in the hypothyroid group compared with those in the control group. The unusual increased catabolism of tryptophan may aggravate the shortage of tryptophan in vivo. Some studies have shown that the deficit of tryptophan can lead to thyroid dysfunction [50], [51]. Therefore, the altered contents of kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid, indole and indoxyl at present may predict the abnormality of tryptophan metabolism in hypothyroid rats. Taurine is considered to be the second most abundant in the body's muscle after glutamine. Taurine supplementation can play a protective role against the increased oxidative stress resulting from hypothyroidism by raising serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities [52], [53]. The decreased level of taurine and its metabolic product 5-L-glutamyl-taurine, observed in urine metabolite profiles of hypothyroid group compared with the controls, may be a cue of deregulation of taurine and hypotaurine metabolism in hypothyroidism. In addition, it is of note that the specific relationship between other disturbed pathways here (e.g. arginine and proline metabolism, purine metabolism etc) and the occurrence of hypothyroidism remains obscure and awaits further investigation by combining with other data (proteomics, transcriptomics and genomics) in the future.Mechanism supposition of SND The primary function of thyroid hormone is to run the body's metabolism, so it is understandable that patients with hypothyroidism will have symptoms associated with a slow metabolism, which mainly result from insufficiency of oxygen utilization. It has a close relationship with mitochondria, because the most prominent role of mitochondria is to produce ATP through respiration by utilizing oxygen and to regulate cellular metabolism. It was reported that SND, a “Yang-invigorating” Chinese tonifying herb, might speed up ATP generation by protecting mitochondria from oxidation injury [54], [55], which often occurs in the hypothyroid condition. It was found in our study that four intermediates of TCA were up-regulated in the Hypo + SND group compared to the Hypo group, indicating that SND could enhance mitochondrial function and body metabolism. According to TCM theory, the corn pathogenesis of hypothyroidism is “Kidney-Yang Deficiency Syndrome”. The Chinese medicine SND, which can recuperate the depleted Yang and rescue patients from cases of exhaustion of Yang-energy [56], is quite fit for the treatment of hypothyroidism. SND is composed of three crude drugs: Acontium carmichaeli, Zingiber officinale and Glycyrrhiza uralensis. Acontium carmichaeli was historically recorded as one of “The Four Pillars” of Chinese herbs, as the principal drug in the famous formula SND, invigorating Yang of kidney greatly and treating weak diseases in human [57]. It has been documented in the class Materia medica that Acontium carmichaeli can play an essential role in regulating the endocrine system of the human body [58]. Zingiber officinale serves as the ministerial drug in SND, and its major pharmacological acting appears to be antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and digestive aid [59]. It was reported that the content of aconitum alkaloids in Acontium carmichaeli increased 36.40% when Acontium carmichaeli was used with Zingiber officinale [60], which may provide evidence to the speculation that Zingiber officinale plays an assistant role in strengthening the efficacy of Acontium carmichaeli. Glycyrrhiza uralensis, as a tonifying herbal medicine, serves as the adjunctive and messenger drug in SND. It is found that when Acontium carmichaeli and Glycyrrhiza uralensis are mixed in the form of a decoction, Glycyrrhiza uralensis can decrease the toxicity of Acontium carmichaeli and make the effect of invigoration last for an even longer time [57]. The combination of different types of medical herbs above in SND can benefit from each other with different roles in the formula, and ultimately gain the goal of enhancing efficacy and reducing toxicity, which quite caters to the core thinking of TCM theory. Our study demonstrated that SND had a time-related intervention effect on hypothyroidism, which may provide complementary insights into the conventional thyroid hormone replacement therapy on hypothyroidism. In summary, a metabonomic method based on UHPLC-Q-TOFMS was developed to study the metabolic changes in hypothyroid rats and the intervention effect of TCM SND. Three typical rat models of hypothyroidism were applied to characterize the metabolic changes of hypothyroidism comprehensively. 17, 21 and 19 potential biomarkers were identified related to MMI-, PTU- and thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism, respectively, primarily involved in energy metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, purine metabolism and so on. Using the potential biomarkers found in this study as the criteria, we found that both SND and positive drug T4 had obvious recovery effects on hypothyroidism through reversing partial disturbed metabolic pathways. However, due to the small number of rats in this study, this pilot study is more like to demonstrate the methodology rather than to provide definitive conclusions about the disease and drug. Application of these traces in other species including humans and combination with other “omics” strategies to validate hypothyroidism-related metabolite changes and value the holistic efficacy of SND await further study. Our results show that the metabonomic platform gains the potential to shed new light on the hypothyroidism-related biomarkers and pathophysiology, and provides a complementally effective treatment on hypothyroidism with TCM SND.Materials and MethodsEthics Statement All animal experiments were approved by the Administrative Committee of Experimental Animal Care and Use of Second Military Medical University (SMMU, Licence No. 2011023), and conformed to the National Institute of Health guidelines on the ethical use of animals.Reagents and Materials Triiodothyronine radioimmunoassay kit and thyroxin radioimmunoassay kit were purchased from Beijing North Institute of Biological Technology (Beijing, China). HPLC-grade methanol and acetonitril (ACN) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Formic acid was obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Ammonium formate, PTU, MMI, ketamine hydrochloride, xylazine, acepromazine, ketorolac, gentamicin and standard kynurenic acid, homovanillic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine were purchased from Acros Organics (NewJersey, USA). Spermidine, creatine, creatinine, xanthurenic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, α-ketoglutaric acid, taurine, allantoin, uric acid, and hippuric acid were obtained from Shanghai Jingchun Reagent Co. Ultrapure water was prepared with a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Acontium carmichaeli (from Sichuan, China), Glycyrrhiza uralensis (from Xinjiang, China) and Zingiber officinale (from Guizhou, China) were purchased from Lei Yunshang Medicine Corp. (Shanghai, China). They were authenticated by Lianna Sun (Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China) and met the standards recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2010 Edition).Preparation of SND and phytochemical investigation According to the original composition of SND recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2010 edition, SND was prepared using the following procedure. The crude drugs of A. carmichaeli 90 g, Z.officinale 60 g and G. uralensis 90 g were immersed in 2.4 liter water for 1 h and then decocted to boil for 2 h. The decoction was filtered through four layers of gauze. Next, the dregs were boiled once again for 1 h with 1.9 liters of water and the decoction was filtrated out with the above method. Afterward, the successive decoctions were merged and condensed under decompression. Finally, the extraction solution was made to a concentration of 1.0 g crude drugs/mL. According to our previous published paper [61], 53 components of SND were identified. Parallel SND extraction experiment showed that RSD of typical components' peak area was less than 4%, indicating the reproducibility of SND extracts was good.Hypothyroidism models and Treatment The study was approved by the national legislation of China and local guidelines and performed at the Center of Laboratory Animals of the Second Military Medical University (Shanghai, China). 64 male Wistar rats (170±15 g) commercially obtained from the Slac Laboratory Animal Co., LTD (Shanghai, China) were maintained under standard laboratory conditions (temperature of 21–23°C, relative humidity 45–65%, and 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle) with aseptic food and tap water ad libitum. After one-week habituation, all animals were housed individually in metabolism cages and allowed to acclimatize for additional 24 h. The rats were randomly divided into eight groups (8 rats/group). A. antithyroid drug-induced hypothyroid groups consisted of three groups: (1) the control group, which were treated with normal tap water for 4 weeks, (2) MMI-induced hypothyroid group (MMI group), which received 0.04% MMI (wt/vol) in the drinking water for 4 weeks as previous study described [62], (3) PTU-induced hypothyroid group (PTU group), which received 0.05% PTU (wt/vol) in the drinking water for 4 weeks as described by Srikanta Jena et al [63]. The dose of antithyroid drugs (MMI and PTU) was adjusted according to water intake and body weight every 3 days throughout the experiment, as described before [64]. B: surgery-induced hypothyroid groups consisted of five groups: (4) Sham group and (5) Sham + SND group, which received false thyroidectomy and postoperative treatment; (6) thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroid group (Hypo group), (7) SND-treated thyroidectomized group (Hypo + SND group) and (8) T4-treated thyroidectomized group (Hypo + T4 group), which had the thyroid gland removed and postoperative treatment. The thyroidectomy was done in rats anesthetized with ketamine (10 mg/kg, intramuscular; i.m.) and xylazine (5 mg/kg, i.m.), as previously described [65]. Briefly, a midline skin incision was made along the length of the neck. The underlying tissues were cleared and the salivary glands were retracted laterally. The two halves of the sternohyoid muscle were separated and retracted laterally. Thyroid muscle was separated from the thyroid gland lobes and retracted along with the sternohyoid muscle. A midline cut was made in the isthmus and the thyroid glands were excised bilaterally. Extreme care was taken so as not to damage the laryngeal nerve. Sham rats underwent a surgical procedure in which the rats were anesthetized, the trachea was exposed and the incision was closed, simulating thyroidectomy. After surgery, ketorolac (50 mg/kg, i.m.) and gentamicin (10 mg/kg) were administered over 5 days to alleviate pain and prevent infection. Rats were monitored closely for at least 1 week after the surgery for complications and animals were used for treatment 4 weeks later. During the phase of treatment, animals in the Sham + SND group and Hypo + SND group received SND by oral gavage at a daily dose of 10 g/kg body weight (equal to 10 mL/kg body weight) for the following 4 weeks. Animals in Hypo + T4 group were administered levothyroxin 20 ug/kg/day i.p. for 4 weeks according to previous study [65]. And animals in the Sham and Hypo groups were administered with saline for 4 consecutive weeks.Sample collection and preparation Throughout the animal study, all 64 rats were weighted twice a week to monitor the progress of hypothyroidism and evaluate the effectiveness of SND on hypothyroidism. The rectal temperature, food intake and water intake were recorded before and after hypothyroidism model established in control, MMI and PTU groups, and these three physical variables were measured in surgical groups before surgery, 4 weeks after surgery and 4 weeks after treatment. The blood was collected from the suborbital vein before the hypothyroidism model established, at the end of hypothyroidism model established and at the end of treatment. Serum biochemical parameters including total triiodothyronine (T3) and total thyroxin (T4) were determined by radioimmunoassay. Samples of 24-h urine were collected before the hypothyroidism model established, at the end of hypothyroidism model established in all animals and at the designed time intervals during treatment: at week 2, 3 and 4 after treatment in the surgical groups. Sodium azide was added to the collection vessels as an antibacterial agent. After centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C to remove particle contaminants, the supernatants were immediately stored in aliquots at −80°C before UHPLC-Q-TOFMS analysis. The urine samples were thawed at room temperature prior to analysis. To reduce the effect of the solvent and get a good peak shape, 100 uL urine sample was diluted with 400 µL acetonitrile and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min at 4°C [35]. The clear supernatant was transferred to an autosampler vial and kept at 4°C. A 4 uL aliquot was made onto the column in each run. An in-house quality control (QC) was prepared by pooling and mixing the same volume of each sample. The QC sample was run prior to the start of the analytical run for six times to “condition” the system and analyzed after every 8 samples to check for system stability [34]. Seven parallel samples obtained from a random urine sample were extracted by the same extraction method and injected continuously to evaluate repeatability of method.UHPLC-MS analysis UHPLC-MS analysis was performed on Agilent 1290 Infinity LC system coupled to Agilent 6530 Accurate-Mass Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer (Agilent, USA). Chromatographic separations were performed on an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.8 µm, Waters, Milford, Ireland) maintained at 45°C. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid (A) and ACN modified with 0.1% formic acid (B). The following gradient program was used: 0%B at 0–2 min, 0%–15% B at 2–10 min, 15%–30% B at 10–14 min, 30%–95% B at 14–17 min, 95% B at 17–19 min, 95%-0%B at 19–20 min and followed by re-equilibrated step of 4 min. The flow rate was 400 ml/min and the injection volume was 4 µl. Mass spectrometry was performed on an Agilent 6530 Accurate-Mass Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer (Agilent, USA), operating in both positive and negative ion modes. The capillary voltage was 3.5 kV, drying gas flow was 11 L/min, and the gas temperature was 350°C. The nebulizer pressure was set at 45 psig. The fragmentor voltage was set at 120 V and skimmer voltage was set at 60 V. All analyses were acquired using a mixture of 10 mM purine (m/z 121.0508) and 2 mM hexakis phosphazine (m/z 922.0097) as internal standards to ensure mass accuracy and reproducibility. Data were collected in a centroid mode and the mass range was set at m/z 50–1000 using extended dynamic range. MS/MS analysis was carried out to study the structure of potential biomarkers. MS spectra were collected at 2 spectra/s, and MS/MS spectra were collected at 0.5 spectra/s, with a medium isolation window (∼4 m/z) and the collision energy was 18 V.Data analysis First, raw data in the instrument specific format (.d) was converted to common data format (.mzdata) files by a conversion software program, in which the isotope interferences were excluded. The program XCMS (http://metlin.scripps.edu/download/) was applied for peak alignment of the data in the time domain and automatic integration and extraction of the peak intensities [66]. XCMS parameters were default settings except that the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) was set to 10 and the retention time window (BW) was set to 9. Metabolites that did not exist in 80% of the samples in either group were filtered [67]. The retention time and m/z data pair were exported to an Excel table (Microsoft). Before the multivariate data analysis, for each chromatogram, the intensity of each ion was normalized to the total ion intensity, in order to partially compensate for the concentration bias of metabolites between samples and to obtain the relative intensity of metabolites. The resulting normalized data were exported to SIMCA-P V12.0.0 Demo (Umetrics, Sweden) for partial least-squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) after mean-centering and pareto scaling. The quality of the model was evaluated by the cross-validation parameter Q2, R2Y. One-way ANOVA was performed to reveal the statistical differences in the significance of variation among Sham, Sham + SND, Hypo, Hypo + SND and Hypo + T4 groups. And the Tukey post hoc test was applied for comparisons of multiple groups. The differences were considered significant when p<0.05. To account for multiple hypothesis testing, the false discovery rate was estimated as the maximum q value in the set of significant differences for the metabonomic data set. False discovery rates were computed using the R package q value (http://www.r-project.org/). The significance of differences between the groups was evaluated by the p value for the fixed-effect parameter estimate of group differences.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Comparison of biomarkers and related pathways between MMI- and PTU-induced hypothyroidism models.

Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have a high prevalence of major depression and low levels of BDNF. We therefore explored whether the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with co-morbid depression and whether depression affects the serum levels of BDNF in a Han Chinese subjects with T2DM. A Total of 296 T2DM patients and 70 healthy volunteers (Health control, HC group) were recruited in this study. T2DM patients were divided into two subgroups: depressive diabetes group (DDM group, n = 64) and non-depressive diabetes group (NDDM group, n = 232), according to the presence or the absence of depression assessed by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Val66Met polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP). Serum BDNF levels were measured by ELISA kit. In this study, 21.6% (64/296) patients with T2DM had depression. The BDNF Val66Met genotype distributions were statistically different among the three groups (χ2 = 7.39, p < 0.05). DDM group carried the highest frequencies of Met allele (53.9%) compared to HC group (39.3%) and NDDM group (38.8%). Subjects with Met/Met had lowest serum BDNF levels (76.59 ± 5.12 pg/ml, F = 7.39, p < 0.05) compared to subjects with Val/Met (79.04 ± 5.19 pg/ml) and Val/Val (83.83 ± 3.97 pg/ml). Within T2DM group, it was also observed that the serum BDNF levels in DDM group were significantly lower than those in NDDM group (76.67 ± 5.35 vs. 79.84 ± 3.97 pg/ml, p < 0.05). In type 2 diabetes subjects, BDNF serum levels were significant correlations with genotypes (r = −0.346, p < 0.01), depression scores (r = −0.486, p < 0.01) and HbA1c (r = −0.168, p < 0.05). After adjustment for gender, HbA1c, BMI and numbers of complications, BDNF Val/Met genotype distributions (OR = 2.105, p < 0.05) and decreased serum BDNF levels (OR = 0.835, p < 0.01) were independently associated with depression in T2DM. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism might be implicated in the pathogenesis of depression in T2DM by decreasing serum BDNF levels in Han Chinese Subjects.

The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism might be implicated in the pathogenesis of depression in T2DM by decreasing serum BDNF levels in Han Chinese Subjects. Introduction Depression and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are two of the most prevalent and devastating diseases. There is a strong association between T2DM and depression [1,2]. Epidemiological data indicates that approximately 26-30% of diabetic patients suffer from differential severity of depression, excessive above that of the normal population [3,4]. Moreover, the mortality rate is significantly higher among patients with T2DM and depression than among patients with diabetes without depression [5]. Therefore, it is important to study the etiology of depression with T2DM. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurothophic factor family, which plays a key role in regulating survival, growth and maintenance of neurons [6]. It has been suggested that reduction in BDNF expression is a pathogenic factor common to Alzheimer’s disease and major depression [7,8]. For example, a study by Karege et al. have reported that major depressive patients exhibited significantly lower levels of serum BDNF compared with normal controls [9,10], whereas the use of antidepressants led to an up regulation of BDNF in the hippocampus of subjects with major depression [8]. The association between BDNF and depression is also supported by animal studies in which infusion of recombinant BDNF exerted antidepressant effect [11]. The human BDNF gene has been mapped to chromosome 11p13 and a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) consisting of a missense change (G196A), which produces a valine (Val) to methionine (Met) change, has been identified in the coding exon of the BDNF gene at position 66 (Val66Met) [12]. The Val66Met polymorphism in the BDNF gene has been shown to impact intracellular trafficking and activity-dependent secretion of BDNF [13]. Clinical studies demonstrate that the Met allele is associated with decreased hippocampal volume in both normal and depressed patients and with decreased executive function and cognition [13,14] Hong et al. first reported that BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was associated with major depressive disorders in a Caucasian population [15]. Subsequently, increasing clinical studies have confirmed that the Met allele was more commonly found among individuals with mood disorders [16-18]. In line with these clinical findings, animal study showed that a variant BDNF mouse (BDNF Met/Met) reproduced the phenotypic hallmarks of humans with this variant allele, and exhibited increased anxiety-related behaviors [19]. Paradoxically, Tsai SJ et al. reported a higher incidence of depression in Val, not Met carriers [20]. Currently, it is still unclear what the consequences of the Val66Met polymorphism are on the brain function, as both alleles have been associated with different disease processes, including emotion response [21], esoghageal hypersensitivity [22], individual's sexual activities [23] and depression [15,24,25]. Of interest, several studies have shown that the degree of therapeutic response to antidepressants is associated with the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, suggesting that BDNF gene may be a good candidate gene for the pharmacogenetic study of antidepressants [7]. Furthermore, a decrease in BDNF concentration has been strongly linked to T2DM. BDNF was reported to improve glucose metabolism insulin sensitivity, and reduce food consumption [26]. The direct role of BDNF in metabolism is supported by studies on BDNF-deficient mice, which developed diabetes and obesity in early adulthood [27]. Animals studies have also shown that BDNF has important effects on the regulation of eating behavior [28] and modulation of the secretion and activities of insulin, leptin, ghrelin and pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with energy homeostasis[29]. These findings suggest that BDNF may also play a pathogenic role in the development of obesity and T2DM in humans. More recent epidemiologic studies [30] showing T2DM patients develop more depression and at the same time have lower serum BDNF levels compared to non-diabetic individuals [28,31,32], posed an interesting question whether the higher rate of depression in diabetes may be in part mediated by decreased BDNF levels. However, the clinical significance of the effect of BDNF levels on depression and the impact of Val66Met polymorphism remain unclear in T2DM patients with depression. Thus, BDNF genetic studies of patients with and without depression may shed light on the potential genetic link between depression and T2DM. We therefore hypothesized that a genetic variation (Val to Met substitution) in BDNF leading to a reduction in serum BDNF levels in T2DM may contribute to depression and diabetes. In this study, we investigated whether the Val66Met polymorphism and serum BDNF levels are different in Han Chinese subjects who suffered from T2DM with or without depression.Subjects and MethodsParticipants All subjects were of Chinese origin (Han Chinese) and lived in the same region at the time of the study. A total of 296 T2DM patients from Metabolic Disease Hospital of Tianjin Medical University were recruited into this study. T2DM was diagnosed according to the 1999 WHO criteria. In the ethnicity, age and gender-matched control group, 70 healthy people without mental illness, family history of psychiatric disorders and T2DM were recruited from the same area. All T2DM subjects were divided into two subgroups: depressive group (DDM group, n = 64) and non-depressive group (NDDM group, n = 232), depending on presence or absence of depression. This study was approved by the local ethics committee review board and was conducted using Good Clinical Practice in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects gave written informed consent before entering the study.Depression assessment The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) Chinese edition [33] was used to assess depressive symptoms. This scale is the most widely used depression screening scale. The Chinese version of the CES-D scale shows good reliability and validity across all ages in urban and rural population [34]. This scale consists of 16 negative affect and 4 positive affect items, such as "I felt depressed", "I felt lonely", and "I was happy". Participants were asked about the number of days on which they experienced depressive symptoms during the previous week. Each item was accompanied by a standard four-point Likert scale of potential responses: 1 = none, 2 = one or two days a week, 3 = three or four days per week, and 4 = five days or more per week. Higher scores on the CES-D indicate more depressive symptoms. In the scale, four items that describe positive effects were reversed before conducting our analysis. Radloff has suggested that a score of 16 should be the cut-off point for the scale [35], while other studies have adopted 21 or 22 as the cut-off point [36]. Given the complexity of the cutoff point selection, this study used CES-D scale combined with another scale named Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [37] to assess to be depressed together. Participants rated the frequency of experiencing nine symptoms during the previous two weeks: 0) not at all, 1) on several days, 2) on more than half of the days, and 3) nearly every day. The PHQ-9 scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating high severity of symptoms. The CES-D scale score cut-off point was set to 16, and the PHQ-9 scale was set to 5. The recruited subjects were asked to complete the 2 questionnaires by themselves at different days. Subjects meeting the criteria of both scales were defined as depression.BDNF polymorphism analyses Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral whole blood of subjects by proteinase K digestion. BDNF-Val66Met polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). DNA fragments of interest were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primers 5'-ACTCTGGAGAGCGTGAAT-3' and 5'-ATACTGTCACACACGCTC-3' designed by Oligo 6.0 primer analysis software. A total volume of 25 μl PCR reaction contains 2 μl of genomic DNA, 2.5 μl of 10 × PCR buffer, 2 μl of dNTP, 1 μl of each primer, 16.2 μl of distilled water and 0.3 μl of Taq polymerase. The PCR conditions were as follows: predegeneration at 94°C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 30s at 94°C, annealing at 55°C for 30s and extending at 72°C for 1 min. The thermal cycle was completed with 72°C for 10 min. The Val66Met polymorphism was differentiated with the NlaIII restriction enzyme and the product was electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide and visualized on a UV trans-illuminator.Measurement of serum BDNF, glycosylated haemoglobin A1c, blood urea nitrogen, Cr: creatinine, UMA:urine micro- albumin Blood samples were drawn into glass tubes without anticoagulants, which were immediately spun at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Serum was isolated and stored at −20°C. The serum BDNF levels were measured by commercial ELISA kit (Adlitteram diagnostic laboratories, USA). After thawing, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C for complete platelet removal. All samples and standards were measured in duplicate, and the coefficient of variation was less than 5%. Plasma levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Cr: creatinine (Cr) and urine micro- albumin (UMA) were measured using routine laboratory methods. Plasma glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were measured using High-performance liquid chromatography (HA-8160).Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS Windows version 18.0. Genotype and allele frequency distributions were compared using the χ2 test. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was computed to the expected genotype distributions. Data was expressed as mean ± SD. The means for variables between the two groups were compared by a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. Statistics among the three groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc individual comparisons with the SNK test and chi-square analysis for categorical variables. The associations of BDNF polymorphism and serum levels with the relevant clinical parameters and depression scale scores were analyzed by Pearson correlation and multiple step logistic regression. In both Pearson correlation and multiple step logistic regression, Met/Met + Met/Val were delegated by 1 and Val/Val was delegated by 2. All reported p values were two-tailed, and p values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsParticipants and clinical characteristics in DDM group In this study, we totally recruited 296 T2DM Han Chinese patients and 70 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects (mean age: 53.2 ± 5.5 vs. 55.2 ± 6.5 years, gender ratio: M/F 34/36 vs. 148/148) with the same ethnicity. Within the T2DM group, 64 patients (21.6%) had depression with 19 (12.8%) males and 45 (30.4%) females. In addition to a higher female/male ratio, the DDM group had higher HbA1c, BMI, educational levels and with more diabetic complications than the NDDM group (Table 1). There were no statistical differences in age, duration and marital status between the DDM group and the NDDM group (data not shown).Table 1 Characteristics of NDDM and DDM groupVariablesNDDM groupDDM groupp value (n = 232)(n = 64) Gender(M/F)129/10319/45p < 0.001Age (year)53.1 ± 4.954.3 ± 5.7p = 0.337Education Level (%)   ≤Primary school35(15.1%)9(14.1%)p = 1.000Junior middle school144(62.1%)34(53.1%)p = 0.199Senior middle school38(16.4%)9(14.1%)p = 0.847Disease duration (year)5.2 ± 1.36.2 ± 0.9p = 0.234The number of complications (n)2.6 ± 0.85.1 ± 1.2p = 0.004BMI (kg/m2)25.9 ± 3.828.3 ± 4.3p = 0.017HbA1c(%)8.02 ± 1.888.91 ± 1.84p < 0.001 Data expressed as mean ± S.D. or frequency [n (%)], BMI: body mass index; HbA1c: glycosylated haemoglobin A1c, p value < 0.05 for statistical significance.Association of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism with type 2 diabetes and depression To assess whether BDNF Val66Met polymorphism contributed to depression in T2DM, 70 healthy subjects, 64 T2DM with depression and 232 T2DM without depression were genotyped. The genotype distributions of BDNF Val66Met followed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among the groups, were summarized in Table 2. The genotype distributions and allele frequencies of BDNF Val66Met were summarized in Table 3. Our study indicated that BDNF Val66Met polymorphism had no association with T2DM. However, within the T2DM group, there were statistical differences in genotype distributions and allele frequencies between the NDDM group vs. DDM group, p < 0.05. The DDM group carried higher frequencies of Met allele (53.9%, p < 0.05) compared to NDDM group (38.8%).Table 2 Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of BDNF Val66MetGroupnA (T)χ2pVal/ ValVal/MetMet/Met  HC7026(25.8)33(33.4)11(16.6)0.90p > 0.05NDDM23288(86.9)108(110.7)36(34.9)0.05p > 0.05DDM6415(13.6)29(31.8)20(18.6)0.23p > 0.05 A is the actual number of genotypes; T is the expected number of genotypes.

Our study revealed that there were significantly genotype-related differences in serum BDNF levels among 3 groups (F = 7.39, p < 0.05, Table 4). Interestingly, Val/Val carriers had the highest serum BDNF levels and Met/Met carriers had the lowest serum BBNF levels.Table 4 Serum BDNF levels in three genotypesGenotypenSerum BDNF level(pg/ml)Fp valueVal/ Val group12983.83 ± 3.97F = 7.39p < 0.05Val/Met group17079.04 ± 5.19*Met/Met group6776.59 ± 5.12*#   Data expressed as mean ± S.D., p value < 0.05 criteria for statistical significance. *p < 0.05 vs. Val/Val group, # p < 0.05 vs. Val/Met group.Association of serum BDNF levels in patients with T2DM and depression There were significant differences in serum BDNF levels in HC, NDDM and DDM groups (F = 24.94, p < 0.01, Table 5).

Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis showed that when BDNF serum levels were tested for simple linear correlations against genotypes, depression scores, gender, BMI, HbA1c, BUN, Cr and numbers of complications, significant inverse correlations were found with genotypes (r = −0.346, p < 0.01), depression scores (r = −0.416, p < 0.01) and HbA1c (r = −0.168, p < 0.05), indicating that low BDNF concentrations may be a pathogenic factor associated with both depression and T2DM. Furthermore, after adjustment the presence or absence risk factors for depression including gender, HbA1c, BMI , BUN(μmol/l), Cr(μmol/l) and numbers of complications, BDNF Val/Met genotype distributions (OR = 2.105, p < 0.05) and decreased serum levels of BDNF (OR = 0.835, p < 0.01) were also independently associated with depression in T2DM (Table 6).Table 6 Analysis of risk factors for depression in type 2 diabetes patients BS.E.WaldPExp(B)95%C.I.forExp(B)(OR)LowerUpperFemale1.0350.29412.4120.0002.8151.5835.008Education level (n)0.2740.1682.6670.1021.3160.9471.829HbA1c(%)1.7920.2194.2510.0411.8851.7092.987BMI(kg/m2)−0.0620.0382.4630.1170.9420.8741.015SBP(mmHg)0.0060.0110.2630.6081.0060.9841.028DBP(mmHg)0.0010.0191.0060.9381.0020.9641.040UMA(μmol/l)0.0020.0030.3680.5441.0170.9961.007BUN(μmol/l)0.2810.0939.2040.0021.3241.0151.558Cr(μmol/l)0.0270.00810.6790.0011.3730.9581.989Number of complications(n)2.5130.5342.4860.0241.0940.9071.142Val → Met3.1141.27210.4340.0352.1051.2824.991BDNF(pg/ml)−1.1810.0647.8560.0050.8350.7360.947 These variables were tested by multiple step logistic regression analysis.

Our results show that, for Chinese subjects, there is a positive association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and comorbid depression in T2DM patients and Met allele carriers are susceptible to suffer from depression. Our data also show that the serum BDNF levels are decreased in T2DM patients carrying either 66Met/Met homozygote or 66Val/Met heterozygote compared to those carrying 66Val homozygote. We also found a significant inverse association between BDNF levels and HbA1c. The functional Val66Met polymorphism of BDNF has been studied for its possible associations with depression, but reports were contradictory. Hong et al. first reported that BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was associated with major depression disorders in a Caucasian population [13,15]. Subsequently, increasing clinical studies have confirmed that the Met allele was found more often among individuals with mood disorders [16-18]. Paradoxically, Tsai SJ et al. reported a higher incidence of depression in Val, not Met carriers [20]. In contrast, the meta-anlysis done by Verhagen et al. did not detect any significant genetic association between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and major depression disorders [38]. Differences between our study and previous study findings of an association between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and depression may be due to ethnic variances and alternative definitions for depression. In this study, we were among the first to identify that there is no association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and T2DM in Chinese subjects. Yet, we have demonstrated a significant association between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and depression within the T2DM group. We found that DDM group carried a higher frequency of Met allele (53.9%). After adjustment for age, gender, BMI and HbA1c, BDNF Val/Met genotypes were still independently correlated with depression scores (OR = 1.952, p < 0.05). Our study provides further evidence that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms may be a good therapeutic candidate gene for T2DM patients with depression in Chinese subjects. The prevalence of depression is increasing at a significantly greater rate in patients with T2DM as compared with people without diabetes [39]. How could the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism influence depression in the T2DM subjects? Probable explanation is that the Val66Met polymorphism in the BDNF gene has been shown to impact secretion of BDNF [13]. A number of studies have suggested that the Met allele is associated with poorer episodic memory performance, a symptom often observed in subjects with MDD. Furthermore, it has been shown that the Met allele is associated with reduced hippocampal activity [13]. Studies in animal models have shown that the presence of the Met allele alters the sorting and secretion of proBDNF, such that less regulated secretion is likely to occur in carriers of at least one Met allele [40]. In this study, the serum BDNF levels are significantly lower in T2DM patients carrying either 66Met homozygote or 66Val/Met heterozygote compared with that carrying 66Val homozygote, indicating that this homozygosity for the 66Met allele confers an increased risk for depression in T2DM patients through mechanism involving reduced BDNF production and secretion. The study by Ribeiro et al. has also shown that Val66Met variants were associated with depression, presuming that the variants might affect the genesis and secretion of BDNF [13,15]. Moreover, Krabbe et al. discovered that the lower level of BDNF accompanied T2DM established a negative correlation between BDNF levels and fasting blood glucose. In other words, as fasting blood glucose progressively increased, the output of BDNF from the brain is progressively decreased. Collectively, the decreased BDNF may be a pathogenetic factor involved not only in depression, but also in T2DM [32]. In this study, we also found that BDNF serum levels were inversely correlated with HbA1c as a reflection of the average level of blood glucose over the previous 3 months. Therefore, we suggest that the decreased levels of BDNF can not be solely ascribed to Val66Met variants and the influence of elevated glucose level should also be considered. Regarding other potential factors involved in T2DM with depression, we also found that HbA1c, BUN, Cr and the number of complications were independent risk factors for comorbid depression in T2DM patients, confirming that diabetes and depression interacted with each other [1]. First, depression may have resulted from the biologic stress of living with diabetes. This is because the biochemical changes associated with diabetes such as stress, inflammation, hyperglycemia and activations of the hypotha-lamic pituitary adrenal axis which induce arousal of the nervous system and may lead to the development of depression [39]. Moreover, depression may also results from the burden of living with T2DM such as poor diet, physical inactivity and taking insulin or from the psychological stress while coping with diabetes [41,42]. Furthermore, poor glycemic control is associated with elevated plasma concentrations cortisol and greater sensitivity to stress, possibly leading to concurrent diabetes and depression. Poor glycemic control may also adversely affects mood, and further aggravates depression. On the other hand, depression also contributes to the development of diabetes. Prospective studies have observed that many unhealthy lifestyles occur in patients with depression, such as binge eating and lack of exercise, which also increase diabetes risk [43]. Depression induces increased production of corticosteroids and catecholamine by affecting neuroendocrine system, especially the function of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and central nerve, which, in turn, influence blood glucose indirectly [44]. Taken together, these studies provide some evidences to support the strong association between T2DM and depression. There are two other issues noted in our study that might contribute to the development of depression in T2DM. First is the gender difference in the prevalence of depression occuring in 30.4% in women and 12.8% in men, in line with the findings from a previous study [45]. Interactions between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and environments may differ between men and women. Although the amount of life events men and women experience is rather similar, several studies have indicated that women subjectively experience more stress and have an increased stress response even they have the same BDNF Val66Met polymorphism [46]. The gender-related influence of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism in depression may be due to sexual dimorphism in brain structures involved in the neurobiology of depression, particularly, the hippocampus. Male and female hippocampi have been documented to differ significantly in their anatomical structure, their neurochemical make-up and their reactivity to stressful situations [47]. The second is that education levels are related to depression. Consistent with our study, Abolfotouh el al suggested that lower education levels are associated with an increased incidence of depression [48].Whereas other studies provided evidence that the higher educated people are more likely to develop depression [49]. In conclusion, our current study demonstrated that the presence of the functional BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was associated with depression in T2DM by decreasing the serum BDNF levels, suggesting that increased BDNF levels may be a therapeutic potential in depression patients with T2DM. Limitations of the present study are that our sample was not large for a genetic polymorphism, and we did not perform any interventions on our patients. A large primary study will be necessary to confirm our study and validate the therapeutic response in the depression with T2DM patients who carry Met allele.Competing interests The authors have declared that they have no conflicts of interests.Authors' contributions Chen LM and Zhou JX conceived the study, analyzed data and wrote the manuscript.

In the Hoorn Prevention Study we aimed to assess the effectiveness of a primary care based lifestyle intervention to reduce the estimated risk of developing T2DM and for CVD mortality, and to motivate changes in lifestyle behaviors. The Hoorn Prevention Study is a parallel group randomized controlled trial, implemented in the region of West-Friesland, the Netherlands. 622 adults with ≥10% estimated risk of T2DM and/or CVD mortality were randomly assigned and monitored over a period of 12 months. The intervention group (n=314) received a theory-based lifestyle intervention based on an innovative combination of and , provided by trained practice nurses in 12 general practices. The control group (n=308) received existing health brochures. Primary outcomes was the estimated diabetes risk according to the formula of the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) Study, and the estimated risk for CVD mortality according to the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) formula. Secondary outcomes included lifestyle behavior (diet, physical activity and smoking). The research assistants, the principal investigator and the general practitioners were blinded to group assignment. Linear and logistic regression analysis was applied to examine the between-group differences in each outcome measure, adjusted for baseline values. 536 (86.2%) of the 622 participants (age 43.5 years) completed the 6-month follow-up, and 502 (81.2%) completed the 12-month follow-up. The mean baseline T2DM risk was 18.9% (SD 8.2) and the mean CVD mortality risk was 3.8% (SD 3.0). The intervention group participated in a median of 2 sessions. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no significant differences in outcomes between the two groups at 6 or 12-months follow-up. The lifestyle intervention was not more effective than health brochures in reducing risk scores for T2DM and CVD or improving lifestyle behavior in an at-risk population.

Current Controlled Trials: Introduction Overweight, smoking, low levels of physical activity and an unhealthy diet are major risk factors for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [1-3]. The high prevalence of these risk factors has become a major public health problem. More and more public health policy-makers expect health care providers to identify at-risk groups and to provide effective interventions to reverse this trend. It has been well established that intensive lifestyle interventions can lower the incidence of T2DM in individuals with impaired glucose metabolism. However, the question remains as to whether the positive results observed in these highly controlled settings can be achieved in primary health care settings [4,5]. A translation of efficacious interventions to ‘real life’ settings in order to evaluate its effectiveness is not a realistic option, because both the available resources and training facilities in primary health care would be exceeded [6]. Barriers in translating intensive interventions to a ‘real life’ setting include lengthy diagnostic testing procedures to identify pre-diabetes, the cost of highly educated personnel to provide the intervention, the possible cost of incentives to motivate participants, and offering the intervention in locations such as single medical centers [7]. So far, randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of programs that target lifestyle behavior(s) to prevent T2DM or CVD in primary health care settings have had various different results, and if they were effective, the effects were small and unsustainable [8-13]. Nevertheless, a number of non-randomized and small randomized studies have shown promising results [14-16]. To further inform the guidance of clinical practice and health care delivery there is a need for pragmatic trials in which high risk individuals are taught to change, independent of research staff. Such trials must be matching the targeted individuals' preferences, abilities and environmental constraints [17,18]. To address the current gap in the literature we developed and implemented a lifestyle intervention for the primary prevention of T2DM and CVD, tailored to the available resources and infrastructure for national primary health care services in the Netherlands. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a theory-based lifestyle intervention on the estimated risk of developing T2DM and CVD mortality in adults at risk, compared to providing written information only. A further aim was to assess the effects of the intervention on actual lifestyle behavior (physical activity, dietary behavior and smoking).MethodsStudy design and participants The methods and theory underlying the Hoorn Prevention Study, a parallel randomized controlled trial, have been reported in detail elsewhere [19]. Between December 2007 and April, 2008, a total of 8,193 men and women, 30–50 years of age, were sent an invitation letter asking them to participate in a selective screening procedure. The choice for the age group of 30–50 years was motivated by estimates of Dutch diabetes incidence rates based on the number of newly diagnosed patients by the general practitioner (GP) in five GP records [20]. Those estimates clearly mark the age-period in which incidence-rates start to rise (i.e. from 30 years onwards). The target group was approached after the identification of date of birth and absence of diabetes or known CVD from the computerized databases of the participating general practices (n=12). All invited individuals were living in various municipalities in the semi-rural region of West-Friesland in the Netherlands. The invitation included a tape measure for the measurement of waist circumference according to detailed instructions. Of the 3,587 respondents (43.8%), 2,401 responded positively, 921 of whom were eligible with regard to the pre-set cut-off score of the self-administered waist-circumference (≥101 cm for men and ≥87 cm for women). The cut-off scores were set 1 cm under the standard obesity cut-off point in order to account for a slight imprecision that may occur during self-measurement. Of these eligible respondents, 772 visited the Diabetes Research Center for baseline measurements, gave written informed consent, and participated in the trial (Figure 1).Figure 1 Flow chart of the Hoorn Prevention Study. T2DM and CVD risk scores were estimated according to the formulae described in the diabetes risk formula of the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) Study [21] and the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) project, respectively [22]. For both scores, and for each participant, age was extrapolated to 60 years to address the problem of a high relative but low absolute risk in younger persons. This made it possible to identify a potentially high risk at the age of 60 [22]. All respondents with at least a 10.0% T2DM risk and/or CVD mortality risk and no known prevalent T2DM or CVD were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. Before randomization, we excluded 150 individuals, 140 of whom had a less than 10.0% risk, and 10 who had undiagnosed T2DM (Figure 1). The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, and all participants gave written informed consent.Randomization A randomization schedule was drawn up with a computerized random number generator. If more than one member of the same family participated, consecutive members of that family were randomized to the same group as the first member, to avoid contamination. To ensure concealment of the treatment allocation, an independent administrative assistant from the Diabetes Research Center, who had no information at all about the participants, performed the randomization. This was achieved by instructing the participants not to communicate about the intervention with their GP or the medical assistants.Intervention The lifestyle intervention was based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) [23] and the theory of self-regulation [24]. The intervention further built on the approach used in a study carried out by Welschen et al., who used similar intervention elements to change the lifestyle behavior of T2DM patients in order to decrease their CVD risk [25]. The intervention was provided by specifically trained practice nurses in the participating general practices. In six face-to-face 30-minute counseling sessions, followed by 3-monthly telephone sessions, motivational interviewing[26] (MI) and problem solving treatment[27] (PST) were used. The aim of MI was to strengthen the attitude and intention to change according to the TPB. An important method to achieve this was the focus on a discrepancy between the personal goals of the participants and their actual situation, as described in the theory of self-regulation. PST was used to support participants in finding solutions to overcome this discrepancy, to strengthen their perceived control, and to provide tools to overcome barriers that hinder changes in lifestyle behavior [27]. All practice nurses in the Hoorn Prevention Study received 18 hours of specific training from experienced psychologists prior to the intervention (12 hours of MI and 6 hours of PST). During the course of the study and the counseling sessions the practice nurses used a treatment manual developed by the project leader and the psychologists who provided the training. Practical coaching was provided halfway through the sessions, and consisted of one hour of individual coaching with feedback. A random selection of sessions per practice nurse, taped on a digital voice recorder, was used during the coaching. A peer supervision meeting was also arranged to provide ongoing feedback and to increase uniformity of the counseling style among the practice nurses.Control group Participants in the control group received existing brochures containing health guidelines regarding physical activity and a healthy diet, obtained from the Dutch Heart Foundation. Smokers received an additional brochure on how to stop smoking from the Dutch Anti-Smoking Foundation (STIVORO). Control participants did not receive further contact or counseling.Outcome measures The primary outcome measures were the estimated risk of developing T2DM and the estimated risk of CVD mortality. The 9-year risk of developing T2DM was estimated with the risk formula derived from data from the ARIC Study [21], based on ethnicity, parental history of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and height. The 10-year risk of CVD mortality was estimated with the formula developed by the SCORE project [22], which includes sex, smoking status, total cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure. Secondary outcome measures included: •self-reported physical activity expressed in terms of i) metabolic equivalent of task (MET)- minutes per day light, moderate and vigorous activity (for classifying physical activity by rate of energy expenditure, i.e., by intensity) [28], and ii) number and proportion of participants who met the national recommendations for physical activity (≥30 minutes moderate-intensity physical activity such as brisk walking, on at least five days of the week) [29]. Physical activity was measured with a validated questionnaire [30]. •fruit intake (pieces per day, and number and proportion of participants who met the national recommendation of at least 2 pieces of fruit per day) and vegetable intake (grams per day, and number and proportion of participants who met the national recommendation of at least 200 grams of vegetable consumption per day). This was assessed according to an extended and modified version of the 8-item Food Frequency Questionnaire [31]. •smoking behavior (smoking every day/occasionally/never smoked), assessed with validated questions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the assessment of smoking status [32]. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm without shoes using a wall-fixed stadiometer. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.5 kg, wearing light cloths and no shoes. The standard scales that were used (SECA; London, UK) were calibrated yearly. Waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest. Two measurements to the nearest 0.5 cm were recorded; if the difference between the measurements was greater than 1 cm, a third measurement was made and the mean of the two closest measurements was calculated. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured after 10 minutes of rest, in a seated position, with a Colin Press BP 8800p Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor (Colin Medical Technology Corporation, USA). Fasting plasma glucose was measured according to the enzymatic reference method with hexokinase, HbA1c determination was based on the turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay for haemolysed whole blood, and total and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were measured with the enzymatic colorimetric method. All laboratory tests were performed using the Cobas Integra system (Roche diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Data collection was done by medical assistants, who were unaware of the groups to which the participants were assigned.Sample size calculation For the sample size calculation we used data from a Dutch working population of overweight people (body mass index ≥25), in which the standard deviation (SD) of the ARIC score was 8.11 [33]. For a two-sided detection of a 5.0% between-group difference in ARIC risk score (i.e. representing a difference in waist circumference of 1.5 cm or a difference in systolic blood pressure of 4 mmHg), with an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 90.0% in the present study, 120 participants per group were needed. However, in order to perform stratified analyses, and to take loss to follow-up into account, more participants were needed (i.e. 300 per group).Data-entry In order to ensure a high level of data accuracy, 10.0% of the manually entered data was entered twice, and each second entry was checked against the first. A maximum discrepancy level of 1.5% was accepted.Statistical methods Descriptive statistics (means (SD), or median and interquartile ranges, as appropriate) were used to describe the study sample with regard to demographics, physical characteristics and baseline laboratory values. Linear and logistic regression analysis was applied to examine the between-group differences in each outcome measure, adjusted for baseline values. We examined effect modification by individual-level factors, including sex, age, level of education, and T2DM and CVD risk at baseline. Stratified analyses were performed for effect modifiers if their interaction term was considered to be significant (p<0.1 in this case). All primary analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle: participants were analyzed in the groups to which they were originally randomly assigned, regardless of whether or not they actually received the intervention. Only participants for whom data were available were included in the analyses. In the analyses of smoking behavior we only included data of those who reported being a smoker at baseline. Participants with a fasting glucose >7.0 mmol/L (confirmed with a second fasting blood sample) were referred to their GP and then excluded from consecutive measurements because of the anticipated extra medical attention they might receive. Women who became pregnant during follow-up were also excluded because of potential bias in weight and waist circumference measurements. A per-protocol analysis included participants in the intervention group who attended at least 4 counseling sessions. All analyses were performed in SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).Results Figure 1 presents the trial’s flow chart. 622 participants were randomly assigned to receive either the lifestyle intervention (n=314) or health brochures only (n=308). After 6 months, 536 participants (86.2%) attended the first follow-up measurement, 533 (85.7%) of whom provided complete data and could be included in the analysis. 502 participants (80.7%) attended the second follow-up measurement. A drop-out analysis showed no significant differences in baseline values of primary outcome measures between participants who completed the study and those who dropped out (T-test ARIC p=0.10 (95% CI −3.63 – 0.33); SCORE p=0.99 (95% CI −0.60 – 0.59)). The baseline characteristics of the participants in the two groups were similar (Table 1). The mean age at baseline was 43.5 years (SD 5.3) and 363 participants were female (58.4%). Of 22 participants from the control group and 27 from the intervention group we also included the partner, who we assigned to the same group as the first-included. At baseline, the mean estimated 9-year risk of developing T2DM was 18.9% (SD 8.2) and the mean estimated 10-year CVD mortality risk was 3.8% (SD 3.0). Participants in the intervention group received a median of 2 (interquartile range 1–3) face-to-face counseling sessions and a median of 2.3 (interquartile range 1–3) sessions by phone. The baseline and follow-up values and the differences between groups in risk scores and lifestyle behavior are shown in Table 2.Table 1 Baseline characteristics of randomized participants in the Hoorn Prevention Study Control group (n=308) No. (%)Intervention group (n=314) No. (%)Sex    Female185 (60.1)178 (56.7)Age (yrs), mean (SD)43.4 (5.5)43.6 (5.1)Level of education    ≤Primary103 (33.6)101 (32.5)  Secondary145 (47.1)141 (44.9)  College, university59 (19.2)69 (22.0)Family history of diabetes77 (25.0)94 (29.9)Anthropometrics, mean (SD)    Body weight (kg)90.7 (15.4)90.2 (15.5)  Waist circumference (cm)96.7 (9.7)96.7 (9.8)Blood pressure    Systolic (mmHg)129.3 (13.3)128.7 (13.2)  Diastolic (mmHg)73.8 (9.0)73.0 (9.9)Table 2 Baseline and follow-up values and group differences in risk scores and lifestyle behavior (95% CI), adjusted for baseline Control groupIntervention groupGroup differences BaselineFollow-up 1 (6 months)Follow-up 2 (12 months)BaselineFollow-up 1 (6 months)Follow-up 2 (12 months)β of between group difference Follow-up 1β of between group difference Follow-up 2Risk scores          ARIC18.8 (8.5)18.0 (7.6)17.8 (9.2)19.0 (7.8)18.8 (8.5)18.5 (8.3)0.4 (−0.3 to 1.0)0.3 (−0.6 to 1.2)  SCORE3.8 (2.9)3.7 (3.0)3.7 (4.6)4.0 (3.0)4.0 (3.0)4.0 (3.0)0.0 (−0.3 to 0.2)−0.2 (−0.7 to 0.4)Physical activity          light activitiesa270 (150;371)296 (150;399)261 (137;364)283 (163;392)274 (171;393)266 (171;378)−13.3 (−36.6 to 10.1)7.2 (−14.5 to 28.8)  moderate  activitiesa47 (19;120)47 (19;121)56 (26;126)56 (19;150)47 (21;120)52 (21;138)−9.5 (−22.3 to 3.2)−9.4 (−22.0 to 3.2)  vigorous activitiesa0 (0;17)6 (0;17)0 (0;17)0 (0;17)0 (0;17)0 (0;17)−0.8 (−3.3 to 1.8)−0.1 (−3.3 to 3.1)  meeting recommendations n (%)b184 (59.7)167 (54.2)160 (51.9)201 (64.0)161 (51.3)162 (51.6)OR 0.7 (0.5 to 1.1)OR 0.9 (0.6 to 1.4)Dietary behaviors          pieces of fruit per day1.1 (0.8)1.3 (1.0)1.2 (0.9)1.1 (0.9)1.1 (0.9)1.1 (0.9)−0.2 (−0.3 to 0.0)−0.1 (−0.2 to 0.0)  meeting recommendations fruit   intake n (%)c67 (21.8)70 (22.7)68 (22.1)63 (20.1)57 (18.2)58 (18.5)OR 1.6 (0.9 to 2.6)OR 1.4 (0.9 to 2.4)  vegetable intake (grams per day)150 (70.4)151 (68.5)157 (89.9)148 (69.5)161 (126.6)156 (74.6)9.2 (−7.3 to 25.7)−0.4 (−12.7 to 11.9)  meeting recommendations veg.   intake n (%)d63 (20.5)57 (18.5)56 (18.2)72 (22.9)55 (17.5)62 (19.7)OR 1.1 (0.7 to 1.7)OR 0.9 (0.6 to 1.5)Smoking behavior          smokers n (%)54 (17.6)46 (17.2)43 (17.0)74 (23.9)53 (20.0)46 (18.3)OR 0.5 (0.2 to 1.9)OR 1.1 (0.4 to 3.1) Data are mean (standard deviation) unless otherwise specified.

We found no significant difference between the groups with regard to changes in physical activity, vegetable intake or smoking behavior over the 6 and 12 month follow-up period.Secondary analyses (per protocol, sub-group) Per protocol analyses (n=360) did not affect the findings described above. Stratified analyses revealed that participants with a lower level of education in the control group were responsible for the increase in fruit intake. In this sub-group analysis the control group (n=308) consumed, on average, a fourth of a piece of fruit per day more than the intervention group (n=53) after 6 and 12 months. Stratified analyses of groups separated by the mean baseline ARIC or mean SCORE risk showed no change in the results.Discussion In the current study we evaluated the effectiveness of an innovative, theory-based lifestyle intervention carried out in a primary health care setting. To our knowledge, we are the first to report on the effects of a lifestyle intervention to reduce the estimated risk of developing T2DM and CVD mortality. The cognitive behavior program was provided in the participants’ own general practice, by practice nurses instead of researchers in the study. At the same time, we were able to monitor the intervention carefully by providing standardized training for the nurse practitioners and feedback on the counseling sessions by means of tape recordings. In contrast to the procedure in former lifestyle interventions [4,5], the participants in our study were encouraged to find solutions instead of being told how to change their behavior, and they were also taught how to implement these solutions into their life. However, our findings show that the lifestyle intervention was not more effective than the provision of health brochures. Implementing lifestyle interventions in everyday practice poses challenging issues that require further investigation. A special focus in this regard may be the controllability of the dose of intervention in real-life settings, as this will probably be lower as compared to highly controlled settings. In addition, the role of participants’ social and physical environment may be of greater importance [34]. Earlier research in controlled settings has demonstrated that, separately, MI and PST are more effective than attention alone [35,36], and there is evidence to support the efficacy of MI in a number of programs promoting change in lifestyle behavior [36]. Although it has been convincingly demonstrated that T2DM can be delayed or prevented in high risk individuals, it is still a considerable challenge to provide evidence-based lifestyle programs for high risk populations in ‘real life’ settings. Few earlier randomized trials evaluated the effectiveness of diabetes prevention. These studies were, in line with our findings, not able to reproduce the very positive outcomes of previous efficacy trials [13,14]. Most diabetes prevention studies that were carried out in primary care had insufficient power, used single-group designs, and/or had high rates of attrition, and should therefore be interpreted with caution [37,38]. In the Hoorn Prevention Study we had sufficient power, randomization was performed at individual level, and relatively few participants were lost to follow-up. Other strengths include an appropriate design, choice of staff, staff training, adequate sample size and the choice for simple outcome measures. In addition, the participants did not receive financial incentives, and were recruited from the general population. Whereas the latter two arguments may be considered as strengths of the present study, they may also be associated with the lack of effectiveness of the intervention. The findings of our process-evaluation indicate that the recruitment strategy was adequate and resulted in a reasonably high reach of the target population [39]. Practice nurses were competent and confident to provide MI and PST, and participant satisfaction was high. Nevertheless, the amount of attended sessions was low, and almost no effects on determinants of behavioral change were seen [39]. The rather low attendance rate may have contributed to the absence of an intervention effect, since a median number of 2 counseling sessions were attended. On the other hand, after per protocol analyses (which only included participants who had attended at least 4 counseling sessions) no change in the results were seen. Six or less face-to-face sessions as we provided may not have been enough to induce a sustainable lifestyle behavioral change, given that previous efficacious lifestyle interventions provided at least 12 sessions [40-42]. However, since the participants in our effectiveness study were not even motivated enough to attend 6 sessions, it is unlikely that they would be willing to attend more. It must also be mentioned that participants in our study were, on average, younger, and had a lower absolute risk of developing T2DM than those enrolled in previous effectiveness studies on lifestyle interventions. With regard to the external validity we like to point out that the study sample was not culturally diverse. Although our population (predominantly from a Western European culture) was representative for the study region in the Netherlands, this may affect the generalizability of findings. Efforts were made to reduce barriers for participation to a minimum, as non-respondents are a potential threat to the external validity of the results [43]. We chose to approach potential participants via correspondence at multiple moments, as described by Dillman et al. [44]. Other efforts to reduce non-participation included the choice to provide the intervention in general practices (which are near to the homes of the participants), as well as to minimize the burden of the measurements by using short questionnaires, and to refrain from using unpleasant measurement methods such as 2-hour oral glucose tolerance tests. After 6 and 12 months the lifestyle intervention was not more effective than the provision of health brochures in improving estimated risk scores for T2DM and CVD or lifestyle behavior in an at-risk population. Hence we conclude that the provision of this primary prevention approach was not effective in a Dutch ‘real life’ primary care setting.Abbreviations ARIC: Atherosclerosis risk in communities; CVD: Cardiovascular disease; MI: Motivational interviewing; PST: Problem solving treatment; SCORE: Systematic coronary risk evaluation; T2DM: Type 2 diabetes.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors’ contributions JL, SDMB, MJMC, MWvT, JMD and GN were involved in the conception and design of the study.

Based on data obtained from genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screenings, domain mapping studies, intracellular co-localization approaches as well as reporter transcription assay measurements, we show here that the C-terminus of human PIM-1 kinase isoform2 (amino acid residues 135–313), a serine/threonine kinase of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated kinase family, directly interacts with VDR through the receptor’s DNA-binding domain. We further demonstrate that PIM-1 modulates calcitriol signaling in HaCaT keratinocytes by enhancing both endogenous calcitriol response gene transcription (osteopontin) and an extrachromosomal DR3 reporter response. These results, taken together with previous reports of involvement of kinase pathways in VDR transactivation, underscore the biological relevance of this novel protein-protein interaction.	The vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) is responsible for mediating the pleiotropic and, in part, cell-type-specific effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) on the cardiovascular and the muscle system, on the bone development and maintenance, mineral homeostasis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, vitamin D metabolism, and immune response modulation.

These results, taken together with previous reports of involvement of kinase pathways in VDR transactivation, underscore the biological relevance of this novel protein-protein interaction. Background Genomic control of primary calcitriol-responsive genes is primarily achieved by binding of (phosphorylated) vitamin D receptor (VDR)-retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers in a non-symmetrical head to tail arrangement to vitamin D response elements (VDRE) located within the promotor regions of target genes [1]. Corepressor proteins such as hairless, Alien, NCoR (nuclear receptor corepressor) or SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoic acid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor) link non-liganded DNA-bound VDR or antagonist-destabilized nuclear hormone receptor (NHR)-coactivator complexes to enzymes with histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and as a result promote condensation of chromatin to repress basal transcription [2,3]. The binding of calcitriol or one of its agonists triggers the release of corepressors, accompanied by subsequent recruitment of coactivators of the p160 family and finally of more general cofactors such as CBP/p300 to mediate local chromatin remodeling and stable assembly of the basal transcriptional machinery [1]. Secondly, calcitriol can also mediate ‘rapid responses’ that are elicited by still debatable receptor(s) located near or associated with the plasma membrane and its caveolae compartments [4]. These effects occur within minutes after hormone administration, are too rapid to involve changes in gene expression but instead direct an increase in numerous second messengers that can, though, ultimately affect transcription through secondary cross-talk with other (kinase) signal transduction cascades [5,6]. Despite an already substantial quantity of literature on VDR biology - for example, 1α,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3 signaling; classification of agonistic/antagonistic VDR ligands synthesized with the goal to improve the biological profile of the natural hormone for therapeutic application; descriptions of associations between VDR and a variety of interactors as listed in the Primos (http://primos.fh-hagenberg.at) and Biogrid (http://www.thebiogrid.org) database; as well as descriptions of structural motifs and conformational changes responsible for transcriptional control - there remain important regulatory aspects and mechanisms that have not been comprehensively elucidated. By performing a genome-wide yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen using human VDR as bait in order to detect new protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to obtain a more complete understanding of the mode of action of VDR, we were able to identify a previously unknown binding partner, PIM-1 (NCBI accession no. NM_002648). PIM-1 (proviral insertion of Moloney murine leukemia virus), which is a serine/threonine kinase of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated kinase (CAMK) family, phosphorylates different downstream effectors and has accordingly been proposed to play a key role in cell-cycle progression, cell survival, and differentiation of a variety of cell types [7-10]. Here we identify PIM-1 kinase as a novel VDR interacting protein whose overexpression significantly enhances and knock-down suppresses both, endogenous calcitriol response gene transcription (osteopontin) and an extrachromosomal DR3 (direct repeat of 2 hexamers spaced by 3 nucleotides) reporter response. These findings suggest involvement of the VDR-PIM-1 interaction in calcitriol-mediated growth and especially differentiation of keratinocytes.ResultsGenome-wide screening of a human cDNA library for VDR interacting proteins delivered PIM-1 kinase as candidate interactor To identify novel interactors of human VDR we carried out a Y2H assay by screening full length human VDR against a bone marrow cDNA library contained in the pAD-Gate1 to 3 vector system, as described by Maier et al.[11]. From approximately 5 × 106 yeast transformants we recovered a total of 43 different positive clones expressing putative VDR interactors. We concentrated our efforts on one clone encoding a carboxy-terminal fragment of PIM-1 kinase [amino acids (AA) 135–313], as determined via homology searches using NCBI BLAST. However, prior to further experimentation we first demonstrated the existence of PIM-1 mRNA in HaCaT keratinocytes by using gene-specific real-time PCR primers (data not shown); this positive result indicated that our newly identified protein-protein interaction could plausibly take place not only in human bone-marrow but also in human skin cells.The VDR DNA-binding domain is a PIM-1 interaction site We isolated full-length human PIM-1 kinase from the cDNA library using gateway-compatible oligonucleotides and then subcloned the cDNA into pAD-Gate2 via standard BP-/LR-reactions. Now, using the full-length PIM-1 clone, we repeated the Y2H test against VDR and confirmed the positive interaction. To determine the VDR regions potentially involved in PIM-1 binding, we subcloned the VDR fragment encoding the DNA-binding domain and the fragment encoding the ligand-binding domain (LBD) separately into the vector pBD-Gate2 for Y2H screening against full-length PIM-1 as well as the truncated PIM-1 or appropriate negative controls (Figure 1). Yeast cells co-transformed with the VDR LBD and either full-length PIM-1 isoform 2 or truncated PIM-1 (AA 135–312) failed to grow on SD/-trp-leu-ade-his medium, whereas cells expressing both the VDR DNA-binding domain and PIM-1 kinase did grow (Figure 2). This result indicates that the PIM-1 binding site of VDR maps to the fragment encoding the VDR DNA-binding domain.Figure 1 Illustration of the used VDR/Pim-1 variants. (A) In addition to full-length VDR the DNA Binding Domain (DBD: AA 16–125) and the Ligand Binding Domain (LBD: AA 111–427) of the VDR were subjected for Y2H analysis as bait molecules. They were tested with (B) full-length PIM-1 isoform 2 as well as the truncated version of PIM-1 (AA 135–313).Figure 2 Domain analysis of PIM-1 – VDR interaction. (A) Yeast cells co-transformed with PIM-1-pAD-Gate2 and VDR-Fullength-pBD-Gate2 grow directly on PPI selective medium as well as yeast cells co-transformed with PIM-1-pAD-Gate2 and DBD-pBD-Gate2. Cells co-transformed with PIM-1-pAD-Gate2 and LBD-pBD-Gate2, PIM-1-pAD-Gate2 and pBD-Gate2, pAD-Gate2 and VDR-Fullength-pBD-Gate2, pAD-Gate2 and DBD-pBD-Gate2, or pAD-Gate2 and LBD-pBD-Gate2 show no growth on PPI selective medium. (B) All combination show strong growth on medium selective for positive transformation. In silico examination of human PIM-1 kinase revealed the presence of a putative nuclear hormone receptor coregularoty LxxLL motif, namely L228-G-I-L231-L232 (albeit not in a conserved context), within the minimal VDR interaction domain. The general trend for LxxLL motifs (where L is leucine and x is any amino acid) that mediate the association between cofactors and liganded nuclear hormone receptors to modulate transcription includes a hydrophobic residue positioned at −1 and −7, a proline residue at −2, an aromatic residue at −3 and glutamate at location −5 to create an L-x-E/H-x-H/F-P-L/M/I-L-x-x-L-L consensus pattern [12]; however, the PIM-1 sequence in this stretch is R-S-A-A-V-W-S-L228-G-I-L231-L232. Although the AA residues flanking the LxxLL main core motif are known to be important for the recognition of selected classes of nuclear hormone receptors, the exact number and composition of LxxLL motifs can vary considerably among different coactivators [13].PIM-1 kinase and VDR colocalize in the nucleus of HaCaT keratinocytes Mammalian expression constructs for YFP-VDR and red fluorescent PIM-1 were used to transfect cultured HaCaT keratinocytes to visualize the subcellular localization of VDR and PIM-1, and to evaluate the influence of 200 nM calcitriol (or ethanol as vehicle) on this distribution. YFP-tagged VDR was observed to be predominantly located in the nucleus independent of calcitriol treatment and residually in the cytoplasm. This result differs from previous studies, which reported that unliganded VDR partitions consistently between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, as observed in a variety of cell types such as COS-7 cells deficient in expressing endogenous VDR, CV-1 fibroblasts, rat ROS17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells, mouse adenocarcinoma cells, 293 adenovirus-transformed human embryonal kidney cells, and human dermal fibroblasts, and undergoes substantial translocation into the nucleus upon calcitriol treatment [14]. Real-time PCR experiments analyzing expression of CYP24A1 or OPN, which are well known VDR-target genes as well as Western blots of lysates of untransfected HaCaT cells in comparison to YFP-VDR-overexpressing samples (data not shown) have in this context confirmed that the tagged nuclear hormone receptor is fully functional. PIM-1 kinase also was observed to be predominantly nuclear, however, not throughout the complete nucleus. A dense concentration of PIM-1 in an undefined local nuclear region (not corresponding to the nucleolus) was observed, where it patially colocalizes with VDR in HaCaT keratinocytes (Figure 3). A residual cytoplasmic staining was also observed. Its intracellular distribution was not obviously influenced by the presence or absence of calcitriol (data not shown). Previous studies have described both cytoplasmic and especially nuclear PIM-1 localization, as visualized via biochemical cell fractionation studies [15], transfection of a GFP-tagged PIM-1 kinase into HeLa cells [16], or anti-PIM-1 antibody staining approaches [17]; in the latter study the kinase was detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus at an early stage of U937 PMA (phorbol myristate acetate)-induced cell differentiation but then underwent a dramatic shift toward the nucleus after 24 h of exposure to this substance.Figure 3 PIM-1 and VDR co-localization in human keratinocytes.

(C) Image of blue DAPI fluorescence. (D) Overlay of panels A, B and C showing colocalization of PIM-1 and VDR in the nucleus.PIM-1 kinase is not a classical calcitriol target gene To further evaluate the behaviour of PIM-1 kinase upon the treatment with calcitriol, total RNA extracted from cultured HaCaT keratinocytes as well as 293HEK (human embryonic kidney) cells that had been exposed to 200 nM calcitriol (or an equal amount of ethanol) for 16 h was reverse transcribed into cDNA and subjected to real-time PCR analysis. The RNA expression levels were observed with gene-specific primers chosen according to the published sequences of human PIM-1, CYP24A1 (encoding 25-hydroxyvitamin D24-hydroxylase or 24-OHase), a typical positive control target gene whose perceived upregulations were in accordance to recent publications [18], and ANXA1 as internal reference gene. Melting curve examinations, agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA-sequencing determined that the amplified products were indeed specific; in addition, a negative control for each RNA specimen was prepared. Following normalization, calcitriol induction in both cell types was evident, but no difference in the mRNA levels of PIM-1 kinase could be observed, suggesting that PIM-1 kinase is not a calcitriol target gene (Figure 4).Figure 4 Real-Time analysis of PIM-1 trancription in human keratinocytes upon calcitriol stimulation. HaCAT cells were induced either with 0.2 μM calcitriol or with an equal amount of ethanol for 16 h. Levels of gene expression were analyzed by Real-Time PCR, and are shown as fold change differences between vehicle and calcitriol induction relative to the housekeeping gene ANXA1. The expression levels of PIM-1 show no significant differences between calcitriol and ethanol induction (p-value = 0,5), whereas CYP24A1 gene expression shows an enormous increase with calcitriol induction (p-value = 0.0002). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM) of n = 3 values.PIM-1 overexpression enhances mRNA transcription of VDR-target genes and activates response of extrachromosomal VDR-reporter constructs calcitriol independently In a further real-time PCR experiment, we analyzed the effect of overexpression of PIM-1 kinase on osteopontin (OPN) and CYP24A1 (CYP24) mRNA levels in the absence of calcitriol treatment; the expression level of ANXA1 was used as an internal control. The results, presented in Figure 5, clearly show that both OPN and CYP24 mRNA levels are increased by PIM-1 overexpression (36- and 4-fold, respectively), suggesting that PIM-1 kinase overexpression provokes an calcitriol-independent enhancement of OPN and CYP24 transcription mediated by VDR. Because it is conceivable that the endogenous activation of transcription we observed is mediated through epigenetic mechanisms, we also tested a commercially available extrachromosomal DR3 reporter construct designed for accurate, sensitive and quantitative assessment of the activation of signal transduction pathways, bears no other interaction sites for additional transcription factors, and hence confirms that a direct stimulation through VDR binding takes place. For this purpose we co-transfected PIM-1 kinase construct with an equal amount of a VDRE-luc reporter construct into HaCaT cells, treated half of the samples with calcitriol and then performed a Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay in which we detected firefly as well as Renilla luciferase signals with a luminometer. Following normalization of the obtained firefly values by the recorded Renilla signals, we observed a greatly increased calcitriol-stimulated luciferase signal of about 2.8-fold in PIM-1-overexpressing samples compared to cells transfected with an empty expression vector (Figure 6A). Because the cells treated with ethanol showed the same enhancement in the luciferase signal compared to calcitriol induction, we conclude from these studies that overexpression of PIM-1 in HaCaT cells is able to enhance both the calcitriol-independent and calcitriol-dependent extrachromosomal DR3 reporter response.Figure 5 Endogenous VDR target gene mRNA expression in PIM-1 overexpressing human keratinocytes. With PIM-1 overexpression the levels of CYP24A1, PIM-1, and OPN are increased after normalization with the housekeeping gene ANXA1. Results are shown as fold change of PIM-1 overexpression relative to cells transfected with the empty vector. The significant differences of PIM-1 overexpression compared to the empty control vector samples was considered as true by the low p-values. Error bars represent the SEM of n = 3 values.Figure 6 PIM-1 dependent VDR-transactivation. (A) PIM-1 overexpression enhances calcitriol-induced extrachromosomal DR3 reporter response. The luminescence signal increased after induction of the transfected HaCaT cells with 0.2 μM calcitriol for 16 h but not following the addition of an equal amount of ethanol for the same time. The cells transfected with PIM-1 showed a 2.8-fold increase in response to calcitriol compared with the cells transfected with empty vector (pDEST26/neg control). Also, similar signal intensities were observed for vehicle-treated cells transfected with PIM-1 vs. vehicle-treated cells transfected with the empty vector. (B) PIM-1 knockdown through shRNA plasmid constructs reduces the calcitriol-induced extrachromosomal DR3 reporter response to the half compared with the cells transfected with the neg. control shRNA plasmid. Furthermore, about the similar decrease was observed by calcitriol-independent extrachromosomal DR3 reporter response. Vehicle-treated cells transfected with shRNA against PIM-1 vs. vehicle-treated cells transfected with the empty vector (pGFP-V-RS/neg. control) reduces the signal intensity. Error bars represent the SEM of n = 3 values.PIM-1 dependence of VDR mediated transcriptional response was shown by knockdown of endogenous PIM-1 To show PIM-1 dependence of VDR-promoter binding and response gene activation, we knocked down PIM-1 expression by RNAi and analysed transcriptional activation of extrachromosomal DR3 reporter construct. Therefore PIM-1 specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) encoding plasmids were co-transfected with an equal amount of a VDRE-luc reporter construct into HaCaT cells. The transfected cells were treated half with calcitriol and then a Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay was performed. The knockdown of endogenous PIM-1 results in a reduced calcitriol-stimulated luciferase signal to the half compared to the control transfection (Figure 6B). The fact that in calcitriol-independent signalling the shRNA construct against PIM-1 shows about the same reduction compared to the negative control support the theory that PIM-1 is able to enhance extrachromosomal DR3 reporter response independ of calcitriol.PIM-1 kinase was found to take part in the VDR-interacting protein complex of human cells To verify the interaction between PIM-1 and VDR a pull-down of DRIP (VDR interacting protein) complex from cell lysates was performed. Therefore a human keratinocyte lysate was prepared and incubated with a biotinylated synthetic VDR specific LXXLL nuclear receptor binding motif peptide, DRIP2 [19]. The biotinylated DRIP-2 peptide was immobilized using magnetic streptavidin beads. The VDR complex from human keratinocytes was captured by the immobilized DRIP-2 peptide (Figure 7). As a control for unspecific binding a lysate without DRIP-2 was incubated with the beads. The resulting eluates were analyzed by western blotting with an anti-VDR and an anti-PIM1-antibody (Figure 7).Figure 7 Isolation of VDR-protein complex from human keratinocyte cell lysate. (A) Overview of the experimental procedure of the pull-down assay. (B) Western blot analysis with anti-PIM1 and anti-VDR antibody. PIM-1 and VDR were observed only in the lysate captured by the DRIP-2 peptide, while in the control lysate without peptide only unspecific lanes appeared. The expected sizes were for VDR about 48 kD, for PIM-1 about 34 kD and for the putative VDR/PIM-1 complex (unspecific band) respectively about 82 kD. VDR as well as PIM-1 isoform 2 could be detected in the VDR-protein complex from human keratinocyte cell lysates captured by the DRIP-2 peptide. Furthermore, an unspecific protein band appeared which is about the size of an putative VDR/PIM-1 complex (Figure 7). Despite the denaturing conditions of SDS gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis there is still the possibility of an remaining VDR/PIM-1 complex which would be a further evidence for real interaction. In the control neither VDR nor PIM-1 was detected.Discussion The present study reports a previously unknown protein-protein interaction between human VDR and PIM-1 kinase and an involvement of a futher kinase in calcitriol signaling. VDR is an evolutionarily conserved member of the hormone-responsive NHR superfamily, expressed in malignant specimens (e.g. carcinomas and melanomas) and numerous mammalian tissues and, most crucially for our study, in bone and skin where it can be detected in a variety of cell types, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, Langerhans cells, melanocytes, endothelial cells, and B- and T-lymphocytes [20,21]. PIM-1, originally identified as a locus frequently activated by proviral insertion of the Moloney murine leukemia virus [22], encodes a highly conserved 313 AA serine/threonine kinase of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated kinase (CAMK) family whose expression is stimulated by a variety of cytokines, hormones and mitogens. PIM-1 appears to be involved in the control of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and malignant transformation [9,15,17,23]. Putative PIM-1 kinase substrates and interactors include the c-Myb transcription factor nuclear adapter protein p100 [24], the G1-specific cell-cycle regulator Cdc25A [25], HP1 [26], the cdk inhibitor p21cip1/waf1[27], the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein NuMA [28] and the proapoptotic protein Bad [29], which are to a large extent involved in regulating cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. Nevertheless, the altogether small number of reported substrates would seem unlikely to be able to account for the broad spectrum of PIM-1 kinase functions, implying that it most probably interacts with additional, to date unidentified cellular substrates in specific physiological environments. Expression of PIM-1 occurs in a wide range of tissues: hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, hippocampus and oral epithelia. It is significantly upregulated in B-cell lymphomas and erythroleukemias and has, via multi-tissue Northern blotting, been detected in a number of squamous cell carcinoma-derived keratinocyte lines, and in early and late passages of both spontaneously immortalized keratinocytes and normal human epidermal cells where its expression was substantially higher after confluence than during the logarithmic growth phase and correlated with increased keratinocyte differentiation [30-34]. There is an obvious overlap in the expression of VDR and PIM-1 kinase in a variety of calcitriol-responsive tissues. Support for the biological significance of our discovery of a physical interaction between human VDR and PIM-1 kinase is the fact that most nuclear hormone receptors are phosphoproteins [extensively studied examples are ERα [35], PR [36], and mouse RARα [37]], whereby phosphorylation status can apparently govern receptor activity under the prevailing cellular conditions. Human VDR has been shown to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) at serine 51 in the α-helical region that forms the two zinc fingers [38] and by protein kinase A (PKA) at serine 182 [39], which together attenuate the receptor’s VDRE-binding, RXR heterodimerization and transactivation functions. Conversely, calcitriol-stimulated, casein kinase II-catalyzed phosphorylation of human VDR at serine 208 [39-41] does not affect the receptor’s kinetics for hormone binding, its partitioning into the nucleus or its ability to associate with DNA but instead modulates its affinity for the 220 MW DRIP205/TRAP220 subunit of the large DRIP (VDR interacting proteins) mediator complex that directly anchors liganded VDR to components of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and hence amplifies its ability to transactivate target promoters. In addition, activated calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase CaMKIV, which exhibits 30% identity and 45% similarity to PIM-1 (http://www.biobase.international.com), dramatically stimulates calcitriol-activated reporter gene expression by increasing VDR phosphorylation levels and results in enhanced interaction between VDR and SRC coactivator proteins in mammalian two-hybrid studies [42]. Calcitriol also activates mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) kinases in normal human keratinocytes [43] and other cell types [44], thereby providing a rapid mechanism for the hormone to promote its own receptor-mediated action and suggesting a possible connection between the well-established gene regulatory mechanisms mediated through the VDR and the rapid response cascades. Functional studies on other steroid hormone and retinoid receptors have similarly implicated phosphorylation in the regulation of DNA association [45], hormone binding [46], nuclear localization [47] and transcriptional activation [48,49]. Similar modifications have also been reported for a variety of NHR coregulators, including SRC-1, TIF2, RAC3, p300, CBP, NcoR and SMRT [50,51], which may either enhance their interaction with NHRs as well as their abilitiy to recruit histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes (in the case of coactivators) or induce the redistribution of corepressor from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby lessening the potential association between corepressors and NHRs [52-54]. Our domain mapping approaches have nevertheless indicated that the interaction with PIM-1 kinase does not involve the ligand-binding domain of VDR in contrary to the majority of co-activators. The interaction between PIM-1 and VDR is instead restricted to the receptor’s DNA binding domain, a type of interaction that, to our knowledge, has been described only 3 times previously: (i) between VDR and the bone-specific transcription factor Runx2 as a prerequisite to upregulate rat osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts [55]; (ii) between VDR and acute promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) necessary for the regulation of calcitriol-induced monocytic differentiation in hematopoietic cells [56]; and (iii), in a different experimental context, between VDR and the oncogenic nucleoporin CAN/Nup214, a component of the nuclear pore complex [57]. Because yeast two-hybrid experiments do not allow any conclusions about protein-protein interactions in a native cellular environment, we also studied PIM-1 and VDR in the spontaneously immortalized human HaCaT cell line which is known to behave phenotypically like normal basal epidermal keratinocytes in terms of growth and differentiation and to develop in the absence of serum and supplementary exogenous growth factors, features which make it a widely used cell culture system for such studies and an important model for the highly proliferative epidermis [58]. As visualized by overexpressing YFP-VDR and tomato-tagged PIM-1, we could observe significant co-localization of the two proteins in the nucleus of HaCaT keratinocytes, which confirms that both proteins could indeed have the opportunity to interact with each other at the physiological level. We were subsequently able to increase transcription of CYP24A1 and osteopontin mRNA, the latter a classic VDR response gene [59,60], by approximately 50% upon extrachromosomal overexpression of PIM-1 kinase. Furthermore, we similarly observed a clear enhancement of extrachromosomal DR3 reporter response upon PIM-1 overespression and respectively a clear reduction in DR3 reporter response by PIM-1 shRNA mediated knock-down, suggesting that PIM-1 kinase indeed can modulate calcitriol signaling. In an earlier study, Thompson et al.[61] analyzed whether PIM-1 was capable of modulating androgen signaling because androgens are known to play a key role in male physiology as well as in the promotion or progression of prostate cancer and PIM-1 kinase was reported to be markedly overexpressed under such conditions [34]. Ruling out simple explanations like altered receptor levels or DNA binding characteristics, they observed that, under transient transfection conditions, PIM-1 attenuated the transcriptional activity of AR, another NHR superfamily member (and in parallel experiments also of a LBD-deleted AR, GR and ERα), in a dose-dependent fashion in several cell types, but found no evidence for direct phosphorylation of AR by PIM-1 or, in contrast to our results, for a direct protein-protein interaction [61]. They therefore suggested that PIM-1 likely influences AR activity via an indirect mechanism that possibly involves phosphorylation of a coregulator and/or a component of the transcriptional machinery. We could show that PIM-1 binds to the DNA-binding domain of VDR and modulates calcitriol signaling, however, we did not analyse the phosphorylation of VDR by PIM-1. Therefore it remains unclear whether VDR or a different component of the pathway is modulated by PIM-1. Interestingly, and in this context it was reported that PIM-1 enhances the transcriptional activity of c-myb, another transcription factor, by direct phosphorylating the DNA-binding domain as well as the phosphorylation of the transcriptional co-activator p100 [24,62]. In a final pull-down of VDR-interacting protein complexes we investigated the protein complex of VDR by using the facility of a LXXLL containing peptide (DRIP-2) to capture the VDR-interacting co-activator protein complex in cell lysates. We detected the PIM-1 isoform 2 in the eluted fraction containing also VDR, but there is no detection of endogene PIM-1 in the fraction without DRIP-2 capture, so PIM-1 indeed seems to be included into the VDR-complex captured by DRIP-2 peptide, and potentially a member of the DRIP205-VDR co-activator complex [19].Conclusion Because the interaction between PIM-1 kinase and VDR involves the DNA-binding domain of the latter, it is conceivable that this association supports the binding of VDR to VDRE response elements within specific target genes, a hypothesis that will be tested in forthcoming studies aimed at clarifying the mechanism of co-activation.MethodsGenome-wide Y2H screening To construct the bait, the 1284 bp sequence encoding full-length human vitamin D receptor (NCBI accession no. NM_000376) was cloned by recombinational cloning into pDONR/Zeo (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), shuttled into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD)-containing vector pBD-Gate2 [11], and sequenced by using an ABIPRISMTM Cycle Sequencing Kit and an ABI-PRISMTM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). In a preliminary experiment, in which the known interaction between p53 and SV40 large T antigen [63] served as positive control, the construct was found to have no capacity to nonspecifically activate reporter genes. A commercially available human bone marrow cDNA library in the Gateway-compatible pCMV-SPORT6 vector (Invitrogen) was transferred via recombinational cloning into the GAL4 activation domain (AD) containing vectors pAD-Gate1, -Gate2, and -Gate3 [11] vectors and purified by using a GenElute HP Plasmid Maxiprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), resulting in three libraries that differ from each other only in the translational reading frame. To perform a large-scale Y2H screening with the MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-hybrid System 3 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), the VDR-pBD-Gate2 bait and each of the 3 libraries were simultaneously co-transformed into the haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 (genotype: MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2:: GAL1UASGAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATAADE2;URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ MEL1) according to a standard high-efficiency lithium acetate method, and finally plated onto (i) a nutritionally selective plate deficient in tryptophan and leucine (SD/-leu-trp) to test for positive plasmid uptake and general transformation efficiency, and (ii) SD/-trp-leu-ade-his synthetic medium to select for actual reporter activity. The plates were incubated for at least 4 days at 28 °C. The cDNA library vectors from primary positive yeast candidate clones were recovered by plasmid isolation via digestion with 10 U lyticase (Sigma-Aldrich), addition of 10% SDS, one freeze-thaw cycle, and purification by using a Wizard® SV gel and PCR clean-up system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The plasmids were then amplified in E. coli DH5α cells and reintroduced back into the yeast strain AH109 together with the bait or empty pBD-Gate2 (as a control) and finally retested on SD/-trp-leu-ade-his in order to verify their reporter activity before the sequence of the clone was determined by using vector-specific primers. Bioinformatical analyses were conducted through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) by using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) accessible via http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi, the ExPASy Proteomics Server (http://www.expasy.ch/), the Universal Protein Resource UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/) and the SWISS-PROT knowledgebase (http://expasy.org/sprot/). Only putative VDR-interacting candidates passing the control experiments were subjected to further study.Mapping the interacting domains Full-length human PIM-1 kinase isoform 2 subcloned into pDONR/zeo was shuttled into the pAD-Gate2 vector via an LR reaction and used as the prey plasmid in our subsequent domain mapping experiments. The ligand-binding domain (LBD, amino acids 111–427) and the DNA-binding domain (DBD, AA 16–125) of human VDR were similarly cloned into pDONR/Zeo and subsequently shuttled into pBD-Gate2, resulting in bait proteins fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. To identify the protein regions involved in the interaction between PIM-1 kinase and VDR, the particular bait and prey vectors (or the respective empty vectors as negative controls) were co-transformed into the haploid yeast strain AH109 as described above. Positive interactions were indicated by cell growth on SD/-leu-trp-ade-his medium after 4 days of incubation at 28 C. Because direct plating of transformants onto SD/-leu-trp-ade-his medium represents a rather stringent condition that selects for only strong interactors, and hence could fail to detect low-affinity, auto-activating, and perhaps transient interactions, we also tested a less stringent condition, i.e. we picked several random clones from SD/-leu-trp plates, dissolved them in water and finally dropped them onto SD/-leu-trp-ade-his [11].Cell culture techniques and transfection Cell culture experiments were performed with the spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT that was maintained as a monolayer culture under a 5% CO2 at 37 C in Epilife® medium (Cascade Biologics/Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) together with defined human keratinocyte growth supplement (HKGS), 60 μM CaCl2, and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin. For transfection experiments, 1-3×105 HaCaT cells were seeded in flasks or chamber slides that allow cell cultivation in a microscopic carrier (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium, NuncTM/Lab-TEK®, Langenselbold, Germany) to reach approximately 50% to 80% confluence, and electroporated by using a Cell line Nucleofector® kit V (Amaxa Biosystems, Lonza GmbH, Wuppertal, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with a total of 5 μg plasmid DNA.Co-localization studies Human VDR subcloned into pDONR/Zeo [11] was shuttled into pcDNATM6.2/N-EmGFP/YFP-DEST (Invitrogen) via a standard LR reaction to create an N- terminally yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged protein. Human PIM-1 was shuttled from the entry vector into a Gateway®-compatible mammalian red fluorescent pDEST/Tomato destination plasmid which we constructed through insertion of a tomato dimer sequence amplified from pRSET-B tdTomato (Invitrogen) into pcDNATM3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). To investigate the actual co-localization between PIM-1 and VDR, exponentially grown HaCaT cells transfected with a combination of YFP-VDR and Tomato-PIM-1 were cultured onto chamber slides as described above, rinsed with 1x PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS for 10 min and counterstained with 1 μg/ml 1,4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). After three additional washing steps, the coverslips were inverted into mounting medium (MicroTrak®, Trinity Biotech PLC, Wicklow, Ireland) and the fluorescence staining was evaluated with a Zeiss Axioskop MC100 (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Göttingen, Germany).Real-time PCR analysis Total RNA from HaCaT keratinocytes grown to approximately 90% confluence was isolated with an RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the kit’s manual. RNA purity and concentration were analysed using a Nanodrop® ND-1000 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (PEQLAB GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) and RNA integrity visually assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. After a 20-min digest with DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) at 25 C to remove DNA contamination, 0.55 μg of purified RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with an iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) by incubating the reaction for 5 min at 25 C, for 30 min at 42 C, and for an additional 5 min at 85 C in a programmable thermocycler. The resulting cDNA (or an equal amount of DNase-digested RNA for a negative control) was used as a template for quantitative real-time PCR using an iQ™ SYBR green Supermix, an iCycler™ apparatus (both Bio-Rad Laboratories) and the following conditions: a hot-start incubation at 95 C for 5 min and 50 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 C for 30 s, primer annealing at 60 C for 20 s, and elongation at 72 C for 20 s, followed by 50 cycles of fluorescence acquisition that determines the specifity of the amplified products and verifies the absence of oligonucleotide-dimer formation. All PCRs were carried out in a final total volume of 25 μl and were performed in triplicates for each cDNA sample. The real-time primers used in this study were designed by using Primer3 software available at http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi. A complete list of oligonucleotides is given in Table 1. The obtained data were normalized against annexin A1, an unregulated endogenous reference transcript, as control for any analytic variation. Results were analyzed with the iCycler iQ™ optical system software 3.1 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) by comparing the distinct cycle threshold values (ct). The differences between the analyzed samples compared to their controls were shown as fold change and respective p-values were calculated using a homoscedastic t-test (only data with p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant).Table 1 Primer sequences for the Real-Time PCR Analysisgene nameAbbreviationAcc No SequenceProduct sizeAnnexinANXA1NM_000700forward5´- GCAGGCCTGGTTTATTGAAA −3´203 bpreverse5´- GCTGTGCATTGTTTCGCTTA −3´Cyp24A1CYP24NM_000782forward5´- GGCAACAGTTCTGGGTGAAT −3´249 bpreverse5´- TATTTGCGGACAATCCAACA −3´OsteopontinONNM_000582forward5´- TGAAACGAGTCAGCTGGATG −3´162 bpreverse5´- TGAAATTCATGGCTGTGGAA −3´PIM-1 kinasePIM1NM_002648forward5´- CAGAGTGGATCCGCTACCAT −3´226 bpreverse5´- TGGATTTCTTCGAAGGTTGG −3´Reporter assay measurements and PIM-1 knockdown PIM-1 kinase was shuttled via an LR reaction into the mammalian destination vector pDEST26 (Invitrogen) and transfected into HaCaT cells together with a VDRE-luc reporter (Cignal Vitamin D Reporter Kit, CCS-2029 L, SABiosciences Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA), which gives reproducible, sensitive and specific measurements of changes in transcriptional activities. The VDRE-luc reporter is a mixture of (i) an inducible firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase reporter gene under control of a basal TATA box control element joined to tandem repeats of a specific transcriptional response element, and (ii) a constitutively expressed Renilla (Renilla reniformis) luciferase regulated by a CMV immediate early enhancer/promoter that can be used as an internal reference for standardizing experimental variabilities such as transfection efficiencies and cell viability. As a negative control, empty pDEST26 was co-transfected with VDRE-luc in a parallel approach. Transfected samples were split into a Corning® CellBIND® Surface plate (Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, MA, USA) and incubated for 48 h at 37 C before the samples were treated with 0.2 μM calcitriol or an equal amount of ethanol as vehicle for further 16 h. The cells were then gently and rapidly lysed with passive lysis buffer (provided with the kit), which is formulated to circumvent the need for scraping of adherent cells or additional freeze-thaw cycles. The assay was developed by measuring the activities of firefly and Renilla luciferase reporters sequentially from each sample by using a Dual-Luciferase® Reporter (DLR™) System (Promega). Promoter activity values were expressed as arbitrary units after normalization and correction for background reactivity. The PARADIGM™ Detection Platform (Beckman Coulter® Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA) was used for signal detection. For PIM-1 knockdown PIM-1 specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) encoding plasmid constructs in pGFP-V-RS was obtained from Origene (HuSH™-29; Origene, Rockville, MD, USA). The set of four 29mer shRNA constructs (Table 2) were co-transfected with VDRE-luc reporters into HaCaT cells. As negative control the empty shRNA pGFP-V-RS vector (Origene) was used with VDRE-luc. The assays were induced by calcitriol or an equal amount of ethanol and measured in the same way. All data between calcitriol treated and control cells were calculated to be statistically significant using a homoscedastic t-test (only data with p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant).Table 2 PIM-1-specific shRNA sequences for PIM-1-knockdownconstruct29mer SequenceGI362006TGG AAG TGG TCC TGC TGA AGA AGG TGA GCGI362007CTG CTC AAG GAC ACC GTC TAC ACG GAC TTGI362008CCT GAG ACC ATC AGA TAG GCC AAC CTT CGGI362009CAG AAT GTC AGC ATC TCA TTA GAT GGT GCIsolation of VDR-protein complex from human keratinocyte cell lysate HaCaT keratinocytes grown to approximately 90% confluence were lysed using RIPA-buffer (Sigma-Aldrich,Taufkirchen, Germany). The flasks were washed twice with 10 ml cold PBS, incubated in 750 μl RIPA-buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail for 10 min at 25 °C followed by 10 min incubation at −80 °C. Cells were collected with a cell scrapper, and quantified using a classical Bradford assay. 6 mg of the lysates were pre-incubated with 50 μl magnetic Streptavidin beads (Dynabeads®MyOne™Streptavidin T1 Invitrogen) for 10 min. The beads were captured and the lysates were incubated without and with 1 μg of a synthetic biotinylated DRIP-2 peptide (Genway Biotech.Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The DRIP-2 peptide is an LXXLL motif containing peptide (N – NTKNHPMLMNLLKDNPAQD – C) with the facility to bind the VDR [19]. After overnight incubation 100 μl magnetic streptavidin beads were added to the lysates and incubated for 1.5 h at 25 °C. The beads were washed 4 times each 10 min with TBS + 0.05%TWEEN and then captured by a magnetic stand. The beads were resolved with 30 μl LDS-loading buffer and incubated for 5 min at 96 °C to elute the complex. 5 μl of each eluted protein peptide complexes were further analyzed by standard western blot procedures. The primary antibodies were the commercially available rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-human VDR antibody (sc-1008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for the VDR and the commercial available rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-human PIM-1 antibody (sc-28777; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for PIM-1. For detection, an HRP conjugated swine anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody (P0217; Dako, Glostrub, Denmark) was used.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors’ contributions KÖ provided the original concept of the study, supervised the study and contributed to writing the paper.

Introduction Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most deadly of cancers, with a five year survival after diagnosis of about 5% [1], [2]. That is mainly due to the fact that in the early stages of pancreatic cancer development it often does not cause symptoms, and later the symptoms are nonspecific and varied [3]. Therefore, pancreatic cancer is not diagnosed until it is advanced. Currently, the first line treatment of choice for patients with pancreatic cancer is gemcitabine [4]. However, response rates to gemcitabine vary widely [5]. Previous pharmacogenetic studies have focused on genes in the gemcitabine metabolism pathways and demonstrated that either expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in those genes could only explain a portion of the observed variability in drug response [5], [6], [7]. Recently, using a genome-wide approach with 197 human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) model system, we identified FKBP5 as a top candidate that was significantly associated with sensitivity to this antineoplastic agent [7]. Variation in FKBP5 expression alone accounted for 14% of the variation in gemcitabine IC50 values observed in these LCLs while all 17 of the genes in gemcitabine metabolism pathway combined accounted for only 27 percent of the variation [7]. FKBP51 belongs to a family of large immunophilins, and it catalyzes the conversion of the cis and trans isomers of peptide bonds with the amino acid proline, a reaction that is important for protein folding [8]. FKBP51 is encoded by the gene, FKBP5 [9]. Our previous studies suggested that the level of FKBP5 expression is associated with variation in chemosensitivity to gemcitabine as well as other antineoplastic agents [7]. Subsequent studies revealed that FKBP51 functions as a scaffolding protein promoting the interaction between Akt and PHLPP [10]. Specifically, FKBP51 acts as a negative regulator of the Akt pathway and, under the genotoxic stress, directs cells towards apoptosis [10]. We also showed that FKBP5 expression level could potentially be used as a biomarker for treatment selection of gemcitabine with or without Akt inhibitors using pancreatic cancer xenograft mice [11]. In the current study, we hypothesized that genetic variation in FKBP5 might contribute to regulation of its expression, thus contributing to gemcitabine response and ultimately affecting patient survival. Therefore, we set out to identify genetic variation in FKBP5 by performing Next Generation resequencing of this gene in 60 tumor and normal DNA samples obtained from 43 pancreatic cancer patients treated with gemcitabine. Genotype-phenotype association studies were performed using the SNPs identified during FKBP5 resequencing, and the phenotypes included overall survival and FKBP5 gene expression in tumor samples. Functional genomic studies suggested that rs73748206 might contribute to gemcitabine treatment response by increasing FKBP5 expression through increased binding to glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a known regulator of FKBP5 expression [12], [13]. This comprehensive FKBP5 pharmacogenomic study provides enhanced understanding of the role of inheritance in variation in gemcitabine response in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.Materials and MethodsPatient Cohort The samples were all derived from pancreatic cancer patients treated with gemcitabine at the Mayo Clinic, and included samples from 39 tumor and 21 adjacent tissues (normal), with 19 paired tumor and normal samples. Specifically, these samples were from patients with stage two or three adenocarcinoma who underwent Whipple procedure or pancreatectomy (distal or total) performed at the Mayo Clinic from 2000–2010 and from whom frozen tumor and/or adjacent tissue specimens were available for DNA and RNA extraction. Available phenotypic data for this sample set included overall survival and treatment information. In addition, we obtained genome-wide basal mRNA expression data for all of the tumor tissue samples. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were also established from a subset of these patients. Demographic data for the patients are listed in Table S1. Patients enrolled into the study provided written informed consent for participation in the Mayo Clinic Biospecimen Resource for Pancreas Research. Studies were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.FKBP5 Gene Resequencing FKBP5 was resequenced in 60 DNA samples from pancreatic cancer patients by performing Next Generation sequencing using an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina, San Diego, CA) (Table S2). Resequencing covered a 160 kb genomic region on chromosome 6p21 that contained FKBP5 utilizing methods described previously [14]. Sanger sequencing of FKBP5 was used for validation purposes and was performed with the same DNA samples. This type of sequencing was performed in the Mayo Molecular Biology Core Facility with an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). However, in this case, resequencing was focused on regions covering exons, exon-intron splice junctions and approximately 1000 bp of 5′- and 3′-flanking regions (FRs) (Table S3). There was sequence concordance for regions resequenced using both methods.Expression Array Data We generated expression array data for our pancreatic cancer patient cohort as described previously [10]. In brief, RNA was extracted from surgically obtained patient samples with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Once the RNA passed quality control using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), it was hybridized to Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). This data have been deposited in the GEO database with the accession number GSE16515.Statistical Methods The relationship between individual SNPs and survival was modeled using Cox proportional hazards models. Due to the relatively small size of the sample, tests based on the likelihood ratio statistic, but using empirical distributions of these statistics based on 50,000 permutations of the phenotype were used. Analysis of individual markers can be underpowered for rare markers. Therefore, we employed two different methods to test the association of a set of markers with the phenotypes. First, to test the association of FKBP5 markers as a whole or in a sub-region of FKBP5 with FKBP5 expression, the expression probes representing FKBP5 were averaged, and then this average was dichotomized based on the median. We then employed our novel method, difference in minor allele frequency (DMAF) test, to test the association of a set of markers with this new FKBP5 expression phenotype. A more detailed description of DMAF can be found in Brisbin et al. (2012) [15]. Sliding windows of 10–50 markers were used to localize the signal within the gene and type I error within a sliding window size was controlled using permutation based methods, which were also described in further detail by Brisbin et al. [15]. To test the association between survival and SNPs, we used a rare variant burden type test [16]. Briefly, the count of variant alleles was summed over all of the FKBP5 markers for the analysis of FKBP5 as one entity. At the same time, variants were also summed in smaller regions of 10 to 50 SNPs (windows, or sub-regions of FKBP5). These sums of variants were used as predictors in separate Cox proportional hazards models of survival. The effect of the count of variant alleles was tested using likelihood ratio tests, and permutation based methods were used to control type I error for a given window size [15].Cell Culture and Transfections To create variant constructs for the two nonsynonymous cSNPs, Thr(17)Ala and Glu(383)Leu, that were identified during the resequencing of FKBP5, site-directed mutagenesis was employed, as described previously [17], using primers listed in Table S4A. HEK293T cells (ATCC) were used to perform transfections with the pIRES-GFP/Flag empty vector (EV), WT, and variant constructs using the Lipofectamine2000 protocol (Life Technology, Grand Island, NY). GFP signal values were used to correct for possible variation in transfection efficiency.Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines and Drug Treatment Lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from pancreatic cancer patients corresponding to variant or WT genotypes for the rs73748206 SNP were cultured in RPMI plus 15% FBS media, and were used to perform expression analysis of FKBP5 and GR. Assays were performed in triplicate at each drug concentration in 6-well plates at a density of 1×106 cells per well. The cells were treated with gemcitabine (Eli Lilly) (10 mmol/L, 0.1 mmol/L, 0.1 umol/L) or dexamethasone (Steraloids, Newport, RI) (500 nM) for 24 h and mRNA was extracted for the analysis (QuickRNA MiniPrep, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA).Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed with the 1-step Brilliant SYBR Green QRT-PCR master mix kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers were purchased from Qiagen, and all experiments were performed in triplicate with GFP or β-actin as an internal control.Reporter Gene Assays Regions surrounding the SNPs (350–600 bp; depending on the SNP location) were amplified using the PCR and cloned into the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Primer sequences are listed in Table S4B. DNA sequences were verified by Sanger sequencing. Specifically, Su86 and HupT3 cells lines, seeded at 1.5×105 cells/well (6-well plates), were transfected with WT, variant or vector constructs together with a pRL-TK DNA construct encoding Renilla luciferase as a control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity was measured using a dual luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI) with a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Results were expressed as the ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase light units. All values were expressed as a percentage of the pGL3 promoter construct activity.Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) EMS assays were performed with nuclear extracts from two pancreatic cancer cell lines, Su86 and HupT3 (ATCC), using the LightShiftTM Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL), as described previously [17]. WT and variant sequences for rs73748206 probes are listed in Table S4C. For competition assays, a 400-fold excess of unlabeled probe was added to the reaction mixture. For the supershift assay, glucocorticoid receptor antibody (GR Ab; Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the reaction mixture.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP) ChIP assays were performed using the Imprint Ultra ChIP kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and were performed according to the manufacturer instructions using an antibody against GR or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, CA) as a control. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was used to determine the ChIP assay results.ResultsIntroduction We studied the role of genetic variation in FKBP5 and its effect on FKBP5 gene transcriptional regulation as well as response to gemcitabine in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. We first focused on the identification of genetic variants in FKBP5 by the use of Next Generation sequencing of this gene in 60 samples from tumor and adjacent normal tissues that were derived from 43 patients (patient demographic data are listed in Table S1; gene resequencing results are listed in Table S2). We then performed an association study with overall survival and FKBP5 expression to identify candidate SNPs that might be associated with patient overall survival (OS) or variation in FKBP5 expression in response to chemotherapy (Figure 1). Finally, functional genomic studies were performed for the non-synonymous cSNPs in addition to the regulatory SNPs selected from the association analysis in an attempt to understand mechanisms by which these SNPs might influence FKPB51 function, and in turn, response to gemcitabine in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.10.1371/journal.pone.0070216.g001Figure 1SNP selection for functional genomic studies.

Abbreviations: SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; ns cSNP, non-synonymous coding SNP; DMAF, Difference in Minor Allele Frequency.FKBP5 Gene Resequencing To identify genetic variation in the FKBP5 gene, we performed Next Generation sequencing of DNA derived from 60 pancreatic tumor and normal tissue samples obtained from pancreatic cancer patients by sequencing an area of 160 kb of DNA on chromosome 6p21. We found 404 SNPs, with 326 having a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 1% (Table S2), including 2 non-synonymous coding SNPs (ns cSNPs), Thr(17)Ala and Gln(383)Leu. Thirty two SNPs were novel as compared to the “1000 Genomes Project” (Phase 1 data, [18]) and/or dbSNP data. We also identified three novel insertions/deletions (indels) (Table S5) as compared to our previous FKBP5 resequencing results utilizing a “Human Variation Panel” sample set involving DNA from 288 subjects of three ethnic groups [19]. Sanger sequencing identified 23 SNPs and all of them were in concordance with the results of the Next Generation sequencing (Table S3).Association Analysis While observing an overall survival (OS) of pancreatic cancer patients from whom DNA was obtained for sequencing of FKBP5, the ns cSNP, Thr(17)Ala, a SNP that was in perfect linkage disequilibrium, LD, (LD = 1) with two other regulatory SNPs, was only present in the individual with the shortest survival time of all individuals in this set of samples. This observation provided anecdotal evidence of interest. This SNP had a MAF<1%, indicating that it might be a rare, private mutation identified in this particular patient, although this same SNP was observed in the “1000 Genomes” project [18] with the same MAF<1%. Next, we looked at the entirety of FKBP5, and sub-regions within the gene (via sliding windows), to aggregate signals from both rare and common SNPs with survival and FKBP5 expression. For survival, there were 50 SNPs in the top window for this association (in tumor samples only) with p = 0.413, as illustrated in Figure 1 (top window SNPs listed in Table S6). We also performed sliding window analysis of resequenced SNPs for their association with FKPB5 expression levels for the same samples. Since FKBP5 has three probe sets represented in the Affymetrix expression array, 224856_at, 224840_at and 204560_at, we decided to use the top window associated with average expression levels derived from all three FKBP5 probe sets. The top window that was associated with FKPB5 expression contained 25 SNPs with a p-value = 0.182, as shown in Figure 1A (top window SNPs listed in Table S6). To gain the mechanistic insights of these variants, we pursued them with functional genomic studies.Functional Genomic StudiesNs cSNPs: Ala17 and Leu383 We began our functional genomic studies with characterization of SNPs found in the coding regions. In our sample set, two ns cSNPs were identified in both tumor and adjacent tissue samples with MAFs for both SNPs <3%. Even though Ala17 was observed only in the patient with the shortest survival time, we studied both of the ns cSNPs since they might alter the level and function of the encoded enzyme, as has been shown by our laboratory previously [20]. Expression constructs were created for WT and variant sequences of the ns cSNPs and overexpressed in HEK293T as well as Su86 and Miapaca2 cell lines (ATCC). Quantitative Western blot analysis was completed to determine protein levels, followed by determining mRNA levels with QRT-PCR (Figure S1A). Additionally, we performed gemcitabine cytotoxicity studies using cells overexpressing WT and variant constructs to see if these FKBP51 variant allozymes would affect response to drug treatment (Figure S1A). There were no statistically significant differences between the FKBP51 WT and variant allozymes in the results of any of the functional assays.SNPs in regulatory regions Next, we focused on characterization of the SNPs in the regulatory regions, since these SNPs might affect expression of FKBP5 which is critical for its effect on gemcitabine response [7]. Based on the sliding window association analysis, there were 50 SNPs in the top window for association with survival, as illustrated in Figure 1A. Even though the p-value for this association was not significant, which could be due to the low number of the patient samples we had available for the analysis, we still decided to examine this group of SNPs since they might help us understand the mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation of FKBP5. Among the 50 SNPs, except for one ns cSNP (Thr(17)Ala), all 49 SNPs were located in regulatory regions of the gene. First, we determined if any of these 49 SNPs were in regions of transcription factor (TF) binding by annotating them using the Human Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Five [(rs73746499, rs116796504, 35716217 (genomic location of a novel SNP for which an rs# has not been assigned), rs73748206, rs148128369)] of the 49 SNPs were in a region predicted to bind TFs, as illustrated in the flow chart in Figure 1B. SNPs rs73746499 and rs73748206 were in LD, R2 = 0.82, and both had MAFs of 4%. SNPs rs116796504, 35716217, and rs148128369 had MAFs<1%. Since the expression of FKBP5 regulates cell chemosensitivity [7] and, therefore, it can affect patients survival, we next checked if any of these five SNPs selected from the survival analysis were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the SNPs in the top window from the sliding window analysis of FKBP5 expression (Figure S2). Four SNPs (rs73746499, rs116796504, rs73748206, rs148128369) were in LD with the SNPs in the top window from the expression analysis (R2>0.8). Therefore, those four SNPs were selected for further functional characterization studies (Table 1).10.1371/journal.pone.0070216.t001Table 1SNPs selected for functional characterization studies.SNPs selected for functional genomic studiesrs#LocationMAFTFrs14812836935720889/Intron 1<1%NFKBrs7374820635715933/Intron 24%GRrs7374649935686829/Intron 54%GRrs11679650435686808/Intron 5<1%GR Abbreviations: MAF, minor allele frequency; TF, transcription factor; GR, glucocorticoid receptor.Functional characterization of regulatory SNPs We performed a series of experiments to assess the possible functional significance of the selected SNPs. We first performed a reporter gene assay to determine the effect of these four SNPs on transcriptional activity using two human pancreatic cancer cell lines, Su86 and HupT3, both of which express FKBP5. The regions containing the rs73746499 and rs148128369 SNPs did not show a significant change in luciferase activity (data not shown). Transcriptional activity was significantly decreased with the reporter gene construct containing the region harboring the rs116796504 SNP as compared to the luciferase promoter control in both cell lines (p-value <0.05). However, only in HupT3 cells but not in Su86 cells, there was a statistically significant difference between WT and the Variant construct (p-value <0.05). On the other hand, the region containing the variant sequence for rs73748206 resulted in a more than two fold induction in luciferase activity as compared to the WT and the control (Figure 2A) in both pancreatic cancer cell lines, Su86 and HupT3, (p-value <0.05). Based on these initial results we decided to focus our further functional characterization on the rs73748206 SNP.10.1371/journal.pone.0070216.g002Figure 2Functional characterization of the rs73748206 using pancreatic cancer cell lines. (A) Reporter Gene Assay performed in HupT3 and Su86 cells, using Basic and pGL3 promotor constructs: empty vector (EV), wild type (WT), and variant (Var).

(B) EMS assays with nuclear extract derived from Su86 and HupT3 cell lines. An arrow indicates the band that was observed with the variant but not the WT sequences. (C) Supershift assay. Increasing concentrations of anti- glucocorticoid receptor antibody were incubated with both, WT and Variant sequences, and Su86 nuclear extract. We next performed electromobility shift assays (EMSA) using nuclear extract from Su86 and HupT3. Figure 2B shows that incubation with the nuclear extract resulted in complex formation in the presence of variant, but not WT oligonucleotides for rs73748206 in both cell lines. Next, we wanted to see if co-incubation of the oligonucleotides that showed a differential protein-DNA binding pattern with antibodies against the transcription factor (TF), predicted by TransFast database, would reduce the intensity of the band. For the rs73748206 SNP, addition of increased concentrations of GR antibody in the presence of the variant oligonucleotides resulted in the gradual disappearance of the initially observed band (Figure 2C). This result suggested that GR antibody can competitively bind to the transcription factor complex present in the nuclear extract, and that this transcription factor complex including GR is responsible for binding to the DNA region surrounding the rs73748206. Finally, we took advantage of LCL derived from the same 43 patients to determine the effect of rs73748206 in vivo. Using these cell lines, we could perform a series of experiments based on FKBP5 rs73748206 genotypes, since this particular variant was found in both tumor and normal tissues. We first confirmed the sequence by sequencing a 689 bp region surrounding the SNP using DNA from the LCLs that we had available for the variant (n = 1) and the WT (n = 3). In this sample set, we only had a heterozygous cell line for the rs73748206 SNP. Therefore we only used the heterozygous cell line for the following experiments. It is already known that FKBP5 expression is regulated by GR and that GR sensitivity can also be regulated by FKBP51 [21]. In the next series of experiments, we wanted to determine whether GR binds to rs73748206 using these cell lines with the naturally occurred SNP. We first performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay by utilizing cell lines homozygous for rs73748206 WT or heterozygote for the variant that were pretreated with 500 nM dexamethasone. There was a two-fold increase in binding of GR in heterozygous as compared to WT cells (Figure 3A). We then determined the effect of different genotypes of this SNP on FKBP5 expression. There was a significant change in expression of FKBP5 in the heterozygous cells as compared to WT (Figure 3B). To test whether gemcitabine treatment might have an effect on FKBP5 expression in LCLs and if so, whether there was a SNP-dependent effect on this regulation, we treated WT and heterozygous cells with gemcitabine and determined the FKBP5 expression levels. We found that the expression of FKBP5 was significantly altered in a SNP-dependent fashion with increased concentrations of gemcitabine (Figure 3C). Interestingly, we also found that GR expression levels were also altered in a SNP and gemcitabine dosage-dependent fashion (Figure 3C). Particularly, there was a significant increase (p-value <0.05) in expression of FKBP5 and GR in cells with the heterozygous genotype at around 0.1 µM of gemcitabine, a concentration that is close to gemcitabine IC50 value in these cell lines [7]. These results suggested a feedback loop between FKBP5 and GR regulation in a SNP-dependent fashion. Results for the functional characterization of rs73748206 were consistent between in vitro and in vivo studies, which would suggest that this particular variant SNP might contribute to gemcitabine treatment response.10.1371/journal.pone.0070216.g003Figure 3Functional characterization of the rs73748206 using pancreatic cancer patients’ lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs).

Therefore, novel approaches to individualize treatment are needed to fight this fatal disease. There have been several DNA sequencing studies of pancreatic tumor that were designed to define the predominant mutations in this disease [22], [23]. All of those studies were performed with a small number of pancreatic tumor samples (n<25). That is most likely due to the fact that pancreatic cancer is not diagnosed until it is already in its late stage or is metastatic, thus precluding surgery and resecting the tumor. Because of a limited number of treatment options for pancreatic cancer patients, novel insights into not only the pathogenesis of this disease but also into its therapy are needed. After Burris et al [4] demonstrated that gemcitabine is a superior drug as compared to fluorouracil (5-FU) in advanced pancreatic cancer, gemcitabine became the standard of treatment for this lethal disease. We previously have shown that variation in FKBP5 gene expression is the contributor to the variation in gemcitabine response due to the role of FKBP51 in regulation of the Akt pathway [7], [10], [24]. In the present study, we set out to comprehensively study how FKBP5 genetic polymorphisms might play a role in gemcitabine response and, ultimately, overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Therefore, we focused on functional characterization of genetic variation in FKBP5 that we identified through Next Generation DNA sequencing (Table S2). We first performed a genotype-phenotype association analysis using a sliding window methodology (Figure 1A) to identify and then to systematically study the top selected genetic variants and their role in response to gemcitabine treatment. Interestingly, when we examined overall survival of the patients, one of the two ns cSNPs, Thr(17)Ala, that we identified during the resequencing study was found in the individual with the poorest survival after drug treatment. However, we did not observe any significant alteration as a result of this allozyme during our functional studies (Figure S1). This same SNP was observed in the “1000 Genomes Project” [18]. However, it was not included in the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), most likely due to the low MAF of this SNP (<1%), and a low number of samples in this database (n = 23) [22]. Next, we focused on the functional characterization of SNPs within regulatory regions of FKBP5. We performed a sliding window analysis, a method that allowed us to consider not only common but also rare variants together (Figure 1A) [15]. Despite the fact that the p-values for association of FKBP5 SNPs with patient survival or FKBP5 gene expression were not significant, this approach helped us to identify a novel functional SNP, rs73748206, which influenced FKBP5 expression through interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (Figures 1, 2 and 3). This SNP is located in Intron 2 of FKBP5 and the “C (G)” genotype is conserved across species (www.ensembl.org). It has a 4% MAF for “T (A)” which is confirmed by “1000 Genomes Project” data. This SNP is in LD (R2 = 1) with rs73746499, a SNP that we originally had chosen to functionally characterize, but did not observe any significant changes in our initial studies of that SNP. Rs73748206 is located within a GR binding site and also within DNaseI hypersensitivity clusters (annotated at http://genome.ucsc.edu), indicating that this area may be transcriptionally active, which was confirmed in our functional studies (Figures 2 and 3). There are no predicted methylation sites within the region containing rs73748206 (annotated at http://genome.ucsc.edu). GR is a transcription factor known to modulate FKBP5 gene expression [12], [13] as well as its own expression [25], [26], [27], [28]. Conversely, FKB51 protein negatively regulates GR sensitivity to glucocorticoids [29]. In our preliminary studies, we noticed that knock-down of FKBP5 expression in pancreatic cancer cells can contribute to decreased GR expression (Figure S3A). In addition, when we treated pancreatic cancer cells with gemcitabine, the expression of FKBP5 as well as GR was upregulated in a dose dependent manner (Figure S3B), even when GR expression was initially knocked-down in these cells (Figure S3C). These preliminary experiments suggested that FKBP5 might also contribute to the regulation of GR expression. This relationship might be due to the fact that FKBP5 regulates GR activity [21], [30], [31] which influences GR function as a transcription factor that can regulate both FKBP5 gene expression and the expression of GR itself [26], [27], [28]. In turn, if there is an increase in GR expression in the cell, that might increase FKBP5 gene expression. This phenomenon could possibly explain the effect of rs73748206 on the regulation of FKBP5 and GR as well as its effect on gemcitabine response in a SNP-dependent manner. There has been an increased interest in FKBP51 over the past decade, especially in terms of its implications in psychiatry or psychological disorders (reviewed in [21]). This is mainly due to its chaperone role in a complex with HSP90 and GR and its role in responsiveness to glucocorticoids (reviewed in [32]). Our laboratory previously reported a novel function of FKBP51 and its role in cancer in response to chemotherapy, particularly treatment with cytidine analogues, gemcitabine and cytarabine [7]. FKBP5 SNPs have already been implicated in regulating treatment response in cancer, such as acute myeloid leukemia [33]. In the study by Mitra et al. in which patients were treated with cytarabine, another cytidine analogue, it was shown that an intronic SNP, rs3798346, was significantly associated with event free and overall survival, indicating that FKBP5 polymorphisms might contribute to drug treatment response. In summary, the present study provides additional evidence suggesting that SNPs in FKBP5 might contribute to gemcitabine response in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Although our study needs to be validated in a large cohort, it indicates that rs73748206 could potentially be a novel biomarker to predict patient response to gemcitabine therapy and represents a step toward the individualized chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer.Supporting InformationFigure S1Functional characterization of FKBP5 allozymes.

Introduction Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers and major causes of cancer death worldwide, especially in Eastern Asia, according to the latest global estimation published in 2011 [1]. Despite a remarkable decrease in GC incidence in most parts of the world, there is still a great burden from the large number of GC cases and deaths worldwide. The carcinogenesis of GC is a very complicated process [2]–[5] involving the dysregulation of multiple genes [6]–[8], including oncogenes [9]–[14] and tumor suppressors [15]–[18]. However, the molecular mechanisms required for GC development and progression need to be further explored. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of endogenously expressed, non-coding small RNAs (20–25 nucleotides in length) known to negatively regulate gene expression by suppressing translation or decreasing the stability of mRNAs by directly binding to the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of target mRNAs [19], [20]. Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs play important roles in development, metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In addition, aberrant post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs by miRNAs is related to tumorigenesis [21]. Abnormal expression profiles of miRNAs have been detected in various types of human tumors, including lung [22], breast [23], prostate [24], liver [25], colon [26], and gastric cancer [27]. Moreover, some miRNAs can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors by regulating the expression of target genes which play important roles in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or proliferation. miR-22 [28], miR-101 [29], and miR-7 [30] have all been shown to be downregulated in tumor specimens and function as tumor suppressors; miR-17 [31] and miR-21 [32] have been shown to be upregulated in tumor specimens and function as oncogenes. These studies indicate that dysregulation of miRNAs is frequently involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Recent studies have suggested that miR-149 may play an important role in various diseases, including the progression of malignant tumors. miR-149 has been shown to function as both a tumor suppressor [33] and an oncogene [34] in the development of multiple types of solid tumors. For example, loss of miR-149 leads to gain of function of some oncogenes and correlate with tumor grade in renal cell carcinoma [35], astrocytomas [36], and prostate carcinoma [37]. Ectopic expression of miR-149 induces apoptosis of neuroblastoma and HeLa cells [33]. Elevated expression of miR-149 has been reported to be important in the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [38] and melanoma metastasis [34]. Furthermore, dysregulation of miR-149 is also implicated in some non-neoplastic diseases. For example, downregulation of miR-149 expression is involved in the development of primary myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia [39], and the loss of miR-149 can suppress hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA abundance [40]. However, the expression pattern and role of miR-149 in the development of GC remains unclear. In the present study, we found that miR-149 is significantly downregulated in GC cell lines and clinical samples in comparison to the normal gastric epithelial cell and adjacent non-tumor tissues, respectively. Ectopic expression of miR-149 inhibits proliferation and induces G0/G1 arrest of AGS and SGC7901 cells in vitro by targeting ZBTB2. Furthermore, depletion of ZBTB2 by siRNA results in inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle arrest. The expression pattern of miR-149 and ZBTB2 in GC cell lines and clinical samples were inversely correlated, further suggesting that ZBTB2 is a target gene of miR-149. Introduction of miR-149 results in alterations in the expression of p53, p21, ARF, and HDM2, members of the ARF-HDM2-p53-p21 pathway which is regulated by ZBTB2. In summary, these results confirm that miR-149 is downregulated in GC cells and clinical samples and suggest that miR-149 functions as a suppressor of gastric cancer cell growth by inhibiting proliferation and cell cycle progression.ResultsExpression of miR-149 is downregulated in GC cell lines and clinical samples To assess the role of miR-149 in the carcinogenesis of GC, we first used quantitative RT-PCR to measure the expression of miR-149 in human GC cell lines (MKN45, GC9811, AGS, SGC7901, and MKN28) and found that miR-149 was downregulated in GC cell lines compared to a normal gastric epithelial cell line, GES-1 (Fig. 1A). In particular, the expression level of miR-149 was positively correlated with the differentiation degree of GC cells. Namely, the expression level of miR-149 in poorly differentiated cell lines, such as MKN45, GC9811, and AGS, is significantly lower than in moderately and well-differentiated cell lines. The expression of miR-149 in moderately differentiated cells, SGC7901, is lower than that in the well-differentiated cell line, MKN28 (Fig. 1A).10.1371/journal.pone.0041693.g001Figure 1miR-149 expression is downregulated in gastric cancer cell lines and clinical samples. A. expression of miR149 in 5 human gastric cancer cell lines relative to the normal human gastric epithelial cell line,GES-1, was measured by quantitative RT-PCR (The values indicate the mean ±SEM, n = 3,t-test,*, p<0.05;*** p<0.001). B. expression of miR149 in 44 human gastric cancer clinical samples relative to their paired normal samples was measured by quantitative RT-PCR (The values indicate the mean ±SEM, n = 3, t-test, ** p<0.01). C. comparison of relative expression of miR149 in poorly, moderately and highly differentiated human gastric cancer clinical samples. (The values indicate the mean ±SEM, n = 3, One-way ANOVA analysis, F = 65.391, *** p<0.001). In order to determine if levels of miR-149 also correlate with the differentiation degree of tumors we examined the expression of miR-149 in 44 human GC clinical specimens, including 13 poorly, 16 moderately, and 15 well differentiated samples. We found that the expression of miR-149 in gastric tumors is remarkably lower than in matched normal adjacent tissues (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the expression of miR-149 in more differentiated tumors was higher than in less differentiated tumors (Fig. 1C, F = 65.391, p<0.001). In addition, decreased expression of miR-149 correlates with lymph node metastasis (*p = 0.046) and TNM stage (**p = 0.0011) (Table 1).10.1371/journal.pone.0041693.t001Table 1The relationship between clinical parameters and miR-149 (Mean±SE) expression in primary gastric adenocarcinoma.Clinical parametersN(%)Relative expressionp-valueAge(years)≥6019(43)0.5326±0.027990.37<6025(57)0.4956±0.02878GenderMale32(73)0.5059±0.025070.65Female12(27)0.5267±0.03396Size≥526(59)0.5273±0.027680.36<518(41)0.4889±0.02948Histologic differentiationWell(W)13(30)0.6500±0.02048Moderately(M)16(36)0.5388±0.01549P: <0.001***Poorly (P)15(34)0.3627±0.01733Lymphatic metastasisNo13(30)0.5738±0.041390.046*Yes31(70)0.4855±0.02177TNM stageStage I/II20(45)0.5810±0.027960.0011*Stage III/IV24(55)0.4538±0.02354Ectopic expression of miR-149 inhibits proliferation and induces G0/G1 arrest in AGS and SGC7901 cells To investigate the role of miR-149 in GC cells, we utilized poorly and moderately differentiated GC cell lines, AGS and SGC7901, respectively. AGS and SGC7901 cells were transiently transfected with eithermature miR-149 mimics, inhibitor, mock transfected, or miR-NC. As shown in figure 2A, 2D, quantitative RT-PCR results show that expression of miR-149 mimics or inhibitors significantly upregulate or downregulate the expression of miR-149, respectively, in AGS and SGC7901 cells from the first to fifth day posttransfection (Fig. 2A, F = 8.429, p = 0.003; fig. 2D, F = 8.595, p = 0.003) compared to NC and mock controls.10.1371/journal.pone.0041693.g002Figure 2Expression of miR149 inhibits proliferation and induces G0/G1 arrest of GC cell lines. A&D. The level of miR149 was measured by quantitative PCR at designated time (One-way ANOVA analysis, the values indicate the mean ± SEM, fig. 2A, F = 8.429, p = 0.003; fig. 2D, F = 8.595, p = 0.003). B&E. GC cells transfected with miR-149 mimics and inhibitor subjected to MTT assay daily for 6 days (Two-way ANOVA analysis, fig. 2B, F = 27.47, p<0.001; Fig. 2E, F = 44.061, p<0.001). C&F. GC cells cells transfected with miR-149 mimics and inhibitor were collected for FACS analysis after 72 h (The values indicate the mean ± SEM, n = 3, One-way ANOVA, fig. 2C, F = 134.177, p<0.001; Fig. F, F = 58.792, p = 0.003). AGS and SGC7901 cells transfected with miR-149 mimics and inhibitors showed significantly lower and higher levels of cell proliferation, respectively, than the NC or mock groups as determined by MTT assay (Fig. 2B, F = 27.47, p<0.001; Fig. 2E, F = 44.061, p<0.001). Transfection of AGS and SGC7901 cells with miR-149 mimics results in significant G1 phase arrest in comparison to NC and mock controls (p<0.05). Moreover, treatment with miR-149 inhibitors led to fewer AGS and SGC7901 cells in G1 arrest compared to NC and mock controls (p<0.05) (Fig. 2C, F = 134.177, p<0.001; Fig. 2F, F = 58.792, p = 0.003).ZBTB2 is a target of miR-149 Previous data suggest that miR-149 might be a suppressor of GC cell growth by targeting genes that control proliferation and cell cycle progression (33–34)(38). Thus, we searched for additional potential targets of miR-149 from TargetScanHuman database. We identified numerous potential miR-149 target genes, including ZBTB2, a POK family transcription factor and potent repressor of the ARF-HDM2-p53-p21 pathway(41). ZBTB2 was found to have putative miR-149 binding sites within its 3′UTR (Fig. 3A). Luciferase reporter assays were performed to verify whether ZBTB2 is a direct target of miR-149 using AGS and SGC7901 cells. We co-transfected AGS and SGC7901 cells respectively with a psiCHECK-2 vector containing either 3′UTR for ZBTB2 or mutated 3′UTR for ZBTB2, and mimics of miR-149 or inhibitors of miR-149. Wild-type and mutant ZBTB2-3′UTR containing the putative binding site of miR-149 were cloned into psiCHECK-2 vector downstream from luciferase gene (Fig. S1). Introduction of miR-149 significantly reduced the luciferase activity from the ZBTB2 3′UTR reporter vector (Fig. 3B–3C, p<0.001), but did not affect the luciferase activity from the mutant ZBTB2-3′UTR reporter vector. These data suggest that miR-149 directly regulates ZBTB2 expression levels. Furthermore, there is no significant decrease in relative luciferase activity in cells co-transfected with miR-149 inhibitor or 3′UTR-ZBTB2/psiCHECK-2 vector (Fig. 3B–3C). It is maybe because of the lack of interaction between 3′UTR of ZBTB2 and endogenous miR-149, hence, decreased miR-149 expression did not increase luciferase activity from the ZBTB2-3′UTR reporter vector. These results further confirm that miR-149 suppresses ZBTB2 expression by targeting the 3′-UTR of ZBTB2 mRNA.10.1371/journal.pone.0041693.g003Figure 3Validating the predicted binding sites between miR149 and ZBTB2. A. The schematic diagram shows the construct of Luc-ZBTB2 3′UTR and Luc-ZBTB2 3′Mut UTR.Both Luc-ZBTB2 3′UTR and Luc-ZBTB2 3′Mut UTR were cloned into a pmirGLO plasmid downstream of the firefly luciferase coding region between the PmeI and XbaI sites. B&C. AGS cells (B) or SGC7901 cells(C) were co-transfected with the psiCHECK-2 constructs containing either ZBTB2 3′UTR or ZBTB2 3′Mut UTR and either the miR-149 inhibitor or the miR-149 mimics for 48 h. Values indicate the relative luciferase activity after normalization to Renilla luciferase activity(The values indicate the mean ± SEM, n = 3, One-way ANOVA analysis,**p<0.01).miR-149 and ZBTB2 expression is negatively correlated in GC cells and clinical samples To further investigate the relationship between miR-149 and ZBTB2, we examined the expression of ZBTB2 in GC cells using western blotting and in GC tissues using immunohistochemistry. It was found that GC cells have significantly higher expression level of ZBTB2 than the normal gastric epithelial cell, GES-1 (Fig. 4A a–b F = 167.843, p<0.001). ZBTB2 expression negatively correlated with the differentiation degree of the GC cells; poorly differentiated GC tissues showed a significant higher ZBTB2 expression level than well differentiated GC tissues and matched normal gastric tissues (Fig. S2A–B, F = 117.280, p<0.001). ZBTB2 mRNA expression levels are coincident with the protein levels (Fig. 4B a, F = 283.355, p<0.001). Furthermore, the expression of miR-149 and ZBTB2 is inversely correlated (Fig. 4B b, p = 0.033, R = −0.908). We then measured the expression levels of miR-149 and ZBTB2 using quantitative RT-PCR in 5 GC cell lines (MKN45, GC9811, AGS, SGC7901, and MKN28) (Fig. 4C a) and 18 GC clinical samples (6 poorly, 6 moderately, and 6 well differentiated samples) (Fig. 4C b). Results confirm that the mRNA level of ZBTB2 negatively correlates with miR-149 expression (Fig. 4C a, p = 0.033, R = −0.847; Fig. 4C b, p<0.001, R = −0.908). Moreover, AGS (Fig. 4D) and SGC7901 cells (Fig. 4E) transfected with miR-149 mimics have significantly decreased expression of ZBTB2 at the protein levels (panels a–b) and mRNA levels (panel c) compared to mock or NC cells (p<0.001). Our findings indicate that miR-149 may directly regulate the expression of ZBTB2.10.1371/journal.pone.0041693.g004Figure 4Expression of miR-149 and ZBTB2 negatively correlate in GC cell lines and clinical samples.

ZBTB2 expression was knocked-down using siRNAs in AGS and SGC7901 cells. Western blotting (Fig. 5A, a–c) and quantitative PCR analysis showed that depletion of ZBTB2 by siRNA transfection could be compensated significantly by miR-149 inhibitor and a marked increase of ZBTB2 was seen in cells transfected with miR-149 inhibitors(Fig. 5B, p<0.001). MTT assay shows that proliferation of cells transfected with siRNA-ZBTB2 was suppressed and the proliferation of cells transfected with miR-149 inhibitors increased significantly compared to cells transfected with siRNA-NC (control) and siRNA-ZBTB2+miR-149 (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, inhibition of ZBTB2 expression promotes G0/G1 arrest and suppresses the G0/G1 cell cycle arrest induced by miR-149 inhibitor treatment in AGS and SGC7901 cells compared to NC control cells (Fig. 5D–5E, p<0.001). Our findings suggest that miR-149 inhibits GC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by inhibiting ZBTB2 expression.10.1371/journal.pone.0041693.g005Figure 5ZBTB2 mediates the function of miR-149 by suppressing GC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression.

D. GC cells transfected cells treated with siRNA-NC, siRNA-ZBTB2, miR-149 inhibitor+siRNA-ZBTB2,or miR-149 inhibitor were collected for FACS analysis after 72 h(the values indicate the mean ± SEM, n = 3, *, p<0.05;** p<0.01;*** p<0.001).Introduction of miR-149 altered the expression of ZBTB2 and cell-cycle-related proteins ZBTB2 has been reported to be a potent repressor of the ARF-HDM2-p53-p21 pathway, which is important in cell cycle regulation (41). To investigate the regulation of these proteins by miR-149 in GC cells, we transfected AGS and SGC7901 cells with miR-149 mimics or miR-NC and performed RT-PCR and western blotting analysis for ZBTB2 target genes. As shown in Figure 6A–6B, ectopic expression of miR-149 downregulates the expression of ZBTB and HDM2, and upregulates the expression of ARF, p53, and p21 (p<0.001). These data are consistent with the function of ZBTB2 in repressing the transcription of ARF, p53, and p21 and activating the expression of HDM2(41). Moreover, ectopic expression of ZBTB2 by transfection reversed the miR-149-mediated reduction in HDM2 expression and increase in ARF, p53, and p21 expression in AGS and SGC7901 cells (Fig. 6A–B). Ectopic ZBTB2 expression was confirmed in transfected AGS and SGC7901 cells (Fig. S3, SGC7901 cells, F = 806.365, p<0.001; AGS cells, F = 1436.300, p<0.001). ARF, p53 and p21 promote cell cycle progression therefore, their downregulation by expression of miR-149 mimics explains the G0/G1 phase arrest in AGS and SGC7901 cells.10.1371/journal.pone.0041693.g006Figure 6Expression of miR-149 alters the expression of ZBTB2 and cell-cycle-related proteins.

Altered miRNA expression levels have been implicated in the initiation and development of tumors; modulation of miRNAs that function as negative regulators of oncogenes or tumor suppressors results in promotion of cancer cell proliferation and growth [28]–[32]. Previous studies have shown that the role of miR-149 in the progression of various types of tumors is controversial [33]–[36], [38]. The expression pattern and targets of miR-149 vary in different types of tumors. miR-149 expression is downregulated in some tumors, functioning as a tumor suppressor by targeting oncogenes in some cancers. For example, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma miR-149 is downregulated and its likely targets were identified as KCNMA1 and LOX(35). Furthermore, miR-149 is also downregulated in glioblastoma cells and has been proposed to act as a tumor suppressor by targeting RAP1B, CD47, CCN1, and NXF1 [36]. In contrast, miR-149 can also function as a tumor suppressor by targeting certain oncogenes. Detection of miRNA expression profiles in different clinical stages of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and NPC lymph node metastasis shows that the expression of miR-149 is upregulated in NPC and expression of its target gene, Smad2, is decreased with the progression of NPC [38]. A similar oncogenic role for miR-149 was also seen in melanoma in which upregulation of miR-149 causes downregulation of GSK3-α and upregulation of Mcl-1, resulting in apoptotic resistance [34]. Thus far, little is known about the role of miR-149 in gastric cancer. Here, we report that miR-149 expression is remarkably reduced in multiple gastric cancer cell lines and clinical specimens compared with the normal gastric epithelial cell and matched adjacent normal tissues, respectively. Importantly, the level of miR-149 expression is associated with the differentiation degree of GC cells and specimens; poorly differentiated GC cells or specimens have lower miR-149 expression compared to well differentiated samples. Ectopic expression of miR-149 inhibits cells proliferation and cell cycle progression by targeting ZBTB2 in AGS and SGC7901 cells. miR-149 and ZBTB2 expression are negatively correlated in GC cells and clinical specimens, and overexpression of miR-149 causes downregulation of ZBTB2. Depletion of ZBTB2 results in inhibition of AGS and SGC7901 cells proliferation and cell cycle progression. Collectively, these results demonstrate, for the first time, that ZBTB2 may function as an oncogene in the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer. Our data show that introduction of miR-149 into GC cells induces cell cycle arrest, suggesting that miR-149 targets may be implicated in cell cycle regulation. ZBTB2 is a POK family transcription factor which can suppress the ARF-HDM2-p53-p21 pathway [41]. ARF, a tumor suppressor [42], can be induced by sustained mitogenic stimulation and plays a key role in activating p53 independently and controlling the stability of p53 through interaction with HDM2 [43], an important regulator of p53. The tumor suppressor p53 plays a critical role in the maintenance of cell homeostasis through inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis when cells are subjected to stressors, such as hypoxia, DNA damage, and telomere dysfunction [44]. p21, a p53 target gene, mediates cell cycle G1 phase arrest through binding and inhibiting the activity of cyclin-CDK2 or CDK1 complexes [45]. ZBTB2 can repress the transcription of ARF, p53, and p21, and induce HDM2 expression [41]. To validate whether the cell cycle effects induced by miR-149 expression is mediated by ZBTB2 loss, we examined expression of HDM2, ARF, p53 and p21 of AGS and SGC7901 cells transfected with miR-149 mimics. We found that ectopic expression of miR-149 results in increased expression of ARF, p53, and p21 and decreased expression of HDM2 and ZBTB2. These results support the idea that miR-149 exerts its role of inhibiting GC cells proliferation and cell cycle progression by targeting ZBTB2 thereby modulating the expression of downstream regulators of cell cycle progression. In summary, our data indicate that miR-149 may function as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer cells and plays an important role in inhibiting ZBTB2. Therefore, downregulation of miR-149 promotes GC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Moreover, our results show that ZBTB2 may function as an oncogene in the development of gastric cancer. However, given the fact that each miRNA may regulate many target genes which can affect carcinogenesis in different ways, more studies are needed to investigate other miR-149 targets which may have critical roles in GC tumorigenesis. The present study also provides novel insight into the role of miR-149 in human gastric cancer progression and indicates that miR-149 may serve as a therapeutic target for gastric cancer treatment.Materials and MethodsEthics Statement For tissue samples, written informed consent was obtained from patients.

Cells were transfected with the miR-149 mimics, NC and pmirGLO plasmid in 24-well plates using lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions. 48 h later, cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, USA) and detected by the GloMaxTM 20/20 detection system (E5331, Promega).Western blotting Total protein from cultured cells were lysed by Lysis Buffer containing PMSF on ice. Then protein were electrophoresed through 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels and were then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk powder at room temperature for 1 h and incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies labeled with HRP for 1 h at room temperature after three 10 min washes in TBS-T(triethanolaminebuffered saline solution with Tween). Finally, the signals were detected using ECL kit (Pierce Biotech., Rockford, IL, USA) and the membranes were scanned and analyzed using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+ imaging system with imaging software (version quantity 1). The protein expression was normalized to an endogenous reference (Actin) and relative to the control. The Spectra multicolor broad-range protein ladder (Fermentas) was used as molecular marker. All the antibodies used in western blot assay are listed in table S1.Immunohistochemistry and Immunohistochemical scoring Paraffin sections, 4-µm in thickness, were baked for 2 h at 65°C and deparaffinized. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate sodium buffer (PH 7.2) at 95°C for 15 minutes and then slides were cooled at room temperature for 30 minutes. After being treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 minutes to block the endogenous peroxidase, the sections were treated with normal goat serum confining liquid for 30 minutes to reduce non-specific binding and then rabbit polyclonal anti-ZBTB2 (1∶500, Bioss Co. China) was incubated the sections for 12 h at 4°C.After rewarming for 1 h and washing for 5 times, sections were incubated with secondary antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature. Diaminobenzidine(DAB) was used for color reactions. Subsequent immunohistochemical staining was scored as previously described [46].MTT assay Cells were transfected with 100 nM miR-149 inhibitor (Genepharma,Shanghai,China),mimics(Ribobio,Guangzhou,Guangdong,China) or 100 nM siRNA-ZBTB2 (Genepharma).Twenty-four later, cells were seeded in 96-well plates(2×103/well). The viability of cells was examined by MTT (3-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay (Sigma,USA) daily for 6 days.Cell cycle assay by flow cytometry Gastric cancer cell lines, AGS and SGC7901 were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS in 6-well plates. Transfection were performed when cells reached 80%%–90% confluency. Subsequently, cells were harvested, washed twice using PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4°C overnight. Then cells were incubated with propidium iodide at room temperature for 1 h and were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). These data were analyzed by using Flowjo (Flowjo).Statistical analysis Data were expressed as Mean±SEM of three independent experiments. For statistical tests, SPSS statistical software package, version17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used. The student's t-test, the one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA test were performed for MTT assays, quantitative PCR and tumor growth curve. The correlation between miR-149 and ZBTB2 was analyzed with Spearman rank correlation. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Wild-type and mutant ZBTB2-3′UTR containing the putative binding site of miR-149 were cloned into psiCHECK-2 vector.

Database URL: PTM-SD can be accessed at . Introduction The residues in a protein can undergo covalent and chemical modifications, which are usually called posttranslational modifications (PTMs). The concept of PTMs encompasses different types of modifications from a simple addition of atoms group such as the phosphorylation, e.g. done by Tyrosine kinase (1), to the binding of important large groups, e.g. the retinal in the bacteriorhodopsin (2). PTMs play important roles in modulating various biological functions by altering the physical and chemical properties, the localization and activity of proteins. They are also linked to multiple diseases, e.g. in nuclear receptors (3), in the regulation of metabolism (4) or in signal integration (5). Some modifications are specific to one kind of organism, as pupylation in prokaryotes (6), or particular types of residues, as mainly serine and threonine for O-linked glycosylation or S-nitrosylation for Cysteine. The available data on PTMs increased drastically in the recent years because of the improvements of mass spectrometry-based detection methods (7). To simplify the analysis of complex PTM data and to enhance our understanding of various PTMs in different organism, many databases, software and tools have been developed. They are in general specific to some PTM types and/or specific to organism (8,9). Recent studies have shown that PTMs have significant effects on the protein conformations and on their flexibility (10–12). Current databases contain crucial sequence annotation but do not provide valuable resource on the 3D structure related to these PTMs (13). In general, the available structural data refer to the protein chain for which PTMs are annotated, regardless of modifications are present in the solved structure. So far, few databases, such as dbPTM (14), PTMcode (15) and Phospho3D (16), use information from protein structures. dbPTM is an interesting database, which accumulates the biological information related to PTM, such as the catalytic sites, structural information, solvent accessibility of residues, protein secondary structures, protein domain and protein variations (14). The main objective of dbPTM is to summarize all experimental information on PTM as sequence analysis and prediction methodology. PTMcode presents the functional associations between 13 different PTM types within proteins in 8 eukaryotic species (15). The structural data consists of mapped PTM residues to 3D structures of proteins from the Protein Data Bank (17), which do not always correspond to modified residues. Phospho3D, as many databases, is specific to one type of PTM and provides 3D structures of phosphorylation sites according to the annotations of the phospho.ELM database (18). The database also collects the results of a large-scale structural comparison procedure providing clues for the identification of new putative phosphorylation sites. Current databases do not underline PTMs in the protein structures context owing to the difficult identification of resolved PTMs in the PDB files. Posttranslational modification structural database (PTM-SD) provides access to structurally solved modified residues, which are also experimentally annotated as PTMs. It gives valuable information on PTMs in the context of global and local protein conformation (19), and also particular details for each PTM observed in protein 3D structure. The proper availability of these data could be of great interest for studying sequence–structure–function relationships at the light of PTMs, which are often forgotten. It could also be useful and provide insights for comparative modeling and PTM predictions protocols. PTM-SD can be accessed at http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/PTM-SD/.Materials and Methods PTM-SD entry consists of structurally resolved and experimentally annotated PTMs in proteins structures. Flowchart in Figure 1 explains the principles of the database. The major problem encountered in building this database was the detection of PTMs in the PDB structures. At this time, no efficient query can be done on RCSB Protein Data Bank (17) to select easily and exclusively protein structures containing solved PTMs. Searching for specific PTM keywords could lead to structure of enzymes implicated in modifications. By using the advanced search, the RCSB PDB returns, as on 22 January 2014, a total of 17 767 structures of proteins, peptides and protein/nucleic acid complexes containing at least one modified residue. These modified residues are not all related to PTMs, and could correspond to protein engineering. Figure 1. PTM-SD flowchart. Four different databanks are used to generate the data. The protein structures are taken from PDB (17), while PTMs annotations are extracted from dbPTM (14) and PTMCuration (20). UniProt sequences (21) are aligned against the extracted PDB sequences. Thus, we obtained protein structures with PTM annotations and modified residues at exact same positions. At last a semantic mining was made to accept or not the correspondence between the modifications and the annotations. To build our database, we proceed step-by-step. Firstly, we selected protein structures containing modified residues (indicated in PDB files with the MODRES records) with available PTM annotations. These last were extracted from dbPTM (14) and PTMCuration (20). Only experimentally verified annotations were selected. Secondly, we verified, in the selected structures, that the numbering of modified residues corresponds to the position of annotations in sequence. Residue numbering from PDB does not necessarily follow the amino-acid positions in the corresponding protein sequence. The first idea was to extract the sequence from PDB and align it with the UniProt sequence. The extraction of sequence from PDB could be difficult for many reasons: numbering in PDB may not be continuous because of the insertion of residue (numbering for example 100-100A-100B-103) or insertion of protein fragment (like lysozyme in PDB structure 2RH1), the structure could contain missing residues, gaps (but not necessarily along with gaps in numbering), mutations could be present and the residue names could be different from the 20 standard amino acids. Additionally, different PTMs can be annotated to the same sequence position; therefore, some disagreements between the structure of the PTMs in the PDB and annotations in dbPTM were observed (see the example ‘N-trimethyllysine’ in position 4 of PDB 3N9L chain B, which is also found annotated as ‘N6-acetyllysine’. http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_ too ls/ PTM-SD/ request_ details.php?pdb_id=3N9L&p db_ ch ain=B&pdb_pos=4). Finally, the last step was to deal with ‘incompatibilities’ encountered between PTMs annotations, MODRES PDB records and chemical structures of the modified residues. PTMs are associated with a large variety of chemical groups and can be described with unusual residue names and atom names. Based on the wwPDB Format Documentation (the Contents Guide Version 3.30, 21 November 2012) and the Section A, wwPDB processing procedures (January 2014 Version 2.7), a modified residue is annotated in MODRES record and could be described in two ways. If the modification was made by a chemical group greater than 10 atoms, the modified residue will be split into two groups: the amino acid atoms (defined in ATOM record) and the modification atoms (defined in HETATM record) grouped in a ‘hetero group’ and indicated in HET records. The covalent bond between these two groups is indicated in the LINK record. In a second way, if the modification involves 10 atoms or lower, all the atoms are grouped into a ‘hetero-group’. For example, in the Chain B of PDB 1J2E, the Asn 85 is glycosylated (N-linked). As seen at the bottom of its ‘detail page’ (http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/PTM-SD/request_ details.php?pdb_ id=1J2E&pdb_chain= B& pdb_ pos =85), the coordinate information of the atoms of Asn 85 are given in the ATOM PDB record, and all the coordinate information of the sugar are indicated in HETATM PDB record. In a different way, the Thr 160 of the chain C in the PDB 2UZB is annotated as phosphorylated (see http://www.dsimb . inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/PTM-SD/ request_ det a ils. php?pdb_ id=2UZB&pdb_chain= C&pdb_pos=160). In MODRES record, the residue name THR are replaced by TPO and all the coordinate information are given in the HETATM record, grouping together the phosphate atoms (P/OP1/OP2/OP3), the side chain atoms (CB/OG1/CG2) and the backbone atoms (N/CA/C/O). In this case, the covalent links indicated in LINK records refer to the polypeptide links with the previous and next residues in the polypeptide chain. Hence, the consistency of these three information (PTMs annotations, MODRES PDB records and chemical structures) was checked by automatic and manual refinement, using extracted data from the PDB files and a correspondence annotation table (http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/PTM-SD/correspondence_table.html). In summary, a mapping was made, through the UniProt accession number (Uniprot AC) (21), between the annotation databases (PTMCuration, dbPTM) and the PDB. The obtained structures were automatically and manually inspected to validate the annotations in terms of position and chemical structure. Extraction of structural data from PDB file (as sequence, missing information) was done with in-house scripts. Secondary structures were assigned using the most popular method, DSSP (22). It assigns the secondary structures by particular hydrogen-bond patterns detected from the protein geometry and an electrostatic model. DSSP is the tool used by the PDB to assign secondary structure. It defines three kinds of helices (α, π and 310), β-sheet, β-bridge, two kinds of turns (hydrogen-bonded turns and non–hydrogen-bonded bend) and the remaining is considered as a coil. Next, we assigned Protein Blocks (PBs) (23). This structural alphabet is composed of 16 local structure prototypes of five residues in length. They efficiently approximate every part of protein structures. The PBs m and d can be roughly described as prototypes for the central region of α-helix and β-strand, respectively. PBs a through c primarily represent the N-cap of β-strand, whereas e and f correspond to C-caps; PBs g through j are specific to coils, PBs k and l correspond to N cap of α –helix and PBs n through p to C-caps. They have been used in various approaches, for example in protein superimposition (24,25), and for the analysis (26,27) or prediction (28,29) of protein binding sites. PB assignment was done with a slightly modified Python PBxplore tool (https://github.com/pierrepo/PBxplore). The equivalent number of PBs (Neq) is a statistical measurement similar to an entropy and represents the average number of PBs a given residue takes (23). Neq is calculated as follows: Where fx is the observed frequency of PB x. A Neq value of 1 indicates that only one type of PB is observed, while a value of 16 is equivalent to a random distribution. The 3D structure representation is generated using PyMOL software (http://www.pymol.org).ResultsStatistics On 22 January 2014, PTM-SD consisted of 10 628 entries. It corresponds to 842 Uniprot AC, 2986 PDB files and 5350 PDB chains containing at least one modified position. Twenty-one different kinds of PTMs were detected, 11 with >50 occurrences (see Table 1). As expected, the most important one is glycosylation (60.09%), followed by phosphorylation (15.23%) and methylation (8.10%). Two hundred six different organisms are present, with an overrepresentation of Human (44.27%), and other mammals, e.g. mouse (7.98%), bovine (7.79%), pig (1.64%) and rat (1.52%). Green alga (5.84%) and chicken (2.71%) are also well represented. Table 1.

Surprisingly, the turns (hydrogen and non-hydrogen bonded) are highly overrepresented (30.68%), whereas the classical α helix is seen only 11.18%, which is low (the average frequency of α helix in proteins is 30%). PTMs in structural data are not precisely recorded, making their identification difficult (see ‘Material and Methods’ section). Discordance between UniProt position and PDB residue numbering is observed in 51% of PTM-SD entries. The atom coordinates, backbone atoms included, of 27% of PTM-SD entries are recorded in the HETATM PDB records, which are usually reserved for molecules that are not part of a biological polymer (as prosthetic groups, inhibitor, solvent molecules and ions). As far as, in PTM-SD, 38% of entries described in PDB files have a different three-letter code known for the 20 classical amino acids; e.g. threonine known as THR is named TPO in case of phosphorylation, or lysine known as LYS is defined as M3L in case of trimethylation.Browse PTM-SDGeneral search The data can be explored using two search modes: (i) the simple mode (Figure 2A) and (ii) the advanced mode (Figure 2B). The first one allows searching the PTMs by PDB id(s), and by UniProt accession number(s) and then filtering according to the classic PTM annotation (21 different kinds of PTMs are proposed at this level), and specific organisms; both short name and more common one are given, e.g. ACAGO (Tarantula spider). Multiple choices can be done, and all criteria can be combined to complete more complex queries. The advanced mode adds more precise criteria. A dedicated research can be done with selecting specific amino acid types, secondary structures, SCOP class classification (30), protein length, as well as number of PTMs observed in PDB chain. Additionally two detailed annotations are provided, which came directly from the PDB MODRES records and dbPTM fields. The results are provided as a Table under the search area (Figure 2C) in which each line corresponds to one PTM-SD entry, i.e. one PTM experimentally annotated and structurally solved. Figure 2. Example of PTM-SD usage. (A) A simple mode is available to use PTM-SD. It is possible to look for a list of PDB and/or UniProt ids, combined with a specific organism and (a) particular PTM(s). (B) An advanced mode allows more complex requests, as specific amino acid(s), secondary structure(s), SCOP fold(s), number of PTM by PDB chain, length of PDB chain and detailed annotation(s) found in PDB records and dbPTM. By clicking on the search button, (C) a results table appears. It gives for each entry the information on organism, cross-linking with the PDB and UniProt id, the precise position of the PTM in sequence and structural data, PTM annotations and its structural environment in terms of PBs and secondary structures. (D) By clicking on the ‘details’ link, the visitor is redirected to a new page containing extra information on the selected PTM site. Related PTM-SD entries found in same PDB chain and same UniProt AC are accessible through cross-link. Image gallery was done, thanks to PyMOL software, and below alignment section, done thanks to Clustal W, allows direct observation of the sequence/structure relationship surrounding PTM sites. On this page, scripts for PyMOL software and template sequence for Modeller comparative software are provided. (E) From the complete set of selected entries, it is possible to look at the distribution of organisms, proteins, PDB ids/chains and PTM types. Neq entropy index quantifies the local structural divergences between the PTMs. From this step, the visitor can reduce the protein redundancy into his selected entries. (F) At last he can download the list of PDB chain and the PTM-SD data related to his selection.Details The results are given in the table, for each line, the organism, the UniProt AC, the PDB and chain identifiers. Additionally, the specific annotation found in MODRES PDB record and the dbPTM annotation(s) with their corresponding position are provided, as they can differ. For instance, the methylation observed on residue 4 in the histone demethylase ceKDM7A [PDB code 3N9L chain B, (31)] is defined in the MODRES PDB record as ‘N-TRIMETHYLLYSINE’. At the corresponding position in the protein sequence (Lysine 5 in P08898), four different annotations are found in dbPTM: N6-methyllysine, N6, N6-dimethyllysine, N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine and N6-acetyllysine. The SCOP class of the PDB chain, the amino acid corresponding to the PTM site position in the protein sequence and the assignments of PBs and secondary structure in the vicinity of the PTM site are also given. The PTM site is colored in purple to locate it easily. For each entry, cross-links to PDB and UniProt Web sites are provided. Finally, a ‘details’ link for each entry is provided. By clicking on it, users will be redirected to a dedicated webpage (Figure 2D) where all PTMs annotations found in dbPTM related for this specific position are available. Related PTM-SD entries are given for other positions on the protein chains and for the same UniProt AC. Sometimes, a huge number can be found, like the glycosylation observed on position 150 in the chain A of the human dipeptidyl peptidase IV [PDB code 1TK3 (32)], which has six related PTM-SD entries on the same chain and 667 on the same UniProt AC. In the same, below the various information, the visitor can find useful aligned information, which allows the analyses of PTMs in the sequence and structural context simultaneously. An alignment between the sequence from protein structure and the sequence from UniProt was performed by ClustalW 2.0.12 (33) and symbols for similarity/identity of positions are showed. A sequence representing the extracted information from PDB records is also aligned emphasizing discrepancies, missing residues, inserted residues and residues for which all the atoms are defined in HETATM records. Additionally, sequences of secondary structure and PBs assignments are also aligned. On the current ‘details’ page, the selected PTM position is highlighted in purple, whereas the other PTM sites found in the PDB chain are colored in yellow. The PTM position found in other PDB chain are highlighted in green. To help the visitor to explore the 3D structure, the PyMOL script used to compute the PTM gallery is also provided. Please note that the PTMs are highlighted in the same color as in the aligned information. Finally, extracted data are given from the PDB file, corresponding to the modified residues, and a sequence that could be directly used to perform comparative modeling with Modeller software (34).PTM-SD tools/specific dataset creation After selecting entries from the results table, the visitor has access to three tools (namely ‘Statistics’, ‘Neq’ and ‘Clustering’) developed to make a quick analysis of the PTMs selection and to facilitate the creation of specific PTMs dataset (Figure 2E). For instance, with the simple and advanced search, it is easy to define a set of protein structures. By using the ‘Statistics’ tool, the visitor can analyze the distribution of a PTM with regards to an organism, e.g. ‘Methylation’ is found in structures from 24 organisms, with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii being the most important one (33.91%). Similarly, the visitor can look at an organism and see which PTMs are found, e.g. three different PTMs are observed in rabbit proteins (Methylation, Phosphorylation and N-linked Glycosylation). By selecting ‘Methylation’ and ‘Rabbit’, 67 entries are found. The ‘Statistics’ tool shows that in fact these entries correspond to one annotation of methylation found in one UniProt AC, but solved in 35 PDB id codes and 67 PDB id chains. This methylation does not belong to only one local conformation, as showed by the ‘Neq’ tool, which is an entropy index based on the PB assignment at the vicinity of the PTMs site. At one position, if all the PBs are identical, Neq equals to 1, whereas if the 16 are seen equivalently, Neq equals to 16. For this PTM site, Neq equals to 1.79, underlining differences between local conformations; surprisingly, it is before the PTM that Neq equals to 1. At last, by using ‘Clustering’ tool, the visitor has the possibility to compute dendogram and histogram of pair-wise sequence identity between selected proteins. He could also reduce redundancy in his selected entries, thereby creating a nonredundant selection. For instance, the ‘Hydroxylation’ represents 34 UniProt AC for 64 PDB id codes, 165 PDB id chains and 314 PTM-SD entries. The use of a 30% threshold leads to deselect entries from the results table (Figure 2E). The related PTM-SD data and the list of PDB ids can be downloaded at the ‘create your dataset’ section (Figure 2F). These data could be of great interests for studying sequence–structure–function relationships at the light of PTMs. For example, users interested in studying the impact of phosphorylation in protein structure could easily browse the database and get access to all the phosphorylated residues solved in structure and experimentally annotated. By using the ‘Neq tool’ they could have a quick first analysis of the local conformation observed at the neighboring phosphorylation site. This type of analysis could be easily done again withmore precise criteria, as specific organisms or specific modified amino acids. Then by using the ‘Clustering tool’ they could create, and later download, a nonredundant data set, which will be the base of work for extraction of structural descriptors needed in a classic phosphorylation prediction protocols. Similarly, users motivated by comparative modeling could use the database to select protein structures associated with specific experimentally annotated PTMs. By using the extracted data from PDB, and the clean sequence given for Modeller software, which are available in ‘detail page’ of each entry, they have the necessary data to compute protein model containing PTMs.Implementation PTM-SD is developed and maintained using MySQL. All data extraction, treatment and update are carried out with Python scripts. The front-end interface was developed in HTML/PHP and animated using JavaScript/jQuery. The interactive graphics and flowcharts are generated using the JavaScript charting library Highcharts 3.0 (www.high charts.com). The clustering is computed using ‘hclust’ and ‘cutree’ functions of the R statistical software, version 2.15 (http://cran.r-project.org/). All gallery illustrations were rendered using the molecular visualization software PyMOL 1.5.Update PTM-SD is regularly updated in two steps. The structural data are updated weekly, immediately after the PDB updates, and the annotations data are updated each month.Discussion Structural data are limited in PTMs databases, e.g. in dbPTM (14), Phospho3D (16) or PTMcode (15). It mainly corresponds to secondary structure or solvent accessibility predictions. The available 3D representation of proteins is present only for visualization purposes. It facilitates the investigation of structural characteristics surrounding the PTM sites regardless to the real presence of the annotated PTMs. Other databases give access to the structure of the modification itself, but out of the protein fold context, e.g. RESID (35), BCSDB/Glycoscience (36) or GlycomeDB (37). Some databases provide cross-linking or id mapping from the PDB where annotated PTMs are resolved; however, they are specific to one PTM type of organism, e.g. Glycan Fragment DB (38), O-GLYCBASE (39) and ProGlycProt (40). PTM-SD is the only structural database that is generic to numerous PTMs in PDB structures and also underlines the complex case of many PTMs, i.e. structure discrepancies or multiple PTMs annotation. It was designed as an easy-to-use tool to meet the needs of different scientific communities: for biologists interested by PTM data for specific proteins, or organisms, and for bioinformatician searching for structural criteria to take into account in structural studies or in modeling/prediction protocols. Our extensive analyses of structural data had revealed that (i) the number of PTMs in protein structures is not negligible, (ii) some PTMs are heterogeneous and difficult to access properly in the PDB files because they are not really protein materials, (iii) the annotation of the same modification can be different and (iv) more surprisingly, a PTM can be crystallized in the structure while annotated as a different type of PTM in other databases. PTM-SD gives an overview of the ensemble. In the future, it is planned to keep developing PTM-SD by adding filters related to structural data, as resolution, R-Factor, B-Factor, solvent accessibility, by giving direct access to the coordinate data of PTM atoms, and by providing other options for the clustering tool.

Introduction The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a complex ecosystem where many factors, biotic and abiotic, play essential roles in reaching and maintaining a homeostatic equilibrium. The gut is endowed with the most diverse and dense microbiota of the human body, which plays fundamental roles in gut maturation, angiogenesis, immune system modulation, digestion, and protection from pathogens [1], [2]. Given such important roles for health, the inter-individual variability of the human gut microbiota in adulthood and at any stage of development still defies our expectations. This variability is shocking in light of the ecological assumption that community composition and dynamics respond to and are structured mostly by the environment, “everything is everywhere but the environment selects” [3], [4]. The GIT environment, although subject to inter-individual variation in diet and physiological parameters such as motility and transit time, presents a number of physical, chemical and mechanical properties that are mostly similar across individuals, including temperature, pH and surface tension values bound within limited ranges [5]. Consequently, we would expect a substantial degree of inter-individual convergence of GIT bacterial communities as a response to common selective pressures. Therefore, many studies have concentrated their efforts in the detection of a taxonomic core that would be shared by all individuals [6]–[10]. In that this search has been difficult, this view has recently evolved towards defining a few types of compositional profiles for the GIT microbiota. For example, Arumugam et al. [11] have stipulated that there are three universally distributed clusters of well-balanced host-symbiont states named enterotypes, driven mainly by bacterial composition, and that every individual's microbiota pertains to one of these enterotypes. However, the existence of such well-defined clusters of microbiota composition has been contested because their detection is highly dependent on the methodology employed. Instead, Koren et al. [12] propose that gut microbiota composition across individuals is better represented by a series of gradients of taxon abundances that result in a bimodal distribution, where the ends of the spectrum harbor markedly different relative abundances of taxa. Moreover, theoretical and experimental community ecology indicate that different communities can assemble under identical selective pressures. With basis on the neutral theory of community ecology [13] and on the metacommunity concept [14], each human gut can be considered to harbor a local microbial community, the composition of which will be driven essentially by the stochastic processes associated with resampling from the metacommunity of all gut microbiotas to which it is linked by organismal dispersal. If there are limitations to the dispersal capacities of different species, such processes could result in the assemblage of substantially different communities in spite of the physical, chemical and mechanical characteristics shared by all guts. In addition, within the context of neutral theory, the functional equivalence hypothesis proposes that multiple species may possess similar functional attributes, and it has been shown that species-rich communities are particularly prone to the evolution of functionally equivalent species [15]. This functional equivalence hypothesis is appealing in regards to the inter-individual variation in composition of the GIT microbiota. Under functional equivalence, the taxonomically different assemblages in different individual guts could present similar overall functional profiles, so that the inter-individual variation would have no impact on the host. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic functional studies indicate that this scenario is plausible, since, in contrast to taxonomic variability, there seems to be conserved functional profiles among the microbiotas of different individuals [8], [16]–[18]. Furthermore, this adds to the growing consensus that ecological community structure and function are better described by functional diversity (i.e. diversity of species traits [19]) rather than by taxonomic diversity [20], and that it is the alteration of functional diversity that will perturb the functioning of the ecosystem. The latter is further strengthened for microbial communities, as quantitative gene content analysis reveals specific fingerprints characterizing particular environments in spite of the substantial number of shared essential functions among bacteria [21]. In the case of human-associated microbiotas on which the host relies for specific functions, the alteration of functional diversity within the community can affect health status. Following this, several metagenomic studies have emphasized assessment of the functional diversity present in the GIT microbiota of healthy individuals, so as to be able to detect potential deviations in individuals affected by different diseases [2], [8], [9], [22]–[25]. Most of these efforts have concentrated on adult individuals, while the assessment of functional capabilities in the GIT microbiota of infants has remained underexplored. However, infancy is the critical period for gut microbiota assembly, during which a constant dialogue with immune and metabolic development is established. Consequently, epidemiological and experimental lines of evidence indicate that the microbe-host interactions set in place during infancy represent a main determinant of life-long health or disease [26]–[28]. Despite its importance, the process of gut microbiota development in infants is still poorly understood, and has been mostly surveyed at the level of taxonomic succession by means of culture or of molecular analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene. These studies have shown that the differential exposure of the infant to vaginal, fecal and skin bacteria from the mother depending on the mode of birth (i.e., vaginal vs. C-section), as well as the type of feeding during the first months of life (i. e., breastmilk vs. formula), are main factors influencing the richness, diversity and composition of the gut microbial community [29]–[32]; that the earlier stages of infant gut microbiota development are characterized by high levels of inter-individual variability and a very uneven distribution of taxa; and that, as infant development progresses, microbial assemblages converge towards an adult-like composition with a more even taxa distribution [6], [33], [34]. On the other hand, to date, functional diversity in infants has mostly been explored in cross-sectional studies [23], [25], and in a few longitudinal studies that have been limited to one [16], [35] or a handful of infants [18]. It is important to keep in mind that cross-sectional studies do not follow individuals through time, but rather reflect single snapshots of the microbiota of different individuals of varying ages, and, therefore, cannot inform on the extent of inter-individual variation in microbiota dynamics. Thus far, the functional capabilities of the microbiota in infants have been shown to broadly mirror those of the mother from very early on, in spite of large taxonomic differences, although functions such as vitamin biosynthesis and xenobiotic degradation increase with time. However, much remains to be learnt about the process of functional development of the microbiota during colonization of an infant's GIT. Taking into account all of the above, the present study explores the patterns of taxonomic and functional change along time during GIT microbiota development in a birth cohort of 13 infants. With this aim, we have collected fecal samples from healthy infants throughout the first year of life, and have obtained metagenomic sequence to characterize the phylogenetic composition and genetic repertoire of the microbiota present in each sample. In addition, in order to assess the progression of the infant's microbiota towards an adult-like state, we have also collected and sequenced the microbiota present in the mother before and one-year after childbirth. Because we obtain both taxonomic and functional data, we can evaluate the functional development of the GIT microbiota and its interactions with taxonomic community assembly, in the context of the dietary and physiological changes that characterize the first year of life. Furthermore, because our analyses involve the prospective follow up of 13 infants, they allow us to evaluate several previously unexplored aspects of the GIT microbial succession process. Specifically, the availability of longitudinal data for several individuals sheds light on basic questions such as 1) whether taxonomic composition and functional development follow similar trends across individuals, 2) whether succession follows a strictly deterministic course, whereby early microbial assemblages set the stage for the next ones to come, 3) whether taxonomic variation among individuals during succession has an impact on the functional capabilities of the microbiota, and 4) whether community assembly is shaped by relationships of co-occurrence among taxa and how these evolve throughout succession. Overall, our data enable the characterization of microbial succession in the infant gut at unprecedented levels and, in particular, allow us to investigate whether the functional equivalence hypothesis can explain the inter-individual variability observed for this process.Results/DiscussionCohort, samples and sequencing Given that our goal was to investigate the inherent variation in the process of microbial succession in the gut, rather than the specific alterations caused by factors such as type of delivery or infant feeding, we recruited to the study women having healthy pregnancies and stating their intention to exclusively breastfeed their infants during at least three months. We initially recruited 21 women, all residents of the city of Valencia, who were contacted during midwife visits. Due to various factors, we were able to obtain series of 4–5 infant fecal samples during the first year for only 13 of the enrolled women. At the moment of delivery, these women were between 29 and 42 years of age and had not taken antibiotics in at least three months before the onset of labor. Seven women received antibiotic during delivery and an eighth woman did so during the first week after. All 13 infants were born at term (>37 weeks of gestation), ten of them by vaginal delivery and three by C-section. Nine infants were exclusively breastfed during at least three months, three received a few formula feedings during the first days of life, and one was partially breastfed during the first month and formula-fed thereafter (Table 1). In addition to fecal samples, throughout the 12-months sampling period we obtained information regarding the infants' diet, general health and intake of antibiotics and other drugs (Table 1, Table S1), by means of specifically designed questionnaires that were given to the infants' parents. This information allowed us to establish that all infants remained healthy throughout most of the sampling period and that solid foods were introduced into their diets between the 3- and 7-months samplings, following patterns typical of Spanish Mediterranean infant diets [36].10.1371/journal.pgen.1004406.t001Table 1Information regarding mothers and infants obtained from questionnaires answered by the infants' parents.SampleAgeSexDeliveryAntibiotics MotheraAntibiotics InfantDietMIP01-MA29--No--MIP01-I11 WeekMaleVaginal--Breast milkMIP01-I21 Month----Breast milkMIP01-I33 Months----Breast milkMIP01-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP01-I51 Year----Solid foodsMIP02-MA36--No--MIP02-I11 WeekFemaleVaginal--MixedMIP02-I21 Month----Breast milkMIP02-I33 Months----Breast milkMIP02-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP02-I51 Year----Solid foodsMIP03-MA30--No--MIP03-I11 WeekFemaleVaginalAmoxicillinOftalmowellbBreast milkMIP03-I21 Month--Amoxicillin-Breast milkMIP03-I33 Months--Cefuroxime-Breast milkMIP03-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP03-I51 Year--AmoxicillinCefuroximeSolid foodsMIP06-MA42--Amoxicillin--MIP06-I11 WeekFemaleC-section--Breast milkMIP06-I21 Month----Breast milkMIP06-I33 Months----Breast milkMIP06-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP06-I51 Year---AmoxicillinSolid foodsMIP07-MA31--Amoxicillin--MIP07-I11 WeekMaleC-section--Breast milkMIP07-I33 Months----Breast milkMIP07-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP07-I51 Year----Solid foodsMIP08-MA30--No--MIP08-I11 WeekFemaleVaginal--Breast milkMIP08-I21 Month----Breast milkMIP08-I33 Months----Breast milkMIP08-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP08-I51 Year----Solid foodsMIP09-MA30--No--MIP09-I11 WeekMaleVaginalAmoxicillin-MixedMIP09-I21 Month--Amoxicillin-MixedMIP09-I33 Months----FormulaMIP09-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP09-I51 Year----Solid foodsMIP12-MA31-Amoxicillin--MIP12-I11 WeekFemaleC-section--MixedMIP12-I21 Month----Breast milkMIP12-I33 Months--Cefixime-Breast milkMIP12-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP12-I51 Year----Solid foodsMIP13-MA31--Benzylpenicillin--MIP13-I11 WeekMaleVaginalAmoxicillin-MixedMIP13-I33 Months----Breast milkMIP13-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP13-I51 Year----Solid foodsMIP16-MA39--Amoxicillin--MIP16-I11 WeekMaleVaginal--Breast milkMIP16-I21 Month----Breast milkMIP16-I33 Months----Breast milkMIP16-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP16-I51 Year----Solid foodsMIP17-MA39--No--MIP17-I11 WeekMaleVaginal--Breast milkMIP17-I33 Months----Breast milkMIP17-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP17-I51 Year----Solid foodsMIP19-MA33--No--MIP19-I11 WeekFemaleVaginal--Breast milkMIP19-I33 Months----Breast milkMIP19-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP19-I51 Year----Solid foodsMIP21-MA35--Amoxicillin--MIP21-I11 WeekMaleVaginal--Breast milkMIP21-I21 Month----Breast milkMIP21-I33 Months----Breast milkMIP21-I47 Months----Solid foodsMIP21-I51 Year----Solid foods MIP: Mother Infant Pair.a For MA samples we report whether antibiotics were given during childbirth and the specific antibiotic given. In the case of C-sections, we report administration of amoxicillin, which is the standard practice in Spanish hospitals. None of the mothers had taken antibiotics before childbirth for at least three months.b Oftalmowell is a combination of gramicidin, neomycin and polymyxin B. Infant samples were collected at one week (I1), one month (I2), three months (I3, before introduction of solid foods), seven months (I4, after introduction of solid foods) and one year after birth (I5), and maternal samples were collected within one week prior to delivery (MA) and one year after (MB). We obtained 13 samples at each infant and maternal timepoint except for I2, for which only 9 samples were available, for an overall total of 87 samples that were processed for metagenomic pyrosequencing. After quality filtering, we obtained a total of 5,500,784 reads with a mean of 64,119 reads per sample and an average length of 348 bp (range 263–446 bp). For many reads, more than one Open Reading Frame (ORF) was recovered with a total of 9,968,776 ORFs and an average of 114,584 ORFs per sample. Annotation allowed for taxonomic assignment of 9,014,059 ORFs (103,610 per sample) and functional assignment of 675,141 ORFs (7760 per sample). Sequencing and annotation details as well as abundance tables for taxa and functions on a per sample basis are provided in the Supporting Information (Table S2, Table S3, Table S4). All sequences have been deposited in the IMG/M database [37] under the project name “Gut Microbiota of Spanish Mother-Infant Pairs”.The maternal microbiota changes between the perinatal period and one year after childbirth Several changes are detected between the mother's gut microbiota days before childbirth and that present one year later. MA samples show a higher taxonomic richness (p = 0.002), due to a higher representation of rare taxa (abundance under 1% in all samples), but their functional diversity is lower (p = 0.009), indicating that they are functionally more redundant than MB samples (Figure 1C–1F). In addition, in clustering analyses based on similarity of microbiota composition, arbitrary clustering patterns are obtained where the MA and MB samples of the same woman do not group together, neither for taxonomic nor for functional composition (Figure S1). MA samples also present a larger range of inter-individual variability at both the taxonomic and functional composition levels (Figure 2A, 2B). These changes suggest a decrease in the host's capacity to regulate microbiota composition and function during late pregnancy, perhaps related to the low-grade inflammation of GIT mucosal surfaces and to the other immune, physiologic, hormonal and metabolic changes that occur during this period. Moreover, our results are in agreement with the recent demonstration that the maternal gut microbiota is dramatically altered between the first and third trimesters of pregnancy [38].10.1371/journal.pgen.1004406.g001Figure 1Different behaviors of taxonomic and functional richness and diversity through infant gut microbiota development.

Values are centered at the mean of all samples and scaled by the standard deviation. Colored profile clusters have >95% support based on multiscale bootstrap resampling. The boxplots in (C) and (D) summarize the general behavior of taxon richness and diversity for all infants. Taxon richness (C) shows an increase in median values with time interrupted by the introduction of solid foods (I4), when a decrease in richness is observed. Taxon diversity (B) shows an increase in median values from I1 to I4 followed by a decrease between I4 and I5. Functional richness (E) and diversity (F) show no specific pattern but rather fluctuate with time.10.1371/journal.pgen.1004406.g002Figure 2ANOSIM comparison of timepoints.

Each timepoint is represented by a color and is linked by lines of this color to all timepoints from which it is not significantly different. For functional composition, significant differences appear between timepoints that are more separated in time, indicating directionality along infant development, but no such pattern is detected at the taxonomic level. The composition of the maternal GIT microbiota during the perinatal period could be of great importance to the microbial colonization of the infant. Although the in utero environment has been considered sterile under normal conditions [30], culture-dependent and 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analyses have detected microorganisms in human meconium, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord, even when no rupture of membranes has occurred and in elective Cesareans [39]–[44]. The suite of changes that occur during late pregnancy [45], [46] may facilitate the transport of maternal bacteria to the fetal GIT. In mice, translocation of live intestinal bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes increases in late pregnancy [47], [48], and dendritic cells have been shown to mediate increased bacterial translocation from the gut to blood and adipose tissue in obesity and diabetes [49], conditions similar to late pregnancy in terms of metabolic changes and the presence of a low-grade inflammatory state. Following translocation, intestinal bacteria could be transported in a controlled manner through lymph and blood, potentially reaching sites from which they could be transferred to the offspring, such as the placenta and the mammary glands. In support of this possibility, 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing has detected very similar communities of organisms in meconium and in colostrum [41], [50]. The taxonomic composition of these communities, which are most often dominated by Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), does not correspond to the bacterial abundances in maternal perinatal fecal samples [41], suggesting that the mother is able to regulate which bacteria reach the fetus, and/or that a restricted set of bacteria can survive in the fetal GIT to serve as a first inoculum and initiate the GIT colonization process.Early colonizers and role of maternal transmission in the initial development of the GIT microbiota The taxonomic composition detected in infants at the first timepoint analyzed, I1, is shown in Figure S2A. At this timepoint, the GIT microbiota of different infants is quite divergent, since in each one of them a single genus dominates extensively. Bacteroides dominance is the most prevalent, being detected in 5 of the neonates, followed by Clostridium (3 neonates), Veillonella (2 neonates), Bifidobacterium (2 neonates), and Escherichia (1 neonate). Among the 9 infants who were born vaginally and were breastfed exclusively (MIPs —Mother-Infant Pairs— 1, 3, 8, 16, 17, 19 and 21) or received a little amount of formula early on (MIPs 2 and 13), all five dominance patterns can be found, although Bacteroides is the most common. Bifidobacterium dominates in one exclusively breastfed infant (MIP17) and in the infant who was only partially breastfed (MIP9), both of whom were vaginally born. On the other hand, the three infants born by C-section had I1 microbiotas dominated by a Firmicutes genus, i. e., Clostridium (MIPs 6 and 12) or Veillonella (MIP7). This is in agreement with previous studies indicating that C-section delays the establishment of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and E. coli [31], [51]. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) in Figure S3 shows that C-section does influence the taxonomic composition of the infant microbiota at I1, although it only explains 16% of the total variability. Antibiotic use during delivery and supplementation of the infant's diet with formula (Table 1) play a more limited role, as they explain 11% and 7% of the total variability at this timepoint, respectively (Table S5). The five genera that dominate the I1 microbiota in different neonates may have had an important head start for GIT colonization, as all of them have been identified in meconium, although they were not the most common taxa revealed by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing in term infants [41]. Moreover, we have previously shown that the meconia passed by two of the infants in this cohort (MIPs 2 and 21) contain 16S rRNA gene sequences, including sequences from Bacteroides and Clostridium, that are also recovered at 100% identity from the corresponding maternal samples and infant samples from different timepoints [41]. This suggests that these bacteria can be acquired in utero and then maintained in the infant for long periods of time. In addition, here we detect that one-week-old infants share a substantial, but highly variable among individuals, percentage of GIT microbiota genera with their respective mothers prior to giving birth (between 26% and 88%, average 71%). These taxa could have been acquired in utero, during delivery or through breast milk. The early colonizers of a given environment can have crucial consequences for the further development of the community. Theoretical models of succession differ on whether they consider that those organisms able to establish themselves in a long-term manner in a given environment will be able to colonize it from the start, or, rather, that early succession will be dominated exclusively by “opportunists” or “pioneers” adapted to the transient conditions common to all recently opened spaces. Pioneers are expected to have cosmopolitan distributions, broad dispersal and rapid growth capabilities in order to arrive first and quickly occupy an empty space [52], [53]. Most of the genera that we find dominating at I1 hardly correspond to this definition. Except for Clostridium and Escherichia, the remaining genera (Bacteroides, Veillonella and Bifidobacterium) are intermediate or slowly growing species with known optimal generation times ranging from one to three hours [54], [55]. Moreover, their metabolism is strictly anaerobic, their environmental distribution is not cosmopolitan but host-associated [56], and they can be found at high abundances in later stages of succession. These observations suggest that these organisms are not opportunists taking advantage of a newly available habitat, but rather GIT-specialists, highly competitive in this particular environment. Therefore, the GIT microbial succession does not seem to follow a “facilitation” model, in which pioneers colonize an open space and create the necessary conditions for more specialized late-coming organisms [52]. Although it is possible that a facilitation phase may have taken place at a very rapid pace during the first days after birth, it is still noteworthy that, with the exception of one infant whose microbiota consisted almost exclusively of Escherichia and other enterobacteria, all infants at I1 had a microbiota that was already dominated by a strict anaerobe, contrary to the common assumption that early colonizers must be facultative anaerobes [57]. Rather, it suggests that anaerobic conditions are quickly established, and that the strict anaerobes have strong competitive advantages that allow them to rapidly dominate over any facultative anaerobes that could have been present during the very first days after birth, such as the vaginal Lactobacillus acquired through the birth canal [29]. If the I1-dominating genera were present in the GIT before the moment of birth, even if at very low abundances, a rapid expansion may have occurred as soon as conditions became favorable. The start of breastfeeding should select for organisms able to grow in its main constituents, such as lactose and Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs). These oligosaccharides are the main growth factors for Bifidobacterium [58], but recent work has shown that they can also sustain the efficient growth of Bacteroides [59]. Remarkably, although Bacteroides has often been reported to be uncommon during the neonatal period, we detected a microbiota dominated by this genus in five of the 13 one-week-old infants. In fact, it should not be surprising that Bacteroides might quickly establish, given that it is the only genus besides Bifidobacterium known to efficiently grow on HMOs and that it is also one of the most efficient utilizers of the mucin molecules that line the intestinal epithelium [60]. Many species of Bifidobacterium, Escherichia and Clostridium can also utilize mucin, in addition to lactose [61]. Veillonella, on the other hand, can't metabolize carbohydrates and requires short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as lactate or pyruvate, for growth [62]. Its dominance in two of the one-week-old infants suggests that a short food chain had already been established whereby Veillonella could have access to SCFA produced by other GIT genera, for instance by lactose fermentation. In this regard, it can be noted that, in the infants having a high abundance of Veillonella, genera that can ferment lactose to SCFA, such as Clostridium or Streptococcus, were indeed also abundant.Dynamics of taxonomic and functional richness and diversity during the first year of life In order to characterize the dynamics of richness and diversity in the infant microbiota from the first week to the one-year mark, we computed the Chao1 estimator [63] and the Shannon index [64], for both taxa and functions (Table S6). Chao1 estimates richness, i. e., the number of taxa or functions present in a community, whereas the Shannon index of diversity takes into account both richness and evenness, i. e., how similar the abundances of the different taxa or functions are. The dynamics of taxon richness along time are presented in Figure 1 for individual infants (A) and across all individuals (C). Chao1 values increase overall between I1 and I5 (p = 6.18e-18), an increase that is present in most of the infants. However, the increase is not linear (linear regression p = 0.205, Figure S4A), nor continuous. In most infants, richness is under two thirds of the maternal value (MB) at I1, and then increases from I1 to I2. Although change across all infants is not significant for this first interval (p = 0.139), the tendency to increase is reflected in median values (Figure 1C). In the I2–I3 interval, even though richness increases or decreases in similar numbers of infants, overall it is higher at I3 than at I1 (p = 2.33e-38) and I2 (p = 3.70e-24), partly due to the presence of three outliers having very high I3 values (MIPs 7, 13 and 17). Then, from I3 to I4, the interval in which solid foods were introduced, most infants present a decrease in richness, which is significant across individuals (p = 2.06e-09). This decreasing trend may or may not reverse from I4 to I5, so that the change in this interval does not reach significance (p = 0.107) and richness values at I5 remain significantly lower than those that had been attained by I3 (p = 1.13e-05), before the introduction of solid foods. Richness at I5 is also significantly lower than that of the mothers (p = 2.76e-37 vs. MB), although by this final timepoint most infants have already surpassed two thirds of the MB richness value. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the temporal profiles of richness change for individual infants retrieves three significant clusters, one including infants 6, 8 and 9, another including infants 13 and 17, and a last cluster including infants 19 and 21 (Figure 1A). These clusters do not associate with delivery type, antibiotic use or formula supplementation. The taxon diversity changes undergone by the different infants during the year are as variable as those seen for taxon richness, but some trends can also be discerned (Figure 1B, 1D). These trends mirror the behavior of richness in some time intervals, but not in others. As seen for richness, taxon diversity increases significantly between I1 and I5, and, in this case, regression analysis indicates that the increase can be considered linear when this entire period is considered (p-value = 0.024; Figure S4B). The pattern of change is similar to that of richness throughout the first three months; however, trends that are opposite to those observed for richness are present after the three months mark, as, in most cases, the Shannon index increases in I3–I4 and decreases in I4–I5. In terms of median values, there are increases between all consecutive timepoints except I4–I5, when the median diversity decreases to a value similar to that attained by I3 (p = 0.053; Figure 1D). By I5, taxon diversity is still significantly lower than that of MB (p = 0.016) but most infants have reached a Shannon index value that surpasses two thirds of that of their mother, a situation that is again comparable to that of taxon richness. Hierarchical clustering groups the diversity temporal profiles of the infants into two significant clusters, one including infants 2, 12, 17, 19 and 21, and the other, in which the trend towards a linear increase in diversity with time is more pronounced, including infants 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9,13 and 16 (Figure 1B). Clustering patterns differ then for taxonomic richness and diversity, with only infants 6, 8 and 9, on one hand, and infants 19 and 21, on the other, clustering together for both parameters. The opposite trends in taxon richness and diversity from I3 to I5 suggest that changes in richness correspond to the appearance and disappearance of rare taxa, which, if substantial, would respectively result in lower and higher degrees of evenness in the distribution of taxa abundances in the community, captured in the Shannon diversity index. Indeed, rank abundance curves confirm that richness changes are driven mainly by the removal of rare genera in I3–I4, followed by the addition of different rare genera in I4–I5 (data not shown). Regarding functional richness and diversity in the infant samples (Figure 1E, 1F), their behavior is in sharp contrast to that observed at the taxonomic level, as these functional parameters fluctuate through time across a relatively narrow range of values, with no clear trends to increase or decrease along development (Table S6, Figure S4C, S4D). In fact, even at the earliest sample collection times, the median values of functional richness and diversity in infants are already similar or higher than those obtained for the mothers, particularly in the perinatal samples (MA), which present the lowest values. This indicates that the infant microbiota attains a level of functional complexity similar to that of the mothers from very early on, possibly due in part to the general presence of essential bacterial functions and of those specifically needed for survival in the gut environment.Succession in infants does not follow a strictly deterministic course Whether ecological successions are deterministic processes is still a matter of contention. In microbial communities, this question has rarely been explored. Our prospective cohort analysis enables us to address this issue in several complementary ways. We have already described the lack of a common successional pattern across individuals in terms of the magnitude and direction of taxon richness and diversity changes between timepoints. Clustering analysis of individual samples using the Bray-Curtis distance [65] provides other means of assessing the degree of determinism in the infants' successional paths. Firstly, we analyzed the clustering patterns within each MIP to determine whether they all share the same topology. For both taxonomic and functional composition, MIPs have seemingly idiosyncratic clustering patterns (Figure S5). The most marked tendency is the grouping of I5 with maternal samples, observed in 31% and 62% of the MIPs at the taxonomic and functional levels, respectively, independently of the mode of birth. The lack of a common clustering pattern across the different MIPs reinforces the notion that the infants' successional paths follow non-deterministic dynamics, although a trend of convergence towards the maternal functional composition by the end of the year is suggested. Global comparisons of all infant and maternal samples at the taxonomic and functional levels also point in this direction. Such comparisons reveal no clear pattern of sample clustering, neither by individual nor by timepoint (Figure 3A–B). The fact that samples from the same timepoint do not cluster together indicates that the microbiota present at each timepoint can not be defined as a well-differentiated, discrete and predictable community, such as the seral communities postulated in some models of vegetational succession [66]. Nevertheless, some degree of unevenness can be observed in the distribution of samples across clusters, pointing towards an effect of age on microbiota composition. The taxonomic heatmap in Figure 3A shows a large cluster (a) that contains 30 infant samples but only one maternal sample, as well as two clusters (b and c) that contain nearly all of the maternal samples and some I4–I5 infant samples. A similar effect can be seen in the functional heatmap (Figure 3B), where a single cluster contains the 26 maternal samples, most of the I5 samples and only a few of the samples from other infant timepoints. In other words, as in the MIP-based analyses, I5 shows here a clear tendency to cluster with the maternal samples, for both taxonomy and function.10.1371/journal.pgen.1004406.g003Figure 3Heatmaps and clustering of individual gut microbiota samples for taxonomic (A) and functional composition (B). Clustering was based on Bray-Curtis distances. (A) Only the genera above 1% abundance in at least one sample are depicted. (B) Functional composition was established based on TIGRFAM main functional roles. Each sample is identified at the bottom of the heatmaps by a code that specifies the MIP to which it belongs and the corresponding timepoint. Maternal samples are additionally highlighted by means of black bars. Colors on top of each heatmap represent the timepoints to which samples belong. Pink circles identify specific clusters referred to in the text. Finally, comparison of the heatmaps corresponding to each timepoint in the series (Figure S2) enables us to evaluate whether early microbial assemblages determine the nature of the next ones to come. Rather, it can be seen that the patterns of association among samples from different individuals change through time. For instance, infants 2 and 16 have very similar taxa composition profiles at I1, while they differ widely at all subsequent timepoints. Conversely, infants 17 and 19 are the most similar one-year-olds, whereas at earlier timepoints they had microbiotas dominated by Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides, respectively. The varying patterns of association among samples through time indicate that early similarity among infants does not predict similar developmental paths or one-year mark outcomes.Is there directionality in taxonomic and functional change along development? We next set out to investigate whether, in spite of the lack of determinism in successional paths, an overall pattern of directional change through time towards an adult-like microbiota can be discerned, as suggested by global and MIP-based clustering analyses. To this aim, we employed several multivariate analyses based on the Bray-Curtis distances among samples. We first examined whether there are significant overall differences among the entire set of analyzed timepoints. Comparison of distances between and within timepoints revealed that significant differences exist at both the taxonomic and functional levels (ANOSIM: taxonomic R = 0.30, p = 0.001 & functional R = 0.27, p = 0.001). The plots in Figure 2A–B display the amount of variation among samples within and between timepoints and allow us to appreciate the wider divergence between samples in earlier timepoints and the progressive increase in homogeneity as the gut microbiota develops, as previously noted [6]. This can be considered a first clearly directional trend in the data, observable at both the taxonomic and functional levels. We then performed a series of pairwise ANOSIM analyses in order to detect where the main differences among timepoints lie. All infant samples, including those from the one-year timepoint, are distinguishable from maternal samples both by taxonomy and by function (Table S7). The results obtained for comparisons between infant samples are illustrated in Figure 2C, where each timepoint is represented by a color and is linked by lines of this color to all timepoints from which it does not differ significantly. At the taxonomic level, no pairwise comparison for timepoints I1 to I4 identifies significant differences, whereas each of these timepoints is distinguishable from the I5 timepoint. In other words, this analysis reveals no progressive increase in taxonomic composition distance along time. In contrast, at the functional level, although none of the infant timepoints is significantly different from its immediate neighbor, differences become significative for timepoints that are separated by one or two intermediate timepoints. That is, in this case, larger functional differences appear between timepoints that are more separated in time, indicating a clear directionality along infant development. Nevertheless, this type of analysis does not show a progression in microbiota composition towards the adult state, as all infant timepoints remain distinguishable from those of the mothers, for both taxonomy and function. In order to further visualize how the compositional variation among samples is distributed, we performed multivariate statistical techniques that provide the coordinates of the samples in a reduced space representing the main variation components. In contrast to the ANOSIM analyses, Canonical Correspondence Analyses (CCA; Figure 4A, 4B) identify a progressive change from timepoint to timepoint with clear directionality towards the adult state for both taxonomy and function. The taxonomic and functional CCAs recover the same pattern, with a slight difference in terms of the proximity between timepoints I2 and I3, which are closer for the functional data set. Although discrete clusters of samples by timepoint are not present, the CCA plots show an orderly displacement from I1 to I5, clearly observed in the changing direction of the timepoint arrows, which indicates the main axis of deviation from the reference maternal timepoint (MA). Moreover, in both cases the first axis of the CCA graph separates the majority of infant samples (I1, I2, I3 and I4) from the one-year-old and maternal samples (I5, MB and MA), indicating that progressive change throughout the first year has resulted in a microbiota that is more similar to that of the mothers. We also analyzed the taxonomic and functional datasets with Principal Coordinates Analyses (PCoA) performed on matrices of Gower distances [67], followed by the drawing of convex hulls enclosing all samples pertaining to a particular timepoint [68]. It can be seen in Figure 4C and 4D that, for both taxonomy and function, there is a general decrease of the area of the convex hulls with age, indicating again a decrease in heterogeneity among coetaneous samples, as well as a time-ordered displacement of the infants' convex hulls towards those of the mothers. We calculated the taxonomic and functional dissimilarities between two timepoints by estimating the non-overlapping areas of their convex hulls (Table S8). As expected, in both cases dissimilarity is lowest between maternal samples and between infant timepoints that are close in time, and is at its peak when I1 convex hulls are compared to the maternal ones. So, both CCA and PCoA coincide in showing a clear time-ordered displacement of taxonomic and functional composition whereby each successive infant timepoint becomes more similar to the mothers.10.1371/journal.pgen.1004406.g004Figure 4Directionality in taxonomic and functional change through time. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) of taxonomic (A) and functional (B) data, showing that the main axis (CCA1) separates infant timepoints I1, I2, I3 and I4 from I5, MA and MB. The percent variation explained by the main axis is 60.22% in A and 81.57% in B, while CCA2 explains 14.20% variation in A and 6.99% in B. The direction of the timepoint arrows indicates the main axis of deviation from the reference maternal timepoint (MA). Taxonomic (C) and functional (D) Principal Coordinates Analyses (PCoA) depicting convex hulls enclosing all samples pertaining to a determined timepoint. The percent variation explained by the main axis is 46.60% in C and 30.28% in D, while PCoA2 explains 23.00% variation in C and 16.04% in D. Heterogeneity within timepoints is represented by arrow length (CCA) or convex hull area (PCoA). All analyses identify a progressive change from timepoint to timepoint with clear directionality towards the composition of the mothers. However, the convex hulls in Figure 4C and 4D point out an interesting difference between taxonomic and functional compositional change. In the case of taxonomic composition, the maternal convex hulls are enclosed within the space occupied by the infant timepoints, which seem to close in around the maternal hulls as time progresses. In contrast, in the case of function, the maternal hulls occupy the rightmost part of the graph and the infant samples progressively shift in that direction, so that some degree of overlap with the maternal hulls is only observed from the I3 timepoint onwards. This suggests that the GIT microbiota undergoes a more pronounced directional shift during succession at the functional than at the taxonomic level.Parallelisms between taxonomy and function counter the functional equivalence hypothesis In spite of some differences, we have just shown that the changes in taxonomic and functional microbiota composition with time are similar both in terms of the directionality of change toward the maternal profile and of the progressive reduction of heterogeneity among individual samples. This argues for an effect of the taxonomic composition of the microbiota on its functional gene repertoire. In order to further investigate the relationship between taxonomy and function, we analyzed the functional similarities among GIT microbiota genera. For this, we determined and compared the functional profiles of all genera that reached 1% abundance in at least one sample. Because not enough information was available in a sample per sample basis for each genus, functional profiles were established after pooling all samples for a given timepoint. Functional profiles were defined as vectors containing the relative abundances of each TIGRFAM subrole within a particular genus and timepoint. We then constructed a dendrogram clustering genera by functional profile similarity as measured by the Bray-Curtis distance (Figure 5). The resulting dendrogram mainly follows phylogenetic relationships, suggesting that each phylogenetic group has a characteristic set of functional profiles. At the genus level, the functional profiles computed for the different timepoints generally form an exclusive group, suggesting that either the same species of the genus are present along development or that all members of the genus share similar sets of genes. Moreover, clustering by phylogenetic affiliation also occurs at higher taxonomic ranks, as functional groups comprising only members of specific families and orders are recovered. Six major functional groups are obtained: Group 1, enclosing all Enterobacteriales; Group 2, enclosing all Bacteroidales and Verrucomicrobiales; Group 3, comprising all Selenomonadales, plus the Clostridiales genera Pseudoflavonifractor and Subdoligranulum and the δ-proteobacteria Desulfovibrio; Group 4, enclosing all Pasteurellales; Group 5, comprising most of the Clostridiales, and Group 6, enclosing the Clostridiales genera Anaerostipes and Faecalibacterium, the Lactobacillales and all Actinobacteria. Interestingly, only members of the phyla Firmicutes (Clostridiales, Lactobacillales and Selenomonadales) and Proteobacteria (Enterobacteriales, Pasteurellales and the genus Desulfovibrio) are present in multiple major functional groups. In particular, the order Clostridiales is the most functionally diverse, as it is the only order split into several of the major groups, even though a large majority of genera are found in functional group 5.10.1371/journal.pgen.1004406.g005Figure 5Dendrogram showing six main groups of gut microbiota genera based on functional profile clustering. Functional profiles were defined as the relative abundances of TIGRFAM subroles in a given genus. Only genera present in any sample at >1% abundance and having genes representing at least 50% of the 108 subroles detected in our complete data set were included. Clustering was based on the complete linkage method applied to a matrix of pairwise Bray-Curtis distances between the functional profiles of genera. Branches in the resulting dendrogram were collapsed when genera on the tips pertained to the same order. Orders of the same phylum have different shades of the same color. Although the general topology of the dendrogram in Figure 5 implies that the functional profile of taxa is strongly related to phylogenetic affiliation, some particular groupings indicate that functional convergence may occur among distantly related taxa. Most remarkable is the clustering in functional group 6 of the Bifidobacteriales and other less abundant Actinobacteria with the Firmicutes order Lactobacillales, which comprises the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). Bifidobacteria are known to share many metabolic properties with the LAB, notably the production of lactic acid as a main endpoint of carbohydrate fermentation. In addition, group 6 also contains two Clostridiales genera, the acetate-requiring butyrate-producers Faecalibacterium and Anaerostipes. Faecalibacterium can also produce lactate, whereas Anaerostipes rather consumes it to produce butyrate. Another interesting grouping is that of the Verrucomicrobiales and the Bacteroidales, mainly represented by Akkermansia and Bacteroides, two genera that share important metabolic functions in the gut, as both are acetate and propionate producers and highly adept at mucin degradation [60]. Nevertheless, the observed groupings among phylogenetically distant taxa do not indicate functional equivalences that could account for the inter-individual variation in patterns of taxon dominance. This is most evident for timepoint I1, in which the taxonomic discrepancy among samples is maximal and the microbiotas of each individual are mostly dominated by a single genus (Figure S2A). Under the functional equivalence hypothesis, we would expect that the most abundant taxa present in the different samples would have similar functional profiles, independently of their phylogenetic lineage affiliation, and would cluster together into specific functional groups. Rather, the five genera that dominate the microbiota in different I1 infants (Bacteroides, Clostridium, Veillonella, Bifidobacterium or Escherichia) are found in deeply separated groups of the functional profile tree. This suggests that their functional capabilities are vastly different, and therefore that functional similarity and the functional equivalence hypothesis can't explain their presence as dominating taxa in the microbiotas of different infants.Dynamics of specific taxa and functions along development Figures 3A and S2A show that, overall, the infants' samples can have high abundances of bacteria such as Escherichia, Citrobacter, Bifidobacterium, Veillonella and Streptococcus, in addition to Clostridium and Bacteroides, which are also common in adults. Venn diagrams allowed us to visualize details of the dynamics of taxa acquired or lost at each particular timepoint and of those that were maintained throughout the whole process of development. We identified a small core of ten genera that are present at all timepoints, in all infants and adults, although at very different abundances, comprised of Bacillus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Streptococcus and Vibrio. Of note, this global core of 10 genera includes members of four of the functional groups defined above (Group 1: Escherichia; Group 2: Bacteroides and Prevotella; Group 5: Clostridium and Eubacterium; and Group 6: Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus). Bacillus (order Bacillales) and Vibrio (Vibrionales) are not represented in the functional profiles dendrogram because their low abundances precluded the computation of reliable functional profiles. We also identified separately the core genera of every timepoint (Table S9), and the Venn diagram in Figure 6A shows the intersections of the different infant “timecores”. New genera appear at every timecore, some of which remain in all subsequent timecores and are also present in those of the mothers. This is the case of Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus, which join the core at timepoint I2, and of Pseudoflavonifractor, which joins at I3. At I4 there is an input of 12 new core taxa that will remain in the I5 timecore, including Anaerostipes, Blautia, Coprococcus, Dorea, Fusobacterium and Roseburia, and 16 new core genera make their appearance at I5, including Acidaminococcus, Alistipes, Butyrivibrio, Parabacteroides and Subdoligranulum. All of the core genera that are introduced in I4 and I5 are also present in the MB, and, with few exceptions, in the MA maternal timecores. In contrast, several genera of enteric bacteria appearing in the I2 timecore only remain through I3, or are maintained until I5 but are not present in the maternal timecores. Furthermore, all infant timecores except I1 include genera not present in any other infant timecore (in pale yellow in Figure 6A), pointing towards a continuous acquisition and loss of taxa throughout succession. Finally, Desulfovibrio and Dialister, as well as 17 rare genera, are present in both the MA and MB cores but not in those of any of the infant timepoints.10.1371/journal.pgen.1004406.g006Figure 6Timecore Venn diagrams. Changes in the core sets of genera (A) or functions (B) present at each infant timepoint. In both cases, areas representing the different timecores are enclosed by lines of the corresponding colors. The red central circles represent the genera or functions present in all five infant timecores; areas filled in dark orange, medium orange, light orange and yellow represent features present in four, three, two or one infant timecores. The number of features included in each section of the diagram is shown and areas are approximately proportional to these numbers. We also analyzed taxon dynamics by means of abundance plots of specific genera through time (data not shown) and with a Self-Organizing Map approach (SOM) that classified genera into groups with distinct abundance profiles along development. Figure S6A shows the three clusters of distinct temporal profiles (decreasing, increasing or peaking at I3) with >80% support in a bootstrapped SOM procedure. Only 18 genera, including Klebsiella and 10 other Proteobacteria, significantly grouped in the decreasing profile cluster, although the individual profiles of numerous other genera, such as Bifidobacterium, Citrobacter, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Escherichia and Streptococcus, also followed decreasing trendlines. A cluster including 11 genera whose abundances significantly peaked at I3 was also recovered. These genera were all rare, even at I3. Finally, the largest cluster grouped 31 genera that significantly increased after the I3 timepoint, mainly belonging to the Firmicutes. At the functional level, Figure 3B shows that, for the TIGRFAM main functional roles, all samples have rather similar profiles, reflecting the fact that substantial functional requirements are likely shared among the different bacterial communities. Nevertheless, chi-square tests identify highly significant differences in the distribution of all main functional roles across timepoints (p≤0.001), except for “central intermediary metabolism” (p = 0.02) and “unclassified proteins” (p = 0.4). “Protein synthesis”, “transport and binding proteins” and “energy metabolism” predominate across all samples, with “protein synthesis” being the most abundant role in most cases and one or the other of the latter two roles being the most abundant in a small fraction of the infants' samples. Analyses at the TIGRFAM subrole level enable a better differentiation of the functional capacities present in the microbiota at different timepoints. Of the 116 subroles established in the TIGRFAMs database, 108 are detected in at least one of the samples, and 69 represent core functions detected in all. Two additional functions, “nitrogen metabolism” and “one-carbon metabolism”, are only absent in some maternal samples, elevating the number of core functions present in all infants to 71. In contrast, there are no functions that are absent from all infant timecores but present in all MA or MB samples. The Venn diagram in Figure 6B displays the intersections of the different infant timecores (Table S10), showing that very few functions beyond those of the common core are present in individual infant timecores or combinations thereof. The timecore of I1 is the most reduced, but is lacking only seven functional subroles that appear in the I2 timecore and remain thereafter. These subroles are those involved in the biosynthesis of polyamines, biotin and pyridoxine, in the transport and binding of nucleosides, purines and pyrimidines, in the tricarboxylic acid cycle of aerobic metabolism, and in cellular chemotaxis and motility, as well as one of the subroles related to mobile and extrachromosomal element functions. In addition, only 12 more functional subroles are present in one or a few of the infant timecores, including “cell envelope surface structures”, which is present in timecores I1 to I3, and “nitrogen fixation” and “DNA restriction/modification”, which only appear in the I5 and maternal timecores. The SOM approach also identifies a few temporal trends in the abundance dynamics of TIGRFAM subroles, although with a bootstrap support lower than that obtained for the clustering of taxonomic profiles (Figure S6B). In particular, several subroles follow a sustained decrease from I1 to I5. These include several aerobiosis-related functions, such as the biosynthesis of lipoate and heme, essential cofactors of aerobic metabolism, and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, an alternative to glycolysis used mostly by Enterococcus, Escherichia and other Proteobacteria during aerobic conditions. The decrease in this pathway is then concordant with the taxonomic trends described above. Other decreasing subroles are related to cell envelope surface structures and to pathogenesis, although toxin production and resistance functions fluctuate throughout the year without an increasing or decreasing trend.Potential patterns of association during community assembly based on presence/absence of taxa in diverse environments To explore how positive and negative associations among taxa may have contributed to shape the gut's ecological succession, we investigated how the main genera detected in the infant and maternal gut microbiota relate within a network based on a wider environmental framework. We employed a previously constructed network based on presence/absence of taxa across a large variety of environments [56], the significance of which has been assessed by means of an appropriate null model (see Materials and Methods; Pascual-García A, Tamames J, Bastolla U, personal communication). For each infant and maternal timepoint, we extracted from this parent network the relationships of the timecore taxa. The subnetwork in Figure 7 represents the ensemble of these relationships for MB and all of the infant timepoints, color-coded according to whether or not they are present at MB and, for those that are, according to the first timepoint in which they appeared (see Figure Legend).10.1371/journal.pgen.1004406.g007Figure 7Potential taxon interactions during assembly of the gut microbiota. The represented subnetwork links all genera present in the different infant timecores and in the MB timecore, showing relationships inferred in a parent network based on presence/absence of taxa in multiple environments. We show with continuous lines those relations that have been identified as significant aggregations in the parent network, and with dotted lines the significant segregations. Relations are color-coded according to whether or not they are present in the maternal MB timecore and, for the relationships that are present at MB, according to the first timepoint in which they appeared. Relations that are not observed in the MB timecore are shown in grey; relations present only in MB are colored brown; relations appearing at I5 are colored orange; relations appearing at I4 are purple; relations appearing at I3 are green; relations appearing at I2 are blue; and relations appearing at I1 are red. Nodes are additionally colored according to their dominant environment in the original classification of Tamames et al. [56]. A dominant environment was assigned for a given genus when more than half of the samples where it was detected belonged to that environment. Red: host environments; Green: terrestrial environments; White: no particular preference for any environment (i.e., cosmopolitan taxa). The thickness of the network edges represents the significance of the association (z-score). The overall topology of the subnetwork clearly delineates a central cluster populated by numerous links representing significant aggregations, surrounded by a much sparser peripheral “shell”. Remarkably, the central cluster exclusively contains taxa and relations that appeared from I1 to I5 and that are also present in the MB timecore (links colored in red, blue, purple or orange), while the outer shell is mainly formed by taxa and relations restricted to the MB timecore (links colored in brown). Network theory indicates that the existence of a central and densely connected set of nodes in a network facilitates system robustness and evolvability, helping adaptation to large fluctuations of the environment and to noise of intrinsic processes [69]. Regarding the temporal assembly of this central cluster, examination of the time of appearance of the different aggregations reveals that few of them existed at I1 (in red), although Bacteroides, Clostridium and Enterococcus formed a transitive aggregation already at this point. Transitive aggregations, where three or more taxa are linked to one another, are highly unlikely to occur by chance and their existence suggests that the involved taxa may sustain mutualistic relationships. In addition to this main triangle, a single other aggregation appears within the central cluster at I1, linking Prevotella to Bacteroides. Following with the assembly of the central cluster, several new aggregations are formed at I2 (in blue) enabled by the appearance of Ruminococcus, Faecalibacterium and Collinsella, which are linked into a triangle. In addition, Ruminococcus and Faecalibacterium form another triangle with Eubacterium – which was already present at the I1 timecore without being linked to other genera. These two new triangles are linked to the Bacteroides-Clostridium-Enterococcus triangle through a single aggregation between Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides. Remarkably, in contrast to I2, no new aggregation is formed within the central cluster, or in the surrounding shell, at the I3 timepoint. Although this difference could be influenced by the fact that only 9 samples were available for the I2 timepoint, which could artefactually inflate the I2 timecore, the same result is obtained in a subnetwork based on timecores for the 9 infants who were sampled at all timepoints. This suggests that a stable stage of community assembly had been reached in the infants' gut by one month of age, at least with respect to the core taxa of the microbiota, which was not altered during the remaining months of exclusive milk feeding. At I4, after the introduction of solid foods, a large number of novel aggregations (in purple) are again enabled by the appearance in the timecore of several Firmicutes genera. In particular, Dorea establishes a large number of links at this point, including numerous triangles and several larger cliques (subgraphs in which all nodes are connected to each other) that link different Firmicutes genera, as well as a triangle formed by Dorea, Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides. At I5, another Clostridiales genus, Anaerotruncus, and two Bacteroidales, Parabacteroides and Alistipes, join the central cluster forming numerous aggregations. Anaerotruncus links with the Bacteroidales genera Alistipes and Prevotella, and with nearly all of the Firmicutes genera that appeared at I4, forming numerous triangles and one clique. On their part, Parabacteroides and Alistipes are also involved in several links and transitive aggregations, including a clique with Acetivibrio and Bacteroides. It is worth noting the abundance of transitive relations that are enabled in the central cluster at I4 and I5, consolidating its structure and indicating that the introduction of solid foods to the infants' diet likely promoted an increase in the complexity of community assembly. Moreover, as already mentioned, the genera restricted to the MB timecore do not join the central cluster of the subnetwork, and rather form a surrounding “shell” that is connected with this cluster through a moderate number of aggregations. This suggests that, although community assembly was still not complete by the one-year mark, the main nucleus of the gut community was already established at this point. Interestingly, network theory indicates that core/periphery structures may form at times of environmental stress, leading to the development of more condensed network structures and the segregation of a network core [69]. In the infant gut, the introduction of solid foods between I3 and I4 represented a major disturbance that must have permanently altered the conditions of the gut environment, and the resulting stress in the subsequent months may have promoted the consolidation of the central cluster. Besides those that form the central cluster of the subnetwork, several genera appear during infant development that only connect to this cluster through a limited number of direct links or longer paths. In fact, most of the genera present at the I1 timecore are located outside of the central cluster. Remarkably, these include a small (red) star-shaped subgraph with the global-core genus Streptococcus at its center, which aggregates Escherichia and Lactobacillus, also members of the global core, and Staphylococcus and Veillonella, which appear at I1 but are not maintained in all infant timecores. This subgraph is only connected to the central cluster through a (red) link between Escherichia and Enterococcus. Several other peripheral genera directly join this subgraph at other timepoints. These additional genera enable a few more aggregative links with the central cluster, as well as several paths linking the subgraph to other peripheral genera, mostly appearing at I5 or MB. On the other hand, the subgraph genera are also involved in several segregative relations appearing at different timepoints, with Streptomyces, Desulfovibrio, Fibrobacter and the central cluster genus Alistipes. Other peripheral genera appearing early on during infant development include Bifidobacterium, which is only connected to the central cluster through links to Collinsella and Enterococcus (in blue), and a series of Proteobacteria. Among these, we find the global core genus Vibrio, which never connects to the central cluster, and directly segregates from it through the genus Dorea. Several other peripheral genera appear at the I4 and I5 timecores, connecting to the central cluster through direct links (in purple or orange) or aggregative paths. Interestingly, these include the spirochaete Treponema, which is considered atypical in urban populations and had until now mostly been detected in rural populations of Africa and South America and in ancient mesoamerican remains [25], [70]. In addition, two enteric Proteobacteria, Citrobacter and Klebsiella, are present as a separate component of the subnetwork, linked to each other but involved in no other relationship. Citrobacter and Klebsiella are restricted to the I2–I5 and I2–I3 timecores (Table S9), respectively, although they can also reach high abundances in individual infants at other timepoints (Figure S2). This scenario suggests that these taxa, along with Shigella and Shewanella that only momentarily join the subnetwork, are not permanent residents of the microbiota, but perhaps opportunists that take advantage of transient conditions in the infant gut. Regarding the genera that join the periphery of the subnetwork as part of the MB timecore, Desulfovibrio and Oxalobacter are the ones showing the larger number of aggregations to the central cluster. The aggregations detected for Desulfovibrio are of note, since they reflect experimentally established cross-feeding relationships of this H2-consuming, sulfate-reducing bacterium with the H2-producer Collinsella and the sulfatase-encoding Bacteroidales genera [71]. On the other hand, there is on the right side of the subnetwork a series of MB genera that clearly segregate from the central cluster, mainly through direct segregative links sustained by Pseudomonas and Pedobacter. Interestingly, most of these genera have been classified as cosmopolitan rather than mainly host-associated [56], and none of them ever reaches abundances of 1% in any sample. In addition, approximately half of these genera are absent from the MA timecore (Table S9), suggesting that they can be easily displaced when there are alterations of the gut environment. This scenario suggests that these late-appearing taxa might be facultative members of the gut microbiota or allochthonous species that frequently make their way to the gut without establishing as main components of the community.Putting it together: Overall patterns of microbiota development delineate a successional process redirected by the introduction of solid foods The various patterns of microbiota development described in the preceding sections suggest that during the time-course analyzed we are likely observing two major, distinct colonization phases, separated by the introduction of solid foods to the infants' diets. The first colonization phase would encompass the period during which infants were fed only milk, i. e., timepoints I1 to I3. During this period, the richness, diversity and complexity of interactions among taxa tend to increase in I1–I2, indicating that the relatively simple bacterial communities present by one week can tolerate the arrival and establishment of new species, to which the infants would undoubtedly be exposed during their first weeks of life. The variable behavior of taxon richness and diversity observed across infants during the I2–I3 period suggests that, by three months of age, different infants were at different stages of community development, with some still incorporating new species while others were starting to loose species, most likely due to interspecific competition. In the infants that underwent decreases in richness during this period, changes in Shannon values were not concomitant (Table S6), supporting the notion that interspecific competition purged the community of rare taxa, presumably not well adapted to thrive during this milk-feeding period. Accordingly, Bifidobacterium or Bacteroides, the only genera capable of thriving on both lactose and HMOs [59], dominated the I3 microbiota in nearly all infants, with the exception of those born by C-section (Figure S2), which supports the notion that C-section delays the establishment of these genera [51]. Moreover, among vaginally delivered infants, Bacteroides or Bifidobacterium dominated when mothers did or did not receive antibiotics during delivery, respectively. The I3 CCA (Figure S3) confirms that delivery type and use of peripartum antibiotics explain 22% and 12% of the taxonomic composition variation of the infant microbiota at this timepoint (Table S5). Classical models of succession posit that, after a period of competition leading to species loss, community stability will eventually increase in late successional stages, after which major community shifts will not occur unless a significant disturbance affects the ecosystem [52]. In our data, no such stabilization is observed, as the variable I2–I3 period is followed by a strong decrease in richness in I3–I4, followed by a trend towards richness recovery in I4–I5 (Table S6, Figure 1A, 1C). As stated earlier, these richness changes are mainly due to the loss and gain of rare genera, and are accompanied by opposite trends at the level of diversity (Table S6, Figure 1B, 1D). In addition, the number of core microbiota genera shared by all individuals increases importantly at I4 and I5 (Table S9, Figure 6A), with substantial repercussions on the configuration of relationships among taxa (Figure 7). Most likely, the introduction of solid foods between I3 and I4 contributed importantly to prevent the stabilization of the community, as this chronic disturbance altered the resources present in the gut environment. With solid foods, the variety of nutrients that become available to the infant gut microbiota clearly expands, potentially providing a larger number of niches for different organisms and contributing to the increase in diversity observed at I4. In particular, carbohydrates will now be available in a larger variety of forms, including numerous complex molecules found in cereals, fruits, vegetables and tubers (Table S1), providing a selective challenge for the milk adapted resident community. Our observation that solid food introduction is followed by a purge in rare taxa is consistent with the idea that fewer species will persist in the face of intense disturbances [72]. In the 7-months infant, the genera that thrived in the milk-adapted microbiota - i. e., Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides - continue to dominate, with the latter genus being now the most abundant in a majority of individuals. The rise of Bacteroides following the introduction of solid foods has been observed in previous studies [34] and is likely due to its large versatility for complex carbohydrate degradation. Nevertheless, some genera that had not been previously detected at high abundances (or only in very few individuals) expand now in the gut microbiota, in agreement with the notion that disturbance should facilitate invasion of the community by new species [73]. This is the case of Ruminococcus, which is now found among the most frequent genera in nearly all infants. Ruminococcus thrives on oligosaccharides such as raffinose and sucrose that constitute the most abundant soluble saccharides in plant tissues and is capable of partially degrading insoluble plant fibers such as lignin and cellulose [74], which likely explains its competitive advantage after the introduction of cereals, fruits and vegetables into the diet. Another genus that reaches high abundances for the first time in some 7-months-olds is Akkermansia, one of the main mucin-degraders in the gut microbiota [60], [75]. Mucin production is dependent on the availability of dietary amino acids and should increase with the higher protein content of solid foods, enabling the growth of mucin-specialized bacteria. On the other hand, the disturbance created by solid foods does not seem to enable invasion of the gut community by opportunistic species, as fast growers such as Escherichia rather decrease in abundance from I3 to I4. Moreover, the “pathogenesis” functional subrole also decreases markedly after the I3 timepoint, indicating that opportunistic pathogens are not taking advantage of the disturbance. In the last time interval analyzed, I4–I5, taxon richness tends to increase again mainly due to the acquisition of new rare taxa. This indicates that succession has now entered a second period of net species recruitment, although most incoming taxa have not been able to reach substantial frequencies, suggesting that the pre-established populations retain a competitive advantage. Nevertheless, substantial shifts occur during this period in relative taxon abundances. Several of the most abundant genera at I4 - i. e., Bifidobacterium, Veillonella, Escherichia - decrease substantially in I5. At the same time, the main butyrate producers of the gut microbiota, i. e., Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium and Roseburia, rise in abundance at this timepoint, with Faecalibacterium becoming the second most abundant genus overall (after Bacteroides). In addition, other SCFA producers, such as Blautia and Butyrivibrio, reach frequencies above 1% for the first time in I5. Between I4 and I5, the diet of Spanish Mediterranean infants changes substantially, as it becomes progressively similar to that of adults [36]. During this period the general consumption of animal protein increases importantly, as meats, fish, eggs and dairy products become more prevalent (Table S1). At the same time, the contribution of cereals continues to increase, probably enabling the rise of genera adept at fermenting starches and fiber, such as Bacteroides and the butyrate producers Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium and Roseburia. As a result of these changes, the ranking of taxon abundances observed in the one-year-old infants becomes remarkably similar to that of the mothers, with Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Clostridium and Ruminococcus present among the five top genera in I5, MA and MB (Figure S2). However, differences exist in the relative abundances of Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium between mothers and one-year-olds, with the first genus remaining more common in I5 while the latter has not yet reached the high levels at which it is found in MA and MB. Moreover, the richness (Figure 1C), diversity (Figure 1D) and complexity of interactions among taxa (Figure 7) at the one-year mark are still far from those observed in the maternal samples. Similarly, pairwise ANOSIM analyses (Table S7) and ordination techniques (Figure 4) detect differences in taxonomic and functional composition between I5 and the maternal samples, further corroborating that succession was incomplete at the one-year mark. In agreement, recent cross-sectional studies have suggested that an adult-like gut community may not be reached before three years of age [25]. In conclusion, our analyses of GIT microbiota development during the first year of life reveal an incomplete successional process, strongly marked by the introduction of solid foods to the infants' diets. Therefore, important questions regarding microbial succession in the infant GIT still remain for further analysis. A longer sampling period would be necessary to reveal the final progression of the gut microbiota towards an adult-like stage, and a tighter sampling around the time of introduction of solid foods would be required to clarify the transition that accompanies this event. On the other hand, in order to gain an in depth understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes at play in this environment, we will need to focus on the genetic structure and demographic dynamics of microbial populations as they settle within the gut.Materials and MethodsEthics statement This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Center for Public Health Research (CSISP), Valencia, Spain. All women participating in the study read and signed forms of informed consent specifically approved for this project by the Ethics Committee.Sample collection, pyrosequencing and initial processing of sequencing reads Fecal samples were collected by the mothers and stored in home freezers until brought to the laboratory, where they were stored at −80°C until processing. Samples were homogenized in a 50% RNA later/phosphate saline buffer solution and centrifuged for two minutes at 2000 rpm. Only the supernatant resulting from the latter spin was used for further processing. DNA was extracted using the Epicenter Master Pure Complete DNA & RNA Purification kit following manufacturer's specifications, except for an additional digestion step at the beginning of the extraction protocol with lysozyme for 30 minutes at 37°. Samples were then prepared for 454 pyrosequencing by adding a barcode and pooling them in groups of 20 samples per run, which provided between 35000 and 70000 reads per sample. Only reads that passed quality controls (average base score quality per read >20) were further analyzed after elimination of read replicates by means of CD-HIT-454 [76]. We addressed downstream analysis at read level rather than at contig level based on the prior assessing of the complexity of our communities, as simulation studies have determined that chimeras are particularly prevalent among contigs lower than 10 kbp in size [77], [78]. High-complexity microbial communities lacking dominant populations rarely produce contigs larger than 10 kbp, prompting the recommendation that such data sets should not be assembled at all.Gene calling, taxonomic assignment and functional annotation We used a combination of evidence-based and ab initio gene calling. In the first step, coding regions were identified based on homology searches at read level via BLASTX [79] against the NCBI-nr protein database considering an e-value cutoff of 0.001. Subsequently, we used GLIMMER3 [80] to identify any coding regions that were missed in the previous step by means of a fine-tuned IMM (Interpolated Markov Model). We used the ‘-X’ GLIMMER3 option, allowing fragmented ORF (Open Reading Frame) identification, and default settings for other options. In order to build the IMM we chose eight complete bacterial genomes from NCBI spanning the main gut microbiome phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria) and then extracted the reported ORFs to train the model. Taxonomic classification was only performed on coding regions found by BLASTX, by using Blast2.lca (https://github.com/emepyc/Blast2lca#readme). This methodology is based on a Last Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm, which retrieves the most specific taxon associated with the complete set of sequences that hit a certain query, instead of only considering the taxon associated with the closest BLASTX hit, thereby reducing false matches. Eukaryota-related coding regions were filtered out from the analysis based on superkingdom LCA annotation, or on BLASTN searches (0.001 e-value cutoff) against the NCBI-nt eukaryotic subset in the case of those regions identified by the ab initio approach. Finally, to functionally annotate the identified coding regions we used HMMER2 [81] against the TIGRFAMs (9.0 release) database of prokaryotic models [82], considering an e-value cutoff of 0.1. HMMER is a protein profile aligner based on hidden Markov models, with high sensitivity for classifying remote homologs [83].Microbiota richness and diversity We assessed the taxonomic and functional richness and diversity of the microbiota by means of several estimators. In order to eliminate possible artifacts introduced by read count differences between samples, we first used QIIME [84] for resampling an equal number of reads per sample. The richness estimators N and Chao1 [63] and the Shannon diversity index [64] were then calculated using the library ‘vegan’ from the R package [85]. The Chao1 estimator was chosen because it has been shown to be one of the most reliable non-parametric estimators of species richness in species-rich samples [86]. The Shannon index was preferred for species diversity because of its use of natural logarithms of relative species abundances, which reduces the weight of the more abundant species and renders it sensitive to the changes in rare species, which are common in infant gut microbiota samples. Linear regression analyses were executed to determine the statistical significance of the changes in richness and diversity through time, both over all timepoints and in pairwise comparisons for specific time intervals. Because taxon richness is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, we employed the ‘glm’ function implemented in the ‘stats’ R package to fit generalized linear models. On the other hand, values of the Shannon diversity index were parameterized in the standard unit interval (0, 1) and assumed to follow a Beta distribution; therefore we applied the Beta regression model, as implemented in the ‘betareg’ [87] R package. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the temporal profiles of richness and diversity change for individual infants was performed in the ‘pvclust’ R package, which assesses clustering uncertainty by means of multiscale bootstrap resampling [88].Microbiota composition clustering, directionality and dynamics The R package was employed for comparative analyses of taxonomic and functional microbiota composition. Heatmaps and clustering analyses were based on the Bray-Curtis distance as a measure of dissimilarity [65]. Directionality in taxonomic and functional composition change through time was assessed by means of various multivariate analyses. First, we employed global and pairwise analyses of similarities (ANOSIM) adjusted for multiple testing to detect whether there were significant differences between taxonomic or functional profiles per timepoint. ANOSIM tests whether there is a significant difference between two or more groups of samples by comparing distances between sample groups to those within groups. In addition, we also performed “Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance Using Distance Matrices” (PMANOVA or ADONIS), which yielded similar results to the ANOSIM (data not shown). Both analyses used the Bray-Curtis distance to measure dissimilarity in taxonomic or functional microbiota composition between samples. To explore further the pattern of similarities among timepoints we performed Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) using Gower distances [67], for both taxonomic and functional data sets. Once the PCoA analyses were executed, we drew convex hulls enclosing all samples pertaining to a particular timepoint and calculated the area of overlap of the polygons representing each timepoint. The dynamics of individual genera and functions through time were also examined within R. The behavior of different genera was analyzed by means of regression analyses using the Poisson model and the ‘GeneFamilies.regression’ function from the ‘ShotgunFunctionalizeR’ library, and also through the drawing of Venn diagrams containing the taxa per individual, MIP or timepoint, using the ‘venn’ function in the ‘gplots’ library. Venn diagrams were also constructed to identify taxonomic and functional “timecores” containing the taxa or functions shared across all individuals at a given timepoint using the ‘compute.Venn’ function in the ‘Venerable’ library, and to identify those features restricted to single timecores or combinations thereof. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) [89] were constructed for both taxonomic and functional data sets, using the function ‘som’ from the ‘som’ library. These maps are artificial neural networks that use a neighborhood function to separate a complex, high-dimensional input space into a reduced number of discrete groups with unique behaviors through time. In order to get reliable SOM-based clusters we used the bootstrap method. Firstly, we built 200 different sets of resampled temporal profiles for each feature (genus or function) by resampling entire profiles of randomly selected individuals. Then, we carried out a SOM-based clustering over this 200-fold-sized data set. To build clusters at different support levels, we retrieved only those features whose profiles were classified into the same cluster in at least 60% or 80% of the resampling sets.Constructing a dendrogram of genus-level functional profiles Functional profiles were determined for those genera present in any sample at >1% abundance in addition to having genes representing at least 50% of the 108 TIGRFAM functional subroles detected in our complete dataset. Because not enough information was recovered in a sample per sample basis for each genus, the functional profile was established by pooling all the samples of a timepoint. Functional profiles were defined as vectors containing the relative abundances of each one of the 108 TIGRFAM subroles in a particular genus and timepoint. Bray-Curtis distances between functional profiles were computed using the ‘bcdist’ function from the R ‘ecodist’ library, and dendrograms based on these distances were drawn using the ‘hclust’ function from the R ‘stats’ library with the complete-linkage method.Extracting gut microbiota taxa co-occurrence networks from a parent network based on diverse environments We analyzed the relations of the main gut microbiota genera detected in our study within a parent network previously constructed based on the presence/abscence of taxa across a large variety of environments (Pascual-García A, Tamames J, Bastolla U., personal communication). For each infant and maternal timepoint, we considered the group of N taxa observed in all samples of the timepoint (the timecore). For each group we had then N(N-1)/2 putative interactions and we determined those that were present in the parent network, which includes all significant associations among 1187 different genera observed in 2322 samples from very different environments. Details about the environments and their classification can be found in [56]. The parent network was obtained from an adaptation of the null model proposed by Navarro-Alberto and Manly [90] where environmental preferences are considered in order to avoid trivial associations. The null model allows for the generation of random realizations of the original data assuming that taxa are not associated. The significance of putative associations can then be assessed by comparing the results obtained from the observed data versus those obtained from the random ensemble. As the random realizations do not contain information about real associations, any signal coming from the random ensemble is considered a false positive, serving to establish a restrictive threshold for the estimated false positive rate.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Heatmaps and clustering of MA and MB maternal samples according to taxonomic composition (A) and main TIGRFAM functional roles (B) based on Bray-Curtis distances.

The aim of this study was to identify rare copy number variants in individuals with congenital pulmonary atresia (PA). Based on the hypothesis that rare structural variants encompassing key genes play an important role in heart development in PA patients, we performed high-resolution genome-wide microarrays for copy number variations (CNVs) in 82 PA patient-parent trios and 189 controls with an Illumina SNP array platform. CNVs were identified in 17/82 patients (20.7%), and eight of these CNVs (9.8%) are considered potentially pathogenic. Five de novo CNVs occurred at two known congenital heart disease (CHD) loci (16p13.1 and 22q11.2). Two de novo CNVs that may affect folate and vitamin B12 metabolism were identified for the first time. A de novo 1-Mb deletion at 17p13.2 may represent a rare genomic disorder that involves mild intellectual disability and associated facial features. Rare CNVs contribute to the pathogenesis of PA (9.8%), suggesting that the causes of PA are heterogeneous and pleiotropic.

Introduction Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) are the most common birth defects and cause significant morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The incidence of CHD has been estimated at approximately seven per 1000 newborns, which has not changed over the past several decades [1]. Pulmonary atresia (PA) is rare and is one of the most severe cardiac malformations. This condition is characterized by a completely atretic pulmonary valve and the obstruction of blood outflow from the heart to the lungs [2]. PA only accounts for 1% of all CHDs; however, despite tremendous advances in the medical care of CHD patients, PA remains a leading cause of neonatal loss, especially in infants diagnosed with PA with an intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS) [3], [4]. Rare genetic variantions have largely been ignored in the study of complex genetic disorders and other phenotypes [5]–[7], such as cardiovascular diseases, despite the fact that the genetic cause of these diseases remains largely unknown. Recent advances in microarray-based genome profiling analysis have greatly facilitated the delineation of rare de novo copy-number variations (CNVs) that underlie cardiovascular diseases. For example, rare CNVs have become a focus in the exploration of the genetic contributions to tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) [7]–[10], syndromic CHD [11], [12], thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections [13], and long QT syndrome [14]. More than 1700 genes are thought to play integral roles in mouse cardiac development, and homologs of these genes might be candidate genes involved in CHD in humans [15]. However, only a small number of these genes have been found to carry mutations associated with CHD in humans [16]–[18]. One plausible explanation is that mutations in critical genes result in severe birth defects or are lethal to the fetus; thus, these mutations are not found in living individuals with less severe defects [19]. We hypothesized that we would more likely discover rare structural variants that encompass key genes involved in heart development in PA than in TOF or less severe types of CHD. By focusing on one of the most severe types of CHD, PA, and by genotyping 82 patient-parent trios with an Illumina SNP array platform, we detected three previously undescribed genomic lesions: 5q14.1dup (DHFR), 10p13dup (CUBN) and 17p13.2del (CAMTA2).Methods and MaterialsPatient Selection This study was approved by the Review Board of the Second Xiangya Hospital of the Central South University. All probands and their relatives who participated in the study gave written informed consent. All participants consented to this study, and blood samples were collected after receiving written informed consent from the patient's parent or guardian on behalf of the children enrolled. After the screening of more than 6950 patients under age 14 with CHD who were admitted to the Department of Pediatric Cardiology at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, 82 PA patients and their unaffected parents were recruited to this study and began the Cardiac Biospecimen Collection procedure. The patient cohort included 30 males and 52 females from South Central China, with a mean age of 3 years old (range of 10 days to 14 years old). The whole blood samples were collected and stored in the Cardiac Genomic Bank of the Second Xiangya Hospital of the Central South University. Twin studies with congenital malformations are one of the commonly accepted methods for the systematic study of human genetics because twins help elucidate the relationships between genetics, epigenetics, and the environment. Three twin pairs, including two pairs of monozygotic twins and one dizygotic twin pair, were included in this study (Table 1).10.1371/journal.pone.0096471.t001Table 1Three Chinese pair twins with pulmonary atresia and/or tetralogy of Fallot.FamilyCaseStatusAgeSexCHD types1Twin Adizygotic3yFPATwin BPA2Twin Amonozygotic6mFPATwin BTOF3Twin Amonozygotic2yFPATwin BTOF PA, pulmonary atresia; TOF, tetralogy of Fallot; y, years; m, month; F, female Each PA patient and their unaffected parents were assessed using echocardiography, and the diagnosis of PA was further confirmed at the time of surgery. A total of 189 ethnically matched control subjects were also evaluated by echocardiography to exclude CHD.Cytogenetic Analysis The peripheral blood samples from the PA patients and the parents of those patients with potentially pathogenic CNVs were collected from each individual and followed by chromosome analysis using conventional G-banding techniques at the 550 band level. A lymphocyte culture was performed for all samples according to a standard cytogenetic protocol.DNA Extraction Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) on the QIAcube automated DNA extraction robot (Qiagen, Hiden, Germany).CNV Identification and Novelty Assessment Genomic DNA samples from the patients and parents were adjusted to a final concentration of 50 ng/µl. The Human660W-Quad/HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChips (Illumina Inc, San Diego, USA) and Illumina BeadScan genotyping system (Beadstation Scanner) were employed to obtain the signal intensities of SNP probes. The Human660W-Quad contains nearly 660,000 SNP markers, and the HumanOmni1-Quad Beadchip contains over 1.1 million loci, including markers derived from the three HapMap studies, the 1000 Genomes Project and recently published studies [20]. GenomeStudio V2011 software was used to analyze the genotypes (human genome build 37/Hg19 was used for analysis), and the data were further analyzed with a program that included Illumina cnvPartition (V2.3.4) to call the CNVs. To assess the novelty of high-confidence CNVs, we compared their coordinates to known CNVs in the database of Genomic Variants and DECIPHER (Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources). Our raw data for public release have been approved and assigned GEO accession numbers GSE56422 study at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56422. The entries are scheduled to be released on Apr 02, 2014.Real-time Quantitative PCR Validation For eight potentially pathogenic CNVs, at least two primer sets were designed within the boundaries of the CNV region (primers are listed in the Table S1). Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) to validate variable copy numbers. PCR reactions were prepared using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq II PCR reagent kit (TaKaRa Bio, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer pairs were designed using the online PrimerQuest tool from Integrated DNA Technology (http://www.idtdna.com/Primerquest/Home/Index). Amplification levels were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method.Results Eighty-two patients with PA, including three pairs of twins, were included in this study. Among the patients, 77 PA patients with a ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD) and five PA patients with an intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS), were genotyped using SNP-based microarrays. To explore CNVs that are potentially responsible for PA and avoid overestimating the causality of CNVs, we focused on deletions/duplications (copy number 1 or 3 at the autosomes and 0 or 1 at the X chromosome in males and females, respectively) with high confidence. We identified 412 CNVs (256 copy losses and 156 copy gains) with an average of five CNVs (range of 0–28) per patient and an average length of 400,250 bp (range of 59,926–5,217,518 bp). To identify pathogenic CNVs that encompass possible causative genes for CHD, the genes located within the CNVs were analyzed. We identified genomic lesions in 17/82 patients (20.7%), and eight of these CNVs (9.8%) are considered potentially pathogenic. The eight pathogenic or potentially pathogenic CNVs were further validated by Real-time quantitative PCR (Primers are listed in Table S1). Five de novo CNVs occurred at two known congenital heart disease (CHD) loci (16p13.1 and 22q11.2). Three rare CNVs are previously undescribed genomic aberrations: duplication of 5q14.1 (DHFR), duplication of 10p13 (CUBN) and deletion of 17p13.2 (CAMTA2). The results of these potentially pathogenic CNVs are summarized (Table 2).10.1371/journal.pone.0096471.t002Table 2Rare CNVs identified in 82 patients with pulmonary atresia.PatientsLociCopyCNV coordinatesSize(kb)InheritanceCritical GenesStatus8696772q37.1Losschr2:234255714-234415570160De novoDGKD,USP40UKFamily1 TwinA3p26.3-p26.1Losschr3:204652-49443874740Inherited10 genesUK10p15.3-p15.1Gainchr10:59083-52766005180Inherited12 genesUKFamily1TwinB3p26.3-p26.1Losschr3:38411-49443874906Inherited10 genesUK10p15.3-p15.1Gainchr10:103934-52976595172Inherited12 genesUK8176465q13.2Losschr5:68930217-705731271643De novoSMN1/SMN2UK8816785q14.1Gainchr5:75132315-799589454827De novoDHFR,DMGDH,PDE8B,AP3B,ARSBPP8940206p21.33Losschr6:31467185-31569111102De novoNFKBIL1,LTA,TNF,NCR3UK7063466p21.33Losschr6:31467627-31570907103De novoNFKBIL1,LTA,TNF,NCR3UK8750019q33.3GainChr9:127104486-127759670655De novoNR5A1,NR6A1UK76564710p13Gainchr10:16883466-17058324175De novoCUBNPP80741113q33.1Gainchr13:102902377-103345247443De novoFGF14UK89414715q26.3Gainchr15:99004156-99782996779De novoIGF1R,SYNMUK88262416p13.1Gainchr16:15395312-16270740875De novoMYH11,ABCC6,NDE1P79101916p13.3Losschr16:1866643-2604949738De novoABCA3,TSC2,PKD1,TBC1D24UK82797917p13.2Losschr17:4041358-50913771050De novoCAMTA2,CHRNE,GP1BA,ENO3PPFamily2TwinA22q11.2Losschr22:17255869-186926681437De novoTBX1P79526522q11.2Losschr22:17089407-197950502706De novoTBX1P87749422q11.2Losschr22:17101361-198012872700De novoTBX1P74226522q11.2Losschr22:17255869-197950502539De novoTBX1P P, pathogenic; UK, unknown; PP, potentially pathogenic.CNVs Linked to Folate and Vitamin B12 Metabolism We examined whether PA-associated CNVs encompass gene(s) that related to specific genetic pathways and identified two CNVs that encompass genes associated with folate and vitamin B12 metabolism. A 5q14.1 duplication (chr5:75132315-79958945) spanned approximately 4.8 Mb and encompassed DHFR (MIM 126060) and other critical genes, such as PDE8B (MIM 603390), AP3B1 (MIM 603401), ARSB (MIM 611542), and DMGDH (MIM 605849). The other CNV was a 10p13 duplication that is 175 kb in size and affected only one gene, CUBN (MIM 602997) (Figure 1).10.1371/journal.pone.0096471.g001Figure 1Rare CNVs related to folate and Vitamin B12 metabolism.

Adapted from Lee et al [41].CNVs in Twins with PA The patient cohort also included three pairs of twins: one pair of dizygotic twin sisters who both had PA and two monozygotic pairs who were diagnosed with PA or TOF. Identical 3p26.3-26.1 deletions and 10p15.3-p15.1 duplications were identified in the dizygotic twin sisters with PA (family 1, Figure 2). The karyotypes of the twins and their parents were normal according to traditional G-banding analysis (Figure S1). A 22q11.2 deletion (1.5 Mb) was detected in the pair of monozygotic twins from family 2 with discordant CHD subtypes, PA and TOF (Table 1).10.1371/journal.pone.0096471.g002Figure 2CNVs in the dizygotic twin sisters of Family 1. (A) Pedigree of family1 with dizygotic twins with PA. (B) Comparison of CNVs at 3p26.3-p26.1 and 10p15.3-p15.1 locus in twinA, twinB and the healthy mother. A minimal 620-kb duplication at 10p15.3 (chr10:103934-724229) was found in the twin sisters but not presented in the healthy mother. Annotated genes within this region are listed in the lower panel.Other Rare de novo CNVs in PA Rare potentially pathogenic CNVs at 17p13.2del (chr17:4041358-5091377) were observed. The 1-Mb deletion at 17p13.2 spanned four OMIM morbid genes: CHRNE (MIM 100725), GP1BA (MIM 606672), PFN1 (MIM 176610), and ENO3 (MIM 131370) (Figure 3). The single occurrences of five rare CNVs that were observed (three deletions at 2q37.1, 5q13.2, and 16p13.3; and two duplications at 13q33.1 and 15q26.3) might represent benign variants (Table 2). The clinical importance of two recurrent deletions at 6p21.33 remains unknown (Figure S2).10.1371/journal.pone.0096471.g003Figure 3Illumina SNP-array result of the 17p13.2 region in patient 827979.

OMIM genes are highlighted in green, DGV structure variants and Segmental Duplications are also enclosed in the lower panel.Discussion We have presented one of the largest genetic studies investigating the role of rare CNVs in the severe heart defect, PA. The data from 82 PA patient-parent trios and 189 controls were analyzed with a well-defined platform (Human660W-Quad/Omni1-Quad SNP-arrays). Copy number variations were identified in 17/82 patients (20.7%), and eight of these CNVs (9.8%) are considered pathogenic or potentially pathogenic. The overall CNV frequency in our study is consistent with that found in previous studies of isolated or syndromic CHD patients based on different microarray platforms using array comparative genome hybridization or SNP arrays [7], [8], [21]. Previous research suggests that the risk of CHD may be related to genetic variants in folate pathway-related genes [22]–[26]. However, genetic evidence is lacking [27]–[29]. Our study presents evidence for an association between folate-related genes and a specific subtype of CHD (PA) in humans. We have identified two potentially pathogenic CNVs linked to folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM). One CNV is a 4.8-Mb duplication on 5q14.1 that contains DHFR, and another CNV is a 10p13 duplication that affects only one gene, CUBN. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a key folate-metabolizing enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF), as well as folic acid to DHF [30]. Several groups have shown that inhibiting the expression of DHFR results in embryonic lethality in zebrafish. Interestingly, the anatomic malformations observed with PA in humans are consistent with the defects in the outflow tract in the zebrafish model [31], [32]. Cubilin, encoded by CUBN, is a receptor expressed in the apical pole of absorptive epithelia [33], and it plays an important role in the absorption of vitamin B12 [34]. The interactions between folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine are summarized in Figure 1C. Both potentially pathogenic CNVs are duplications, implying that the association of CHD with these genes might be dosage-sensitive. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms linking FOCM to birth defects, such as CHD, remain unknown. Two dizygotic twin sisters of family 1 shared an identical 3p26.3-26.1 deletion and a 10p15.3-p15.1 duplication, while the karyotypes of the twins and their parents were normal at 550 band resolution (Figure S1). The 3p26.3-p26.1 deletion spanned approximately 4.9 Mb and affected more than 10 genes, including SUMF1, ITPR1, and CRBN. The 5.1-Mb duplication at 10p15.3-p15.1 contained several disease-causing genes, such as KLF6, AKR1C2, and AKR1C4. Fine mapping of these two genomic regions (3p26.3-26.1 and 10p15.3-p15.1) revealed that the twins with PA carry a larger duplication at the terminus of chromosome 10p than their healthy mother (Figure 2B). Recently, Tremblay et al. mapped a gene associated with ventricular aneurysms and septal defects to chromosomal loci (10p15.3-p15.2) using classic familial linkage analysis [35]. This evidence collectively suggests that the 620-kb region at chromosomal 10p15.3 (chr10:103934-724229) may represent a plausible CNV with causative genes for CHD. Two other de novo CNVs, one with an 875-kb duplication at 16p13.1 (chr16:15395312-16270740) and the other with a 1-Mb deletion at the 17p13.2 locus (chr17:4041358-5091377), were found in only one individual with PA. Of the 12 genes contained in the 16p13.1 region, MYH11 has been previously associated with heart disease. Mutations in MYH11 cause thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection, and recurrent 16p13.1 duplications confer a risk for aortic dissection [7], [13], [36]. The 1-Mb deletion at 17p13.2 covers a gene-rich region (with 30 annotated genes), suggesting that this CNV is potentially pathogenic. In this 17p13.2 deleted region, the gene CAMTA2, designated as calmodulin binding transcription activator 2, is part of a family of activators of the ANF promoter. Camta2 has been shown to interact with Nkx2-5 and promote cardiac hypertrophy in mice [37]. For this reason, CAMTA2 is an appropriate candidate gene for CHD that is caused by a 17p13.2 deletion disorder. The 17p13.2 deletion is rarely reported in the literature, and thus far, only two 17p13 deletions [38], [39] and one 17p13 duplication [40] have been reported in patients with intellectual disability. A re-evaluation of this individual with the 17p13.2 deletion identified mild intellectual disability, hypotonia, and subtle facial features, raising the possibility of a previously unrecognized microdeletion disorder. In summary, we identified eight rare de novo CNVs (9.8%) in patients with PA including three previously undescribed CNVs: 5q14.1dup (DHFR), 10p13dup (CUBN) and 17p13.2del (CAMTA2). Our results suggest that rare CNVs likely contribute significantly to the genetic basis of cardiovascular diseases, such as PA. Our study provides evidence for the association of CHD with FOCM. The discovery of previously undescribed rare CNVs in patients with CHD helps elucidate critical gene(s) for CHD and may provide new insights into understanding the pathogenesis of CHD.Supporting InformationFigure S1 G-banded karyotype analysis of the twin family 1.

Introduction Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and disabling brain disease, affecting approximately one percent of the population worldwide [1]. The overt signs and symptoms of schizophrenia do not usually manifest until late adolescence but it is believed that the disorder arises from genetic and/or environmental factors encountered prior to disease onset. Amongst the early insults that increase the risk for schizophrenia, prenatal exposure to viral or bacterial infection has been implicated as a strong risk factor by epidemiological studies [2]. The mechanisms by which brain development is altered in offspring following maternal infection remain unknown but it appears that maternal immune activation and in particular proinflammatory cytokines produced in order to fight the infection, rather the infection per se, is responsible [3–5]. Although late risk factors have been difficult to identify, various lines of evidence suggest an association between cannabis use in adolescence and the onset of schizophrenia symptoms. Cannabis increases the risk for psychotic outcomes in a dose-response manner [6]. However, only a minority of cannabis users develop psychosis suggesting that cannabis may interact with other genetic and/or environmental susceptibilities in order to precipitate the disorder (“two hit” hypothesis). Besides its involvement in depressive illness, serotonin (5HT) insufficiency has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia [7]. The serotonin 5HT1A receptor (5HT1AR) has been implicated in both the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia [7]. Postmortem studies have reported increased 5HT1AR density in several brain regions [8–10]. Recent pharmacological advances indicate that the 5HT1AR may be a promising target for alleviating antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms and cognitive/affective (e.g., anxiety and depression) disorders in schizophrenia [11]. In animal studies, decreased 5HT levels have been reported in several brain regions of offspring following perinatal exposure to agents that induce immune system activation, for example, the viral and bacterial mimics polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (poly I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [5, 12, 13]. Decreased 5HT turnover in the hippocampus of mice has been observed after prenatal poly I:C treatment [14]. Treatment with risperidone, which possesses serotonergic antagonistic properties, during the prodromal-like period can prevent the emergence of abnormal behaviours and associated structural brain pathology in the hippocampus of rats exposed to poly I:C in utero [15]. Furthermore, administration of fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, attenuates prepulse inhibition deficits and enhances amphetamine sensitivity in the poly I:C mouse model [16]. Alterations in the development of the serotoninergic system may, therefore, represent a means by which maternal immune activation causes pathological changes in brain development and behaviour in offspring relevant to schizophrenia. Animal studies suggest that cannabinoids also interact with 5HT mechanisms. Cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) agonists suppress electrically and calcium-stimulated 5HT release from cortical slices [17] and in the hippocampus, delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been shown to inhibit 5HT release [18]. Conversely, CB1R antagonists stimulate 5HT release in the medial prefrontal cortex [19]. Other studies suggest that administration of cannabinoids impairs 5HT-mediated behaviours in laboratory animals [20]. We have previously shown that treatment with the synthetic cannabinoid HU210 increased 5HT1AR binding (measured 24 hours after the last injection) in the brain of adult but not adolescent rats suggesting different adaptive responses in the two age groups [21]. In the present study, we examined the impact of prenatal immune challenge by the viral mimic poly I:C (first hit) alone and in combination with adolescent HU210 exposure (“two hit” model) on 5HT1AR binding in the cortex and hippocampus of late adolescent, young adult and adult rats. We hypothesised that maternal immune activation will alter serotonergic binding in the developing rat brain and that these alterations may also be affected by adolescent cannabinoid exposure. We found that poly I:C treatment alone increased 5HT1AR binding in the hippocampus at all developmental points, an effect that was strengthened by cannabinoid treatment in the “two hit” model.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Animals Pregnant Wistar rat dams were sourced from the Animal Resource Centre, Perth, Australia. The animals were kept at a constant temperature of 22 ± 2°C on a 12–12 h light-dark cycle with lights on at 09.00 am and were handled during the seven days preceding poly I:C treatment. All handling of animals and procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation.2.2. Prenatal Poly I:C Treatment On embryonic day (ED) 15, pregnant rat dams were placed in a restraint device and received either a single intravenous (i.v.) injection of 4 mg/kg poly I:C (purchased from Sigma, Australia) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, n = 4) or an equivalent volume of PBS (n = 4). Treatment of rats and experimental design is summarised in Figure 1. Injections were administered at a volume of 1 mL/kg. Blood was collected from the tail vein 2 hours postinjection into EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) coated microtainers (purchased from Becton Dickinson). Rats were then weighed in the four days following the i.v. injections. Litter sizes ranged from 4 to 14 pups. On PND 21, pups were weaned and dams were euthanized. Blood was again collected from dams at the point of euthanasia.2.3. Adolescent HU210 Treatment of Offspring On PND 27, male offspring were divided into the following 4 treatment groups: (1) vehicle only: prenatal PBS with adolescent vehicle exposure (VEH-VEH), (2) adolescent HU210 only: prenatal PBS (Phosphate buffered saline) with adolescent HU210 (VEH-HU210), (3) poly I:C only: prenatal poly I:C with adolescent vehicle (POLY-VEH), (4) “two hit” group of prenatal poly I:C with adolescent HU210 (POLY-HU210), see Figure 1. They were housed 3-4 per cage and were handled during the seven days preceding HU210/vehicle treatment. Treatment of adolescent rats began on PND 35. The synthetic cannabinoid, HU210 (Sapphire Laboratories, Australia), was dissolved in a vehicle solution of Tween 80 : dimethyl sulfoxide : saline (1 : 1 : 98). Rats in the adolescent HU210 groups (VEH-HU210 and POLY-HU210) received daily intraperitoneal injections of 100 μg/kg HU210 for 14 days. Rats in the adolescent vehicle groups (VEH-VEH and POLY-VEH) received vehicle solution for the treatment period. Injections were administered at a volume of 1 mL/kg. Animals were euthanized on PNDs 55, 65, and 90 (n = 6–8 per treatment group at each time point) corresponding to late adolescence, early adulthood and adulthood, respectively, in rats [22, 23]. Blood was collected at the point of euthanasia on PND 55 and 65. Brains were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Coronal brain sections (16 μm) were cut with a cryostat and thaw mounted onto microscope slides.2.4. Analysis of Plasma Cytokine and Corticosterone Levels Following collection, blood was centrifuged for 20 min at 1000 g at 4°C. Plasma was collected and frozen at −80°C until assayed. Plasma TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations were assessed using a Quantikine Rat IL-6, and Quantikine Rat TNF-α Immunoassay kit, respectively (R&D Systems, USA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed according to kit instructions. The mean recovery of TNF-α in plasma is reported to be 96% with a mean inter- and intra-assay variability of 9.36% and 3.13%. The mean recovery of IL-6 in plasma is reported to be 96% with a mean inter- and intra-assay variability of 9.31% and 3.11%, respectively. Plasma corticosterone concentrations were assessed using a rat corticosterone 125I radioimmunoassay kit (MP Biomedicals, USA). The recovery of exogenous corticosterone is 100%, with a mean inter- and intra-assay variability of 4.4% and 6.5%, respectively.2.5. Autoradiography Binding for 5HT1AR was carried using [3H]8-OH-DPAT. Sections were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mM NaCl and 4 mM CaCl2. Sections were then incubated for 60 min at room temperature in the same buffer with the addition of 2 nM [3H]8-OH-DPAT (specific activity 170.2 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer, USA). Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating adjacent sections in 2 nM [3H]8-OH-DPAT in the presence of 10 μM MM 77 dihydrochloride. After this incubation, sections were washed twice for 10 min each in ice cold buffer, followed by one dip in ice-cold distilled water and then dried. Sections were opposed to Kodak Biomax MR films, together with autoradiographic standards ([3H] microscales from Amersham), in X-ray film cassettes. Films were exposed for 49 days and were then developed and fixed using Kodak GBX developer and fixer.2.6. Quantitative Analysis of Autoradiographic Images Films were analyzed by using a computer-assisted image analysis system, Multi-Analyst, connected to a GS-690 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad, USA). Quantification of binding was performed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the primary somatosensory cortex, layers I–III (CTXUP) and layers IV–VI (CTXDO), by measuring the average optical density in adjacent sections. Nonspecific binding was subtracted from the total binding to determine the specific binding. Optical density measurements for specific binding were then converted into fmoles [3H]8-OH-DPAT per mg tissue equivalent (fmol/mg TE), according to the calibration curve obtained from the tritiated standards.2.7. Statistical Analysis The effect of treatment on body weight over time was analyzed in pregnant dams using two-way ANOVA (body weight × day) with repeated measures and Bonferroni's post hoc tests. Cytokines and corticosterone levels in poly I:C treated pregnant rat dams were compared with controls using a Student's t-test. Cytokines and corticosterone levels were compared in offspring using one-way ANOVA with LSD post hoc tests. Two-way ANOVA with treatment and brain region as independent variables, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, was conducted on each postnatal time point in order to identify overall statistically significant variations in binding in hippocampus CA1 and cortical subregions assessed on PNDs 55, 65, and 90 across all treatment groups. Data was analysed using GraphPad Prism (CA, USA) and PASW Statistics 18 (IL, USA) statistical packages.3. Results3.1. Effect of Poly I:C Treatment on Body Weight in Pregnant Dams A significant effect of day (F(3,18) = 59.53, P < 0.0001) but not treatment (F(1,18) = 0.4881, P = 0.5109) was observed when weight gain was compared over the four days posttreatment. Directly after injection, however, poly I:C treated dams gained an average of 0.3% body weight compared to vehicle-treated animals that gained 1.2% between ED 15 and 16 (Figure 2).3.2. Plasma Cytokines and Corticosterone Levels in Pregnant Dams Poly I:C at the dose of 4 mg/kg i.v. provoked a systemic immune response. Plasma cytokines and corticosterone concentrations were assayed in pregnant rats on ED15, 2 hours after poly I:C treatment and at the point of euthanasia, 27 days posttreatment. Poly I:C injection on ED15 caused statistically significant increases in TNF-α (P = 0.005), IL-6 (P = 0.012) and corticosterone (P = 0.05) levels compared to PBS-treated rats (Figure 3). Cytokines and corticosterone levels had returned to baseline in poly I:C treated dams 27 days after injection (Figure 3).3.3. Plasma Cytokine and Corticosterone Levels in Offspring on PND 55 and 65 One-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of treatment (F(3,23) = 4.982, P = 0.008) on TNF-α levels on PND 55. Poly I:C treated rats had higher levels of TNF-α compared to vehicle-treated rats (P = 0.02) and adolescent HU210 treated rats (P = 0.001). The “two hit” group had also higher TNF-α compared to adolescent HU210 group (P = 0.047), see Table 1. No significant effects of treatment on TNF-α levels were observed on PND 65 (Table 1). No significant effects of treatment on corticosterone and IL-6 levels were observed on PND 55 or 65.3.4. [3H]8-OH-DPAT Binding in Offspring on PNDs 55, 65 and 90 Two-way ANOVA at each developmental age revealed a significant effect of treatment on 5HT1A binding, a significant effect of region and a significant interaction between them on all PNDs 55, 65, and 90 (Table 2). Post hoc analysis revealed that this significant interaction was due to significant treatment effects in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Table 3, Figures 4 and 5). More specifically, poly I:C only (first hit) treated offspring showed increases of 15–18% (0.0001 < P < 0.05) in binding compared to their respective controls at all developmental ages. Poly I:C treated animals that were also exposed to HU210 during adolescence (“two hit” group) displayed even greater increases in binding in the CA1 compared to controls at all ages (PND 55: 44%, P < 0.001; PND 65: 29%, P < 0.001; PND 90: 39%, P < 0.001). Two hit animals had also higher levels of binding compared to animals exposed to HU210 only at all developmental ages (PND 55: 41%, P < 0.001; PND 65: 16%, P < 0.05; PND 90: 45%, P < 0.001), and higher levels of binding compared to poly I:C only group on PNDs 55 (23%, P < 0.001) and 90 (21%, P < 0.001). Levels of binding in rats exposed to HU210 alone in adolescence did not significantly differ compared to controls at any time point.4. Discussion Using a novel two hit model of environment-related psychopathology, the current study demonstrated that maternal immune activation (induced by maternal poly I:C treatment at ED15), alone and in combination with adolescent cannabinoid treatment of offspring, had region-specific and long-lasting effects on 5HT1AR binding in the developing rat brain that is, in late adolescent, young adult and adult rats. In particular, an additive effect of poly I:C and HU210 treatment was observed in the hippocampus which resulted in a strong upregulation of 5HT1AR binding in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Importantly, cannabinoid treatment alone during adolescence had no effects on binding at any of the developmental points examined. To examine whether poly I:C treatment provoked a systemic immune response, we evaluated the presence of TNF-α, IL-6 and corticosterone in the maternal blood 2 hours after poly I:C injection. We observed robust increases in maternal cytokines and corticosterone levels indicative of activation of the maternal immune system. Offspring of poly I:C treated dams also displayed increased levels of plasma TNF-α at PND 55 mirroring alterations in cytokines levels reported in people with schizophrenia [24]. Our results are in line with studies in animals showing that maternal inflammation during gestation leads to anatomical changes in the hippocampus of offspring and alterations in specific behaviours that depend on that structure [15, 25]. Piontkewitz and collaborators [15] have shown, for example, that treatment with risperidone, a serotonergic receptor antagonist, during adolescence prevents the decrease in hippocampal volume caused by prenatal poly I:C in rats. Our results are also in line with postmortem human studies showing elevated 5HT1AR binding in the hippocampus in schizophrenia [9] although binding has been shown to be unaffected in another study [26]. A series of human and animal studies suggest that antagonism of 5HT1AR provides benefits in treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia [11]. For example, the new antipsychotic lurasidone combined with a 5HT1AR antagonist (weak partial agonist) action [27] has been shown to improve the learning and memory impairment induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 [28] and to ameliorate the cognitive impairment in schizophrenia patients [29]. Besides its involvement in depressive illness, 5HT insufficiency has been suggested to play an important role on the pathogenesis of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia [7]. One of the emerging mechanisms linking enhanced proinflammatory activity with the induction of affective emotional and social impairment is the central tryptophan metabolism [30]. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid needed for the biosynthesis of 5HT. Enhanced proinflammatory actions in the central nervous system lead to increased tryptophan degradation into kynurenine by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase thereby reducing the bioavailability of tryptophan for 5HT synthesis [30]. Consistent with this, decreases in hippocampal levels of 5HT have been reported in mice following prenatal poly I:C and human influenza exposure [5, 12] and in rat offspring after immune system activation induced by LPS treatment [13]. In the current study, poly I:C treatment alone had profound effects on the 5HT1AR in the hippocampus causing a 15–17% increase in binding in the CA1 on PND 55, 65, and 90. It is, therefore, tempting to hypothesise that this increase (first hit) reflects an adaptive mechanism to compensate for decreased 5HT levels induced by maternal immune system activation. Our results suggest that cannabis exposure alone during adolescence is not a sufficient factor to induce developmental changes in the integrity of the 5HT1AR system in the hippocampus. Offspring of poly I:C treated rats that were exposed to cannabinoid treatment during adolescence (two hit group) displayed however increases of larger magnitude (29–44%) in hippocampal 5HT1AR binding compared to the poly I:C alone group. This finding indicates that cannabis during adolescence can exacerbate neural vulnerabilities which have been laid down early in life, thus enhancing neurochemical outcomes relevant to schizophrenia in adulthood. It is likely that prenatal immune challenge affects the integrity of the serotoninergic system making it vulnerable to subsequent cannabinoid exposure in adolescence. Interestingly, previous studies in adult rodents have shown that, in the hippocampus, THC and the CB1R agonist WIN 55, 212-2 decreased 5HT synthesis [31], and 5HT release was suppressed by THC administration [18]. Based on the above studies it is possible that increased 5HT1AR binding in the “two hit” group is a compensatory response for 5HT deficiency induced by prenatal poly I:C exposure that is subsequently exacerbated by cannabinoid treatment in adolescence. Clearly more research is required to test this hypothesis. The neurochemical alterations observed in both poly I:C and poly I:C/cannabinoid groups in our study lend weight to the “two hit” hypothesis for mental illness, although our study is limited by the absence of functional studies that would be invaluable. Despite this limitation, the current results are presented to further stimulate interest in studies looking at the interactions of early (prenatal) inflammatory effects with late (adolescent) insults (e.g., stress and cannabis) in producing schizophrenia-related functional and/or neurochemical outcomes, an area of research that is a growing field of interest [3, 14, 32]5. Conclusions Poly I:C treatment at ED15 results in immune system activation and abnormal elevation of 5HT1AR binding in the hippocampus of late adolescent, young adult and adult offspring. Adolescent cannabinoid exposure alone is not a sufficient factor to alter the integrity of the 5HT1AR system, but when combined with poly I:C leads to greater elevations in binding compared to poly I:C alone. Our results support the biological plausibility for a synergistic effect of prenatal infection and cannabis in adolescence and lead weight to the “two hit” hypothesis for mental illness.

An important receptor that mediates the effects of dietary lipids on gene expression is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), which is abundantly expressed in enterocytes. In this study we examined the effects of acute nutritional activation of PPARα on expression of genes encoding intestinal barrier proteins. To this end we used triacylglycerols composed of identical fatty acids in combination with gene expression profiling in wild-type and PPARα-null mice. Treatment with the synthetic PPARα agonist WY14643 served as reference. We identified 74 barrier genes that were PPARα-dependently regulated 6 hours after activation with WY14643. For eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and oleic acid (OA) these numbers were 46, 41, and 19, respectively. The overlap between EPA-, DHA-, and WY14643-regulated genes was considerable, whereas OA treatment showed limited overlap. Functional implications inferred form our data suggested that nutrient-activated PPARα regulated transporters and phase I/II metabolic enzymes were involved in a) fatty acid oxidation, b) cholesterol, glucose, and amino acid transport and metabolism, c) intestinal motility, and d) oxidative stress defense. We identified intestinal barrier genes that were PPARα-dependently regulated after acute activation by fatty acids. This knowledge provides a better understanding of the impact dietary fat has on the barrier function of the gut, identifies PPARα as an important factor controlling this key function, and underscores the importance of PPARα for nutrient-mediated gene regulation in intestine.

Background The small intestine is the primary site for digestion and selective absorption of nutrients and other food constituents. Absorption of these molecules across the intestinal epithelium is mediated mainly by multiple transmembrane transporters that principally belong to two superfamilies, namely the solute carrier (SLC) and the ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters. SLC transporters located at the apical membrane of enterocytes are responsible for the selective uptake of macronutrients, such as di- and tripeptides, hexoses and fatty acids [1]. In contrast, ABC transporters are efflux transporters responsible for the active removal of substances, including nutrients such as cholesterol, regulating their intracellular concentrations [2]. Besides their presence in plasma membranes, SLC and ABC transporters are also located in intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria or peroxisomes, thus regulating intracellular and transcellular solute transport. In addition, it has become clear that the small intestine is an important metabolic active organ, to a great extend responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nutrients and xenobiotics [3,4]. Numerous metabolic reactions occur in enterocytes, including those typically referred to as phase I and phase II metabolism. Phase I metabolism includes oxidative, peroxidative, and reductive metabolism of endogenous compounds and drugs, mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CypP450s) [5]. Phase II metabolism often succeeds phase I metabolism and yields mainly more hydrophilic metabolites, mostly by conjugation, thereby increasing the water solubility of lipophilic compounds. The most important phase II enzymes are sulfotransferases (Sults) [6,7], UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (Ugts) [8], glutathione S-transferases (Gsts) [9,10], N-acetyltransferases (Nats) [11], and epoxide hydrolases (Ephs) [12]. Several ABC transporters are responsible for the excretion of metabolites resulting from phase I and phase II enzymatic transformations [2]. There is increasing interest in the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial or adverse effects of foods and food components. Nutrients impact gene expression mainly by activating or suppressing specific transcription factors [13,14]. The most important group of transcription factors involved in mediating the effect of nutrients and their metabolites on gene transcription is the superfamily of nuclear receptors, which consists of 48 members in the human genome [15]. This superfamily is subdivided into six families [16], of which the NR1 family is most relevant to nutrition. One important group of receptors that mediates the effects of dietary fatty acids and its derivatives on gene expression are the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs, NR1C) [16-18]. Three PPAR isotypes, α (NR1C1), δ (also called β) (NR1C2), and γ (NR1C3) are distinguished and characterized by different biological roles. Transcriptional regulation by PPARs requires heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXR; NR2B) [16,19,20]. When activated by an agonist, the PPAR/RXR heterodimer stimulates transcription via binding to DNA response elements (PPREs) present in and around the promoter of target genes. Besides upregulating gene expression, PPARs are also able to repress transcription by directly interacting with other transcription factors and interfere with their signaling pathways, a mechanism commonly referred to as transrepression [21]. PPARα has been shown to be expressed at a high level in the small intestine [22]. Moreover, the average Western diet contains a high amount of triacylglycerols [23] that are hydrolyzed to monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids before entering the enterocyte [24]. As a result the small intestine is frequently exposed to high levels of natural PPARα agonists. However, currently little is known about the effects of PPARα activation by dietary fats on gene expression in small intestine. Although in several studies small intestinal gene expression was studied after high-fat feeding [25-27], the specific role of PPARα remains to be elucidated. Here, we take advantage of a unique experimental design using triglycerides composed of identical fatty acids in combination with gene expression profiling to examine the effects of individual dietary fatty acids on intestinal gene expression in mice. By conducting these experiments in wild-type and PPARα -/- mice, and by limiting the exposure time to 6 hours, we were able to elucidate the specific, direct contribution of PPARα in regulating the expression of transport and phase I/II metabolism genes in small intestine.Results and discussionEffect of acute PPARα activation with OA, EPA, DHA and WY14643 In this study we investigated the role of PPARα on the expression of genes encoding for transport proteins and phase I/II metabolic enzymes, collectively called barrier proteins, which are responsible for the selective absorption and metabolism of food components. Since we are specifically interested in the role PPARα plays in nutrient-mediated gene regulation, we used and compared in our studies 3 natural agonists normally found in the diet [oleic acid (OA, C18:1), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6)]. As reference we used the synthetic agonist WY14643. We analyzed gene expression 6 hours after oral gavage, thus we primarily studied the direct effects of PPARα activation. This time point was chosen because in a pilot experiment we found that after an oral fat load plasma triacylglycerol levels peaked at 2–3 hours post loading and almost returned to basal levels after 6 hours (data not shown), indicating that at that point most of the fat bolus has passed through the enterocytes, and sufficient time remained for transcriptional events to occur. Expression of transport and phase I/II metabolism genes (barrier genes) was studied using microarrays. The Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array comprised of 45,038 probesets, representing 16,579 unique genes. Annotation information from Affymetrix was queried to compile a list of transport and phase I/II metabolism genes present on the array (for details, see methods section). This set consisted of 944 probesets, encoding for 529 unique genes, and was used throughout all analyses. We identified 9,426 significantly expressed genes in small intestine, of which 264 were barrier genes. As expected, of all agonists used in this study, acute treatment with WY14643 provoked the most pronounced response, both with respect to the number of regulated genes and the magnitude of the fold changes. Treatment with WY14643 resulted in the PPARα-specific differential expression of 74 transport and phase I/II metabolism genes (Table 1), of which 32 were expressed at higher levels and 42 genes were reduced in wild-type mice compared to PPARα-null mice (for the full list of regulated genes please see additional data, Table 1). On the other hand, treatment of wild-type and PPARα-null mice with OA identified only 19 PPARα-dependently regulated barrier genes (Table 1). Of these, 13 were induced and 6 repressed (additional data, Table 2). Treatment with EPA and DHA resulted in 46 and 41 PPARα-dependently regulated barrier genes, respectively (Table 1). Activation of PPARα by EPA increased the expression of 32 genes and suppressed 14 genes (additional data, Table 3), whereas for DHA these numbers were 22 and 19, respectively (additional data, Table 4).Table 1 Number of PPARα-dependently regulated genes after treatment with different agonistsOAEPADHAWY14643All genesBarrier genesAll genesBarrier genesAll genesBarrier genesAll genesBarrier genesNumber of PPARα-dependent regulated genes508198744689441121874Percentage5.47.29.317.49.515.512.928.0 Number of PPARα-dependently regulated genes and corresponding percentages for all genes and the barrier gene set after activation with OA, EPA, DHA, and WY14643. The percentages relate to the total number of expressed genes (9,426) and all barrier genes (264), respectively. In Bünger et al [22] we reported that under basal (control) conditions only 21 genes were differentially expressed in small intestine of wild-type mice compared to PPARα-null mice. The currently investigated barrier gene set includes 2 of these genes, Slc25a20 and Cyp4a10, which were both expressed at lower levels in the null mice. We found that expression of Slc25a20 was only slightly elevated after acute treatment with WY14643, EPA, and DHA, which indicates that the regulation of Slc25a20 by PPARα may be of less relevance during (nutritional) activation of PPARα. In contrast, the fold induction of Cyp4a10 observed after acute treatment with WY14643, EPA and DHA was much larger than the basal difference, which implies that for this gene activation of PPARα is of importance. When comparing the list of barrier genes that were PPARα-dependently regulated after acute treatment with WY14643 with that of a long-term (5 day) exposure experiment [22], we found an overlap of 74% (additional data, Table 5). This indicates that short-term regulation evoked with synthetic agonists is maintained for at least 5 days. Hirai et al [28] very recently reported their study in which they identified seven nutrient and drug transporters that were PPARα-dependently regulated in small intestine after 3 days exposure to two synthetic agonists. In concordance with their data, we found that all except 2 of these transporters were regulated after acute treatment with WY14643 as well. In addition, we observed that these carriers were also PPARα-dependently regulated by DHA and EPA. Like Hirai et al, we did not observe a PPARα-dependent regulation of Pept1 (Slc15a1), the first intestinal nutrient transporter shown to be PPARα-dependently regulated during fasting [28,29]. To characterize the importance of PPARα in controlling expression of small intestinal transporters and phase I/II metabolic enzymes, we compared the fraction of PPARα-dependently regulated genes of the barrier gene set with that observed for all genes (Table 1). For treatment with OA the percentages were 7.2% and 5.4%, respectively, for the set of barrier genes and all expressed genes. This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). However, the other two natural agonists showed a significantly higher percentage of regulated genes for the barrier gene set than for all genes; for EPA this percentage was 9.3% for all genes, whereas 17.4% of the barrier genes were regulated (p < 0.001). For DHA these percentages were 9.5% and 15.5% respectively (p < 0.001). For WY14643 we observed an even larger difference between all genes and the barrier gene set; 12.9% respectively 28.0% of the genes were regulated in a PPARα-dependent manner (p < 0.001). These results imply that PPARα plays an important role in regulating small intestinal gene expression of transporter and phase I/II metabolic enzymes.Overlap between OA, EPA, DHA and WY14643 treatment We also determined the overlap of PPARα-dependently regulated genes between the different treatments. Most of the genes regulated upon treatment with OA were not regulated by DHA and EPA (Figure 1A) or WY14643 (data not shown). Only four genes, i.e. Slc27a4 (Fatp4), Cyp4F16, Cyp2c65, and Abcd3 were regulated upon all 4 treatments. For these genes additional qRT-PCR analyses were performed, which confirmed the array results (Table 2). There was considerable overlap between the genes affected by EPA, DHA or WY14643 treatment (Figure 1B). These overlapping genes behaved the same in all treatments, i.e. they were either increased or suppressed in wild-type compared to PPARα-null mice upon all treatments. In Table 6 of the additional data the complete list of overlapping genes is presented. It is likely that OA treatment affected fewer genes, because the mice may be adapted to this fatty acid since they were fed a diet based on olive oil three weeks before gavage (for details, see methods section). In addition, it is generally accepted that polyunsaturated fatty acids activate PPARα better than monounsaturated fatty acids [30-33], which is in line with our result that OA activated less genes PPARα-dependently than EPA and DHA. Although the overlap between WY14643-, EPA-, and DHA-regulated genes was high, we still observed differential gene activation between these treatments. The exact mechanism(s) underlying these differences are currently unclear, but we speculate this may be partially due to the differential recruitment of coactivators such as Src-1, Med1, Pgc1α, and p300 by the three agonists [34-37]. Alternatively, hitherto unknown additional signaling routes not shared by the three agonists may exist.Table 2 Confirmation of microarray resultsWY14643EPADHAOAGene symbolFC (MA)FC (qPCR)FC (MA)FC (qPCR)FC (MA)FC (qPCR)FC (MA)FC (qPCR)Fatp4 (Slc27a4)1.7 (0.24)2.2 (0.28)*1.5 (0.14)1.7 (0.30)*1.4 (0.14)1.5 (0.09)*1.4 (0.16)1.6 (0.41)*Abcd32.8 (0.38)4.9 (0.75)*1.7 (0.11)2.0 (0.28)*1.8 (0.08)2.7 (0.50)*1.4 (0.10)2.0 (0.22)*Cyp2c652.6 (0.34)3.7 (0.69)*2.3 (0.24)2.8 (0.51)*2.5 (0.48)3.9 (1.13)*1.7 (0.23)2.7 (0.94)*Cyp4F161.9 (0.36)2.0 (0.44)*1.5 (0.14)1.3 (0.30)*1.4 (0.17)1.5 (0.25)*1.9 (0.34)2.5 (0.36)* Microarray results were confirmed with qPCR.

A) Overlap between OA, EPA and DHA, B) Overlap between EPA, DHA, and WY14643.Functional implications of acute PPARα activation in small intestine A summary of functional outcomes of PPARα activation by the agonists inferred from our data is presented in table 3. Although in this study we only determined mRNA levels, it has been reported that for the majority of genes the mRNA levels reflect protein abundance very well [38,39]. We therefore allow ourselves to speculate about the functional consequences of nutritional PPARα activation. Nevertheless, these implications should ultimately be evaluated in follow-up studies.Table 3 Overview of regulated processesGene symbolProbeset IDFC WYFC EPAFC DHAFC OAFunctionFatty acid oxidationFatp4 (Slc27a4)1424441_at1.71.51.41.4Apical long chain FA uptake [76]Cact (Slc25a20)1423109_s_at6.82.62.4ncCarnitine cycle in mitochondrial β-oxidation [62]Octn2 (Slc22a5)1421848_at7.73.24.2ncApical carnitine uptake for mitochondrial β-oxidation [48]Fatp2 (Slc27a2)1416316_at2.21.6ncncHas acyl CoA properties to activate FA for subsequent peroxisomal β-oxidation [86]Abcd31416679_at2.81.71.81.4Transport of VLFA over the peroxisomal membrane for peroxisomal β-oxidation [77]Cyp4a101424853_s_at1447.2120.2160.3ncω-oxidation [87]Cyp4b11416194_at1.7ncncncω-oxidation [87, 88]Cyp4f161417277_at1.91.51.41.9ω-oxidation [89, 90]G6pt1 (Slc37a4)1417042_at-1.5ncncncGlycogenolysis [91]Nadc1 (Slc13a2)1418857_at-2.1-2.2ncncDicarboxylates uptake for Krebs cycle [92]Cholesterol fluxNpc1l11438514_at-1.5-1.4-1.6ncApical cholesterol uptake [93]Abca11450392_at12.13.2ncncBasolateral cholesterol efflux [56, 58]Glucose transportSglt1 (Slc5a1)1455431_at-1.4ncncncApical glucose uptake [94]Glut2 (Slc2a2)1449067_at-1.4ncncncBasolateral glucose efflux [95]Glut1 (Slc2a1)1426599_a_at-1.5ncncncGlucose transport [95]Sglt4 (Slc5a9)1439494_at-1.7-1.7-2.0ncGlucose + mannose transport [96]Amino acid metabolismEaac1 (Slc1a1)1448299_at-1.4ncncncApical glutamate uptake [97]Pat1 (Slc36a1)1428793_atnc-1.6-1.8ncApical neutral amino acids uptake [98]Lat2 (Slc7a8)1417929_at-1.6-1.6-2.0ncBasolateral neutral amino acids efflux [99]Tat1 (Slc16a10)1436368_at-1.7-1.4-1.8ncBasolateral aromatic amino acids efflux [100]y+Lat1 (Slc7a7)1447181_s_at1.5ncncncBasolateral cationic amino acids efflux [99]Aralar1 (Slc25a12)1428440_at-1.3ncncncMalate-aspartate shuttle: provides cytosolic aspartate [62]Intestinal motilitySert (Slc6a4)1417150_at-1.4-1.2-1.3ncSerotonine uptake [66]Dat1 (Slc6a3)1417415_atnc1.8nc2.6Dopamine uptake [68]Nas1 (Slc13a1)1430804_at-2.1-2.0nc-2.3Apical sulphate uptake [101]Oxidative stressDic (Slc25a10)1416954_at1.61.5ncncPyruvate metabolism [62]Kmcp1 (Slc25a30)1420836_at5.5ncncnc?Mct13 (Slc16a13)1453056_at10.71.51.8nc?Svct1 (Slc23a1)1421912_atnc1.7ncncApical vitamin C uptake [102]Svct2 (Slc23a2)1445589_at1.4ncncncBasolateral vitamin C uptake [102]Cyp2c291417651_atnc3.2ncncPhase I metabolismCyp2c651429994_s_at2.62.32.51.7Phase I metabolismCyp2d221419039_at1.71.5ncncPhase I metabolismAkr1b81448894_at13.43.25.1nc?Akr1c121422000_at-1.5ncncncAldo-ketoreductase activity (Phase II)Akr1c131418672_at-1.7ncncncAldo-ketoreductase activity (Phase II)Ephx11422438_at1.71.61.9ncEpoxide hydrolase activity (Phase II)Ephx21448499_a_at1.51.4ncncEpoxide hydrolase activity (Phase II)Gsta1///Gsta21421041_s_atnc1.21.3ncGlutathione transferase activity (phase II)Gsta31423436_atncnc1.8ncGlutathione transferase activity (phase II)Gsta41416368_atncnc1.5ncGlutathione transferase activity (phase II)Gstk11452823_at1.31.31.5ncGlutathione transferase activity (phase II)Gstm11448330_atnc1.7ncncGlutathione transferase activity (phase II)Gstm31427473_atnc2.42.6ncGlutathione transferase activity (phase II)Gstm41424835_at2.01.81.8ncGlutathione transferase activity (phase II)Gstm51416842_at-1.3ncncncGlutathione transferase activity (phase II)Gstm61422072_a_atnc1.3ncncGlutathione transferase activity (phase II)Gstt21417883_at1.2ncncncGlutathione transferase activity (phase II)Mgst11415897_a_at1.41.31.2ncGlutathione transferase activity (phase II)Abcg21422906_at1.9nc1.3ncApical heme secretion [74] Overview of PPARα-dependently regulated processes related to transport and phase I/II metabolism in the small intestine. All processes are described in the results and discussion section. FC = fold change, nc = not changed.Role of PPARα in intestinal fatty acid oxidation It is well established that PPARα serves as a master regulator of fatty acid catabolism, which is also apparent from our data [22,40]. Various transporters and phase I enzymes involved in fatty acid uptake and oxidation were PPARα-dependently regulated (Table 3). Although the extent varied somewhat, all 4 agonists regulated long chain fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation, ω-oxidation, and the metabolism of energy-yielding substrates (glycogenolysis and Krebs cycle). For most genes this regulation was agonist-independent and is consistent with earlier findings [41-43]. It is known that enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation is correlated with reduced severity of inflammatory bowel disease [44]. Furthermore it has been shown that WY14643 treatment caused a reduction of colon injury in a murine DNBS experimental colitis model [45] and that WY14643 treatment might have an anti-inflammatory effect in the small intestine [22]. It has been reported that the expression of Octn2 (Slc22a5), involved in apical carnitine uptake, is induced by WY14643 and clofibrate [46-48]. Here we showed that also EPA and DHA induced expression of Octn2. Recently it has been reported that two functionally relevant polymorphisms in the Octn2 (Slc22a5) gene are associated with increased risk for inflammatory bowel disease [49,50], and that Octn2 expression is decreased in rats with induced inflammatory bowel disease [51]. Taken together, our data imply that nutritional activation of PPARα might be therapeutically valuable for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.PPARα regulates intestinal cholesterol flux Expression of the apical cholesterol uptake transporter Npc1l1 was PPARα-dependently suppressed after treatment with WY14643, EPA, and DHA (Table 3), as also has been observed after fenofibrate treatment [52] and PPARδ activation [53]. It is known that treatment with WY14643 for 5 days induced expression of Abca1 [54]. Here we show that Abca1 is also acutely regulated after PPARα activation. Abca1, which promotes cholesterol efflux at the basolateral membrane to Apo-AI for HDL formation [55-58] was increased after treatment with WY14643 and EPA. Functionally these results suggest that less cholesterol is absorbed from the lumen and more cholesterol is transferred to Apo-A1, resulting in reduced intracellular cholesterol levels in enterocytes. Enterocytes likely compensate for this by increasing the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, as has been reported before [59-61].PPARα regulates intestinal nutrient transport and metabolism Expression of the apical glucose uptake transporter Sglt1 (Slc5a1) and the basolateral glucose efflux transporter Glut2 (Slc2a2) was PPARα-dependently repressed after WY14643 treatment. Furthermore, WY14643, EPA, and DHA all reduced expression of the apical mannose and glucose uptake transporter Sglt4 (Slc5a9), suggesting that PPARα activation results in reduced glucose transport through the intestinal wall. In addition, several transporters involved in the amino acid metabolism were PPARα-dependently regulated (Table 3). Gene expression of small intestinal apical uptake as well as basolateral efflux amino acid transporters was PPARα-dependently suppressed. Furthermore, activation of PPARα reduced expression of Slc25a12 (Aralar1), which is involved in the malate-aspartate shuttle [62]. These effects are in line with data that showed PPARα-mediated downregulation of genes involved in hepatic amino acid metabolism [40,63]. For liver it is suggested that amino acids are conserved for local synthetic processes, including protein and purine synthesis during for instance proliferation [64]. In the small intestine villus length is increased after WY14643 treatment [22], which implies that also in the small intestine amino acids are conserved for local anabolic processes. Taken together, our results suggest that PPARα activation leads to a diminished (neutral) amino acid flux through the enterocyte.PPARα regulates intestinal motility Expression of the serotonin transporter Slc6a4 (Sert) was decreased after treatment with WY14643, EPA, and DHA (Table 3). Serotonin is a neurotransmitter secreted by enterochromaffin cells and is considered to play a key role in functioning of the gut, initiating peristaltic reflex pathways and facilitating propulsive activity [65]. Inactivation of serotonin is crucial to limit its activity, and this is mediated by Sert [66]. The observed reduced expression will result in a diminished activity of Sert, which in turn may increase intestinal motility [66]. Serotonin is detoxified by sulfation inside the enterocyte [67]. The apical sulfate import seems to be reduced as gene expression of the uptake transporter Slc13a1 (Nas1) was decreased. This might be a response to the decreased uptake of serotonin. We also showed that the dopamine transporter Dat1 was PPARα-dependently upregulated after EPA and OA treatment (Table 4). Dopamine increases contractile force of intestinal motility [68], thus more dopamine likely results in increased intestinal motility. Altogether, we believe it is likely that PPARα is involved in regulating intestinal motility. Our data suggest that in feeding conditions PPARα activation may result in speeding-up intestinal motility.PPARα diminishes effects of oxidative stress Oxidative stress results from an imbalance between formation and degradation of pro-oxidants or decreased cellular antioxidant protection mechanisms and may result in increased cell damage and apoptosis [69]. Many genes included in our barrier gene set, such as CypP450s, Gsts, and several Slc transporters, are involved in oxidative stress and were PPARα-dependently regulated. CypP450s induce oxidative stress by oxidative, peroxidative, and reductive metabolism of endogenous compounds and drugs [5], whereas Gsts are involved in the defense against oxidative stress by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous electrophilic compounds [70]. Various CypP450 genes were PPARα-dependently upregulated (Table 4), which is in line with data obtained from liver [40]. However, since not all CypP450 genes are expressed in both organs, the regulated genes were not identical. Many Gsts were upregulated by activation with WY14643, EPA, and DHA (Table 3). In addition, various Slc transporters involved in oxidative stress defense were PPARα-dependently upregulated; Dic (Slc25a10), involved in the pyruvate-malate shuttle, citrate-pyruvate shuttle, and gluconeogenesis from pyruvate, is known to protect against oxidative stress [62]; Svct2 (Slc23a2), a basolaterally-located uptake transporter for ascorbic acid [71]; Mct13 (Slc16a13), proposed to play an important role in communicating information on the redox state between cells [72]; Abcg2 (Bcrp1), a secretion transporter of heme and porphyrins located in the apical membrane [73,74]; and Kmcp1 (Slc25a30), probably involved in protection from oxidative damage in situations of increased mitochondrial metabolism [75]. Taken together, we show that many barrier genes involved in defense against oxidative stress were PPARα-dependently upregulated. These data point towards an important role of PPARα in the defense against oxidative stress. In general oxidative stress results in increased cell damage and apoptosis [69] and our data might explain one of the mechanisms by which WY14643 suppresses many genes involved in apoptosis in the small intestine [22].Longitudinal distribution of the transcriptional regulation during PPARα activation is not the same for PPARα-dependently regulated genes Finally we investigated the expression along the proximal-distal axis of PPARα and 4 genes that were PPARα-dependently regulated by all agonists (Figures 2 and 3). Expression was measured with qRT-PCR. For this analysis, the small intestine was divided in 10 equal parts; part 1 represents the proximal side, whereas part 10 represents the most distal end. Expression of PPARα was maximal in duodenum and jejunum, and then gradually declined in ileum, both under basal conditions and after acute activation with WY14643 (Figure 2). For all treatments only the expression pattern in treated wild-type and PPARα-null mice of the 4 genes is reported (Figure 3). Fatp4, Abcd3, Cyp2c65, and Cyp4f16 are all involved in fatty acid metabolism; Fatp4 mediates the apical uptake of long chain fatty acids [76], whereas Abcd3 is involved in the peroxisomal β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids [77]. The human homolog of Cyp2c65 (CYP2C8) metabolizes arachidonic acid and generates epoxygenase products [78]. The rat homolog of Cyp4F16 (Cyp4F5) is involved in ω-oxidation of prostaglandins [79].Figure 2 Expression of PPARα along the longitudinal axis of control and WY14643-treated wild-type mice. QPCR was used to determine the relative expression levels of PPARα in sections isolated along the proximal-distal axis of the small intestine of wild-type mice that received the control diet (white, open bars), or were acutely treated (6 hr) with WY14643 (black, closed bars) (n = 4 per group). Small intestines were divided into 10 equal parts; part 1 refers to the most proximal part (duodenum), part 10 refers to the most distal (terminal ileum). Messenger RNA levels were standardized to cyclophilin; part 1 of the non-treated mice was arbitrarily set to 1. Significance of control versus treated wild-type mice was determined per segment using an unpaired student's t-test. * p-value < 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± standard error.Figure 3 Expression of PPARα-dependently regulated genes along the longitudinal axis of treated PPARα-null and wild-type mice. QPCR was used to determine relative expression levels of PPARα-dependently regulated genes in sections isolated along the proximal-distal axis of the small intestine from PPARα-null mice (white, open bars) and wild-type mice (black, closed bars) that were acutely treated (6 hr) with the 4 agonists (n = 4 per group). The small intestine was divided into 10 equal parts; part 1 refers to the most proximal part (duodenum), part 10 refers to the most distal (terminal ileum). Messenger RNA levels were standardized to cyclophilin; part 1 of the PPARα-null mice was arbitrarily set to 1. White bars represent the PPARα-null mice, black bars represent the wild-type mice. Significance of treated WT versus treated KO mice was determined per segment using an unpaired student's t-test. * p-value < 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± standard error. A) fatty acid transport protein 4 (Fatp4). B) ATP-binding cassette, sub-family D, member 3 (Abcd3; ALD). C) cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily c, polypeptide 65 (Cyp2c65). D) cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily f, polypeptide 16 (Cyp4f16). In EPA-, DHA- and WY14643-treated mice we observed a similar expression pattern of Fatp4 (Figure 3A), which closely resembled that of PPARα under control and WY14643-activated conditions. In contrast, OA-treated wild-type mice did not show this pattern. In all treatments no significant PPARα-dependent induction of Fatp4 was observed in the distal part of the small intestine. Abcd3 was uniformly induced by all treatments (Figure 3B). Activation with WY14643 revealed a robust, equal induction in all segments in wild-type compared to PPARα-null mice, whereas these were less for the three natural agonists. Cyp2c65 was predominantly expressed in the proximal part of the small intestine, and showed high similarity between agonists (Figure 3C). For each agonist we observed an induction of its expression which was equal along the complete longitudinal axis. Cyp4F16 was uniformly expressed along the proximal-distal axis in treated PPARα-null mice (Figure 3D). However, treatment of wild-type mice with WY14643 and OA shifted the expression of Cyp4F16 to more distal regions, whereas EPA and DHA treatment resulted in significant increased expression in more proximal segments. Taken together, the data in Figure 3 show that in general all agonists provoke a similar effect on expression of 4 PPARα-dependently regulated genes, and this induction also occurs in more distally-located cells. The latter demonstrates that despite its relatively low expression, PPARα is still able to regulate gene expression.Conclusion In the current study we have identified intestinal barrier genes that were PPARα-dependently regulated after acute activation by fatty acids. The functional outcomes inferred from our data suggest that nutritional-activated PPARα controls processes ranging from fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol-, glucose-, and amino acid-transport and metabolism to intestinal motility and oxidative stress. Altogether, we showed that PPARα has a great impact in controlling the barrier function of the gut, and this underscores the importance of PPARα for nutrient-mediated gene regulation in intestine.MethodsAnimals and materials Pure bred wild-type (129S1/SvImJ) and Pparα-null (129S4/SvJae) mice [80] were bred and housed as described [81]. All animal studies were approved by the Local Committee for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The synthetic triacylglycerols trieicosapentaenoin and tridocosahexaenoin were bought from Nu-Chek-Prep, Inc (Elysian, MN), whereas triolein was from Fluka (Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands). These are synthetic triacylglycerols with three identical acyl moieties, namely eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and oleic acid (OA), which are released as free fatty acids upon digestion in the small intestinal lumen. All three fatty acids have been reported to bind PPARα with varying affinities in the micromolar range [30-33]. WY14643 was obtained from Chemsyn (Lenexa, KS).Experimental design and tissue handling Four months-old male wild-type and PPARα-null mice were used in this study (n = 4–5 per group). Two weeks before the start of the experiment all mice were put on a background diet, which was a modified AIN76A diet (Research diet services, Wijk bij Duurstede, The Netherlands). The AIN76A diet contains 5% w/w corn oil (~10 energy%) [82], which is a relatively low amount of fat. In the current study we replaced the corn oil by the same amount of olive oil (predominantly consisting of oleic acid), since Ren et al [83] demonstrated that an olive oil-rich diet did not regulate established PPARα target genes. The modified AIN76A diet was thus assumed to be a 'poor PPARα-activating' diet, and therefore we hypothesized the number of genes PPARα-dependently regulated by OA would be nominal. However, since the amount of OA in the diet was lower than the amount dosed by gavage (see below), some genes were expected to be regulated. At the day of the experiment mice were fasted for four hours. At 9 AM mice were dosed by oral gavage with 400 μl of the synthetic triacylglycerols triolein, trieicosapentaenoin, or tridocosahexaenoin, or 400 μl of a 0.1% WY14643 suspension in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands). The volume of all doses (400 μl) equalled the maximum recommended volume for gastric gavages for mice [84]. For the fatty acids these doses corresponded to approximately 12.5 g/kg body weight. To put this amount into perspective, data on food intake (not shown) revealed that the mice consumed approximately 4 gram of the modified AIN76A diet per day, which corresponds to approximately 200 mg (6.7 g/kg body weight) of fat. The amount of WY14643 the mice received (approximately 130 mg/kg body weight) was based on previously published short-term study [85]. Six hours after the gavage the mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of isofluorane (1.5%), nitrous oxide (70%) and oxygen (30%). Small intestines were isolated and flushed with ice-cold phosphate-buffer saline and subsequent tissue handlings were performed on ice. Remaining fat and pancreatic tissue was carefully removed from the intestines. For RNA analyses of total tissue, we used full-length small intestine (microarray analyses), or sections obtained after dividing the small intestine into 10 equal parts (studying gene expression distribution along the proximal-distal axis). All small intestinal samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until RNA isolation.RNA isolation, Affymetrix GeneChip oligoarray hybridization and scanning, and quantitative real-time PCR RNA isolation, Affymetrix GeneChip oligoarray hybridization and scanning, and quantitative real-time PCR were performed as described previously [81]. The sequences of primers used in qRT-PCR are available on request. For microarray analyses, RNA was isolated from the full-length small intestine. RNA was hybridized on an Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array. This array detects 45,038 transcripts that represent 16,579 known genes. For each experimental group, four or five biological replicates were hybridized for wild-type and PPARα-null mice, and in total 35 arrays were used. Array data have been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus, accession number GSE9533.Analyses of microarray data Microarrays were analyzed as described previously [81]. To compile a list of transport and phase I/II metabolism (barrier) genes represented on the array, annotation information from Affymetrix (release of July 2006) was queried for SLC transporters, ABC transporters, CypP450s, the phase II metabolism enzymes glutathione S-transferases, sulfotransferases, epoxide hydrolases, aldo-keto reductases, N-acetyltransferases, and glucuronosyl transferases. Also glutathione reductase, glutathione synthetase, and glutathione peroxidases were included in this set. The final set consisted of 944 probesets, encoding for 529 unique genes. To study significantly expressed genes, only probesets with an expression estimate higher than 32 in either of the 8 experimental groups were selected for further analysis. This cut-off value was based qPCR experiments, because regulation of genes with an expression estimate >32 on the array could all be confirmed by qPCR [81]. The filtering was done after normalization and data analysis. Probesets that had a Bayesian comparison p-value <0.01 were considered to be significantly regulated; no cut-off value of the fold change was used. Of these, probesets that were changed in treated wild-type mice compared to treated PPARα-null mice, were designated PPARα-dependently regulated. QPCR data confirming our array analysis is presented in Table 2 and additional data, Table 7. Differences on the number of regulated genes between gene sets were tested for significance by a one-tailed binominal test. Interpretations of functional outcomes focused on groups of genes that are known to be functionally related (i.e. having a similar function or participating in the same pathway).Authors' contributions MM and GH conceived the study and supervised its design and coordination.

In addition, the effects of various combinations of these four agents were examined on non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell-lines, and on the expressions of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) on these cells. At the clinically achievable concentration of 1 µM, only 4-HPR inhibited the growths of H1299 and H460 cells-lines. However, retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ) expression was up-regulated on H460 and H1299 cells treated with 1 µM of ATRA, 13- RA, or 9- RA. All NSCLC cell lines showed growth inhibition when exposed sequentially to 1 µM ATRA and 0.1 µM 4-HPR. In particular, sequential treatment with 1 µM ATRA or 13- RA and 4-HPR markedly inhibited H1703 cell growth; these cells exhibited no basal RARβ expression and were refractory to 4-HPR. However, in NSCLC cell lines that expressed RARβ, the expressional levels of RARβ were up-regulated by ATRA alone and by sequential treatment with ATRA and 4-HPR. 4-HPR was found to be the most active of the four agents in terms of NSCLC growth-inhibition. Moreover, sequential treatments with ATRA or 13- RA followed by 4-HPR were found to have synergistic growth-inhibitory effects and to regulate RAR expression.

INTRODUCTION The retinoids, a group of vitamin A derivatives, have been identified as potential cancer treatments and have been reported to exert anti-cancer effects, which include the apoptosis and differentiation of cancer cells (1, 2). The major metabolic forms of vitamin A in vivo are retinol, retinal, and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The 9-cis retinoic acid (RA) and 13-cis RA are natural ATRA isomers, whereas 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide (4-HPR) is a conformationally restricted synthetic retinoid (3, 4). It has been established that ATRA inhibits the proliferation and induces markers of apoptosis and squamous differentiation in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines (5). A phase II study of ATRA as a single agent in NSCLC showed minimal activity (8% response rate in 28 patients) and mild toxicities (6). Moreover, although 13-cis RA is the best-studied chemopreventive retinoid in the aerodigestive tract (7), 13-cis RA treatment did not reduce the overall rates of second primary tumor development, recurrence, or mortality in stage I NSCLC (8). 9-cis RA is a naturally occurring ligand that exhibits a high degree of affinity for retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and also binds to retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (9). 9-cis RA has been observed to have a chemopreventive effect in an A/J mouse lung carcinogenesis model, and this was accompanied by retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ) upregulation (10). Kurie et al. assessed the efficacies of two retinoid-based regimens, 9-cis RA and 13-β RA+α-tocopherol, in former smokers, since the loss of RARβ expression in bronchial epithelium is considered to be a biomarker of preneoplasia, and 9-cis RA has been reported to increase RARβ expression (11). 4-HPR (Fenretinide) is a synthetic retinoid which inhibits the growths on a large number of lung cancer cell lines, including cell lines unresponsive to ATRA (12). However, no comparative study has been conducted to determine which retinoid is most effective at causing the growth inhibition of NSCLC cells. 4-HPR acts mainly via retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ), and in part via RARβ (13). On the other hand, ATRA, 13-cis RA, and 9-cis RA are compatible with all RARs/RXRs subtypes (14). The major difference between 4-HPR and the other RA derivatives is the ability to induce apoptosis; however, it does not induce cell differentiation (12). 4-HPR has been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of epithelial and hematologic malignancies, but the mechanism involved has yet to be clearly elucidated (15, 16). Two possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain 4-HPR-induced apoptosis. The first involves the participation of retinoid receptors in 4HPR-induced cellular events. This suggestion is supported by the observations that 4-HPR-induces RARβ expression in various human carcinoma cell lines (13), and that 4-HPR induces the activations of retinoic acid receptor α (RARα), RARβ, and RXRs (4). The second mechanism involves the interruption of mitochondrial membrane potentials associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 4-HPR (17). Moreover, 4-HPR appears to be more robust than ATRA with regard to its apoptosis-inducing abilities in NSCLC cells (18). However, the possible clinical use of 4-HPR raises questions concerning the need for long-term treatment and the safe and effective dosage required for the long-term inhibition of cancer cell growth. Thus, novel treatment methods are required with improved clinical efficacies. In the present study, we assessed the growth inhibitory effects of the four RA derivatives, 9-cis RA, 13-cis RA, 4-HPR, and ATRA, when treated singly, sequentially, and simultaneously and compared these treatments with regard to RARβ mRNA expressional induction in NSCLC cell lines. The other objective of this study was to determine whether 4-HPR induces apoptosis by enhancing ROS production or by upregulating retinoid receptor expression. Thus, we conjectured, if 4-HPR induces apoptosis primarily via ROS generation, other retinoids, which act as antioxidants, may exhibit an antagonistic effect when combined with 4-HPR. On the other hand, if 4-HPR acts on RARs, combinations of 4-HPR and other retinoids might result in synergism. In this study, we show that sequential treatments with ATRA or 13-cis RA and 4-HPR can synergistically inhibit NSCLC cell growth via RAR regulation. From the clinical point of view, although in vitro studies have demonstrated that 4-HPR (at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 µM) suppresses the growths of malignant cells of various histotypes, including NSCLC, the mean serum level of 4-HPR in patients receiving 200 mg daily was only 0.26 µM (19). Even though a higher plasma peak level of 4-HPR could be achieved at higher dosages, plasma peak concentrations of <3 µM appear to be safe (19). Thus, we also examined whether sequential treatments incorporating therapeutic doses of retinoids and low concentrations of 4-HPR synergistically cause growth inhibitory effects in lung cancer cells, and whether these occur via RAR or RXR pathways.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and culture The NSCLC H460, H1299, H1703, and A549 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, U.S.A.). H1299, H1703, and H460 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), whereas A549 cells were cultured in F12 supplemented with 10% FBS. All cell lines were grown at 37℃ in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded at 5×105 cells/10-cm plate in 10% FBS-containing medium, but at 70% confluence were incubated for 24 hr in 0.5% FBS-containing medium, in order to minimize the effects of endogenous RA in culture medium. They were then treated with retinoids for 48 hr, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4), and collected by trypsinization.Reagents and treatments ATRA, 13-cis RA, 9-cis RA, and 4-HPR were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.), dissolved in 100% DMSO at 100 mM or 10 mM (4-HPR), and stored in the dark at -80℃. We treated cell lines with these agents to evaluate interactions between 4-HPR and the other retinoids in the following ways: protocol 1 (0.1 µM 4-HPR alone), protocol 2 (1 µM ATRA alone), protocol 3 (0.1 µM 4-HPR for 1 hr followed by 1 µM of ATRA), protocol 4 (1 µM ATRA for 1 hr followed by 0.1 µM of 4-HPR), and protocol 5 (simultaneous treatment with 0.1 µM 4-HPR plus 1 µM ATRA). 13-cis RA or 9-cis RA were examined in the same manner as ATRA.MTT assays Cellular growth rates were determined using MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays. Cells were grown in 96-well plates in 0.5% FBS-containing medium at an initial density of 5×103 cells/well. After 24 hr, wells were treated with various concentrations of retinoid. After 24, 48 or 72 hr, 50 µL of MTT solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) was added, and plates were incubated at 37℃ for 4 hr. Media and treated solutions were then aspirated, and the formazan formed was solubilized with 150 µL DMSO. Cell viabilities were measured as recommended by the manufacturer, and individual well absorbances were measured at 540 nm using a microplate reader (BioRad, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.).RT-PCR Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells treated with or without various concentrations and combinations of retinoids, using TriReagent-RNA isolation reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, U.S.A.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two-microgram aliquots of total RNA were used to generate cDNAs using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV; Gibco/BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, U.S.A.) and Oligo-d (T)15 primer (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, U.S.A.) in a final volume of 20 µL. Reaction mixtures consisted of 5x first strand buffer (Gibco/BRL), 0.1 M DTT, 2.5 mM each dNTP, 2.5 units/µL MMLV, and 2.5 µM Oligo-d(T)15 primer. The cDNA products (1 µL) obtained were then subjected to PCR to amplify RARβ2 and β-actin. The sense and antisense primers used for RARβ2 were 5'-CAT GTT TGA CTG TAT GGA TG-3' and 5'-AGC CCT TAC ATC CCT CAC AG-3', respectively, which produced a 329-bp PCR product, and those for β-actin (the internal control) were 5'-ACC CAG ATC ATG TTT GAG ACC-3' and 5'-GGA GTT GAA GGT AGT TTC GTG-3', respectively, and produced a 486-bp PCR product. The PCR reaction mixture (50 µL) consisted of 1× reaction buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 200 µM dNTP, 0.4 units Han-Taq polymerase (Genenmed, Seoul, Korea) and 0.2 µM of each primer. An initial denaturation at 94℃ for 5 min was followed by 35 amplification cycles of 94℃ for 30 sec, 50℃ for 30 sec, and 72℃ for 1 min and a final extension step at 72℃ for 10 min. The PCR products obtained from each sample were then electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed.Median effect analysis Median effect analysis, using the Hill equation, was used to determine synergistic, additive, and antagonistic effects, when up to three agents were combined (20). H1703 cells were incubated for 1 hr with different concentrations of ATRA or 13-cis RA (at 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 µM), and then incubated for 48 or 72 hr with 4-HPR (0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 µM). The effects of sequential treatment with ATRA or 13-cis RA and 4-HPR were determined using a dose-effect analysis software (Biosoft, Cambridge, England). CI values indicated synergism (CI<1), an additive effect (CI=1), or antagonism (CI>1).Northern blot analysis Total sample cellular RNAs (10 µg) were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel, transferred overnight to GeneScreen Plus® nylon membranes (NEN®Life Science Products, Inc., Boston, MA, U.S.A.) by the capillary transfer method, and then immobilized on membranes by UV crosslinking. RNA blots were prehybridized and then hybridized to [α-32P]-dCTP-labeled RAR cDNA probes, which were kindly donated by Dr. Jonathan M. Kurie and Dr. Ronald Evans (the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas and the Salk Institute, San Diego, CA) (19-21). After incubation overnight, membranes were washed under high-stringency conditions (0.1X SSC at 65℃) and exposed overnight (below -70℃) to radiography film for autoradiography. Membranes were also stripped and reprobed with GAPDH cDNA, which was used as an RNA loading control. Quantitative analyses were performed with a Multi-Image light cabinet, and quantified using a Gel-doc Image analyzer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.).RESULTSGrowth inhibitory effects of retinoids on NSCLC cell lines To compare the efficiencies of the retinoids, H460, H1299, H1703, or A549 cells were treated with increasing concentrations (0.1-10 µM) of retinoids for 24, 48, or 72 hr, and then MTT assayed. Growth inhibition was defined when treated cells had viabilities <70% of those of untreated cells. Weak or no growth inhibition was observed after treating either A549 or H1703 with low or high concentrations (0.1 or 1 µM, respectively) of 4-HPR (Table 1). In contrast, H1299 cell growth was inhibited by 4-HPR at both of these concentrations, whereas H460 cell growth was inhibited by 4-HPR at 1 µM only. At the clinically achievable concentration of 1 µM, no growth inhibition was observed by treatment of 9-cis RA, 13-cis RA, or ATRA in any of the four NSCLC cell-lines. Although the treatment with 9-cis, 13-cis RA, or ATRA at 10 µM inhibited cell growths by 30-84%, this concentration is difficult to achieve in human serum due to intolerable toxicity or rapid drug metabolism.Expression patterns of RARβ in response to retinoids In order to determine whether retinoid treatment restores RARβ expression, RARβ mRNA levels in NSCLC cells treated with retinoids were assessed by RT-PCR. Since the pharmacologically achievable concentration of retinoids is 1 µM, this concentration was used for each retinoid. Although no growth inhibitory effect was observed after adding ATRA, 13-cis RA, or 9-cis RA at 1 µM, it was found that RARβ expression was up regulated in H460 and in H1299 cells treated with ATRA, 13-cis RA, or 9-cis RA at 1 µM (Fig. 1). Moreover, A549 cells revealed RARβ expression induction after treatment with 1 µM ATRA or 1 µM 9-cis RA, whereas 1 µM 13-cis RA failed to increase RARβ expression in these cells. H1299 cells and H460 cells, which showed growth inhibition after being treated with 1 µM 4-HPR, also showed RARβ expressional induction post-treatment (Table 1). Moreover, A549 cells, which were refractory to 1 µM 4-HPR treatment, showed brief RARβ expressional induction at 24 hr post-treatment. However, in 4-HPR refractory H1703 cells, which showed no basal RARβ expression, RARβ was not induced by 1 µM 4-HPR or by the other retinoids at this concentration. These results indicate that 1 µM 4-HPR may induce growth inhibition and induce RARβ expression in RARβ-positive NSCLC cells.Growth inhibitory effects of combinations of 4-HPR and other retinoids in NSCLC cell lines To investigate the growth inhibitory effects of combinational (sequential and simultaneous) treatments with 4-HPR and other retinoids, each of the NSCLC cell lines was treated using the sequential and simultaneous protocols described in 'Materials and Methods'. All NSCLC cell lines showed growth inhibition when exposed to 1 µM ATRA followed by 0.1 µM 4-HPR (Fig. 2A). In particular, sequential treatment with ATRA or 13-cis RA and 4-HPR (ATRA or 13-cis RA 1 µM for 1 hr followed by 4-HPR 0.1 µM for 48 hr) markedly inhibited the growth of H1703 cells, which exhibited no basal RARβ expression and were refractory to 4-HPR treatment. These results imply that the growth inhibitory effects of 4-HPR can be facilitated by pretreating first with other retinoids that regulate the expressions of RARs or RXRs.Synergistic effects of sequential ATRA or 13-cis RA and 4-HPR in H1703 cells In order to confirm the synergistic effects of sequential ATRA or 13-cis RA and 4-HPR, combination index (CI) plots were drawn. Table 2 and 3 depict fractions affected (Fa) and CI values. Plots of CI versus Fa are shown for sequential 13-cis RA or ATRA in combination with 4-HPR (ATRA or 13-cis RA 1 µM for 1 hr followed by 4-HPR 0.1 µM for 48 hr or 72 hr) in H1703 cells (Fig. 3). ATRA or 13-cis RA for 1 hr followed by 4-HPR, especially for 72 hr of 4-HPR treatment showed consistent synergism with various combinations of ATRA or 13-cis RA with CI values of <1, indicating synergism.RARs and RXRs expressions after treatment with combinations of 4-HPR and retinoids (ATRA, 13-cis RA, or 9-cis RA) in NSCLC cell lines In order to determine whether combinational treatments of 4-HPR and other retinoids enhance RAR or RXR expressions, northern blot analyses were performed (Fig. 4); results were compared with those obtained for single treatments. ATRA 1 µM treatment induced RARα expression in all NCSLC cell lines and induced RARβ in three cell lines (except H1703). In the other NSCLC cell lines, which showed basal RARβ expression, RARβ expressional levels were up regulated by 1 µM ATRA alone or by sequentially treating with 1 µM ATRA and 0.1 µM 4-HPR (Fig. 4B). In contrast, RARγ expression was induced by 1 µM ATRA in all NSCLC cell lines, but these inductions of RARγ were lost by simultaneously or sequentially treating ATRA and 4-HPR in all four NSCLC cell lines (Fig. 4C). Basal RARβ-positive NSCLC cell lines revealed RARγ expressional induction after 0.1 µM 4-HPR treatment, whereas H1703 cells, which did not exhibit RARβ basal expression, showed reduced RARγ expression after treatment with 0.1 µM 4-HPR. The synergistic growth inhibition shown by H1703 cells sequentially treated with ATRA 1 µM for 1 hr followed by 4-HPR 0.1 µM for 48 hr was accompanied by reduced RARγ expression. Moreover, this sequential treatment with 4-HPR prevented the upregulation of RARγ by ATRA. These findings indicate that sequential treatment with other retinoids and 4-HPR may cause growth inhibition due to the modulation of RAR expressions by the initially treated retinoids.DISCUSSION The retinoids are a class of natural and synthetic vitamin A analogues, and some retinoids are known to play major roles in cell growth regulation and in the differentiation of normal, benign, and malignant cell types. Retinoids are among the most intensively studied cancer chemoprevention agents. However, the broad biological activities of the retinoids lead to a number of undesirable side effects, which limits their long-term clinical usefulnesses as chemopreventatives (21). 13-cis RA was found to be effective at reversing upper aerodigestive tract premalignancies (22) and at preventing second primary tumor development in advanced head and neck cancer (23), but its administration was also associated with significant toxicity. In terms of lung cancer treatment, the United States Intergroup Study found no benefit for 13-cis RA intervention in individuals with a prior history of lung cancer (8). In the present study, no growth inhibitory effects were observed on therapeutic (1 µM) dosages of ATRA or 13-cis RA, although RARβ expression was found to be up-regulated in NSCLC cell lines after ATRA or 13-cis RA treatment. 9-cis RA, a natural ATRA isomer, is a pan-agonist that is able to bind to and activate both RXRs and RARs. 9-cis RA can activate RXR/RAR heterodimers, RXR/RXR homodimers, and other nuclear receptor complexes in which RXR is a ligand-binding partner, such as, vitamin D receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (24). Thus, by virtue of its unique receptor-binding properties, 9-cis RA exerts biological effects that differ from those of ATRA or 13-cis RA. In a recent study, 9-cis RA was found to up regulate RARβ expression in bronchial squamous metaplasia (11), which suggests that 9-cis RA is a potential chemopreventive agent in NSCLC. However, in the present study, 9-cis RA inhibited NSCLC cell growth only at higher than clinically acceptable concentrations. 4-HPR, despite its inability to bind directly to nuclear receptors, shows some preventive activity in experimental animals, and was also found to be active in lung cancer cell lines, where it inhibited growth and induced apoptosis. However, 4-HPR does not induce cell differentiation as in RAs, but rather induces apoptosis (12, 25, 26), which is not effectively induced by RAs. ROS production, the RAR/RXR pathway, and a variety of mechanisms yet to be elucidated can mediate 4-HPR-induced apoptosis. Moreover, several previous reports have indicated that 4-HPR is far more potent than ATRA in terms of inducing NSCLC cell apoptosis, thus indicating the need for further preventative and therapeutic trials (18). Although in vitro studies have demonstrated that 4-HPR (at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 µM) suppresses the growth of NSCLC cells, and that these effects are associated with apoptotic induction, 4-HPR was not effective at reversing squamous metaplasia, dysplasia, or genetic and phenotypic abnormalities in the bronchial epithelium of smokers (27). This inactivity of 4-HPR with respect to pathologic changes in bronchial mucosa raised the possibility that serum 4-HPR levels in this previous study were too low to achieve a biological effect. The apoptotic effects of 4-HPR in tissue cultures typically require 4-HPR concentrations of >1 µM (18). A phase I trial of 4-HPR in children with neuroblastoma demonstrated that high-dose 4-HPR was well tolerated up to 4,000 mg/m2/day (19). The highest dose examined in this trial produced an average drug plasma level of 12.9 µM, and an association was found between plasma peak levels and toxicity-associated side effects. After repeated treatments, plasma peak concentrations of <3 µM appeared to be safe. Moreover, the frequency of grade 2-3 toxicity was found to be significantly higher in patients with peak levels exceeding 3 µM (19). In the present study, the growth inhibitory effect of 4-HPR in NSCLC cell lines was interesting, because, although no growth inhibitory effects were observed in A549 or H1703 cells with 0.1 µM treatment, 4-HPR inhibited the growths of all four NSCLC cell lines tested at the clinically relevant concentration of 1 µM, and in fact, H1299 cells were even inhibited at 0.1 µM. Recently, ROS generation has been implicated in 4-HPR-induced apoptosis in some malignant cells (28). Low doses of ROS, particularly of hydrogen peroxide, are known to be mitogenic and to promote cell proliferation, whereas high levels of oxidative stress ultimately cause cell death via apoptotic or necrotic mechanisms (29). Thus, if 4-HPR induces apoptosis primarily by inducing ROS production, 4-HPR could have antagonistic effects when co-administered with ATRA, 13-cis RA, or 9-cis RA, as these species are antioxidants (14). Conversely, if 4-HPR mainly acts on RAR, combinations of 4-HPR and other retinoids may act synergistically. 4-HPR binds to retinol-binding protein in the liver, and therefore competes with retinol and reduces serum retinol levels (30). Thus, loss of serum retinol may counterbalance the chemopreventive effects of 4-HPR, and the effect of 4-HPR might be enhanced by restoring normal retinol levels by administering 4-HPR in combination with other retinoids (27). The growth inhibitory effects of retinoid treatments in all NSCLC cells examined were greater when the cells were exposed to 1 µM ATRA followed by 0.1 µM 4-HPR. H1703 cells, which do not show RARβ basal expression, were not sensitive to 4-HPR treatment alone. However, sequential treatment with ATRA or 13-cis RA followed by 4-HPR synergistically inhibited H1703 cell growth. Moreover, these growth inhibitions were accompanied by reduced RARγ expression on H1703 cells, when the cells were treated with 4-HPR alone or with sequential ATRA or 13-cis RA and 4-HPR. RARγ expression also was lower in cells treated with sequential ATRA/4-HPR than in cells treated with ATRA alone in all NSCLC cell lines. Since these cells showed RARγ up regulation after a single ATRA treatment, 4-HPR appears to act in concert with the up regulated RARγ expression induced by ATRA but to override the effect of ATRA when they are administered sequentially. The ATRA/4-HPR combination has been examined in other cancer cells. Lim et al. investigated whether 4-HPR (due to its suppression of HER2/neu and/or EGFR expression) sensitized breast cancer cells to ATRA, and found that at a concentration of 1.3 µM, 4-HPR increased ATRA sensitivity in a synergistic manner in BT-474, MDA-MB-453, and MCF-7/HER2 breast cancer cells (31). Another study demonstrated the efficacy of 4-HPR in mice bearing the human ovarian carcinoma IGROV-1, and demonstrated that 4-HPR significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of cisplatin. In IGROV-1 tumor-bearing mice, a simultaneous RA/4-HPR combination was found to significantly improve the efficacy of 4-HPR, and resulted in an antitumor activity similar to that of cisplatin alone. These findings demonstrate that the simultaneous RA/4-HPR combination may increase the antitumor activity of 4-HPR (32). We conclude that sequential ATRA or 13-cis RA and 4-HPR treatments offer a valid therapeutic approach to the treatment or chemoprevention of NSCLC via RAR expressional modulation. Moreover, this approach could overcome 4-HPR refractoriness in NSCLC cells. Further work is warranted to determine the identities of the molecular signals underlying the synergistic and additive effects of RAs.

It is a common disorder in elderly subjects and represents a major public health problem, affecting up to 40% postmenopausal women and 15% of men. Among the several therapeutical interventions, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was traditionally seen as the gold standard for preventing osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women, as well as for the management of menopausal symptoms. However HRT, especially if administered long-term, may lead to an increased risk of breast and, when unopposed by progestins, endometrial cancers. Alternative therapies include bisphosphonates and raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). While the former have been associated with suboptimal adherence, the latter was considerably less potent than estrogen and its effect in the prevention of nonvertebral fractures remain uncertain. The purpose of this article is to review the clinical trials of lasofoxifene, a new SERM for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The medical literature was reviewed for appropriate articles containing the terms “lasofoxifene” and SERMs”. There are three (phase II or phase III) clinical trials that clearly demonstrate efficacy and safety of this new SERM in the suppression of bone loss and the prevention of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. Moreover, lasofoxifene treatment also reduced breast cancer risk and the occurrence of vaginal atrophy. With its increased potency and efficacy on the prevention of nonvertebral fractures lasofoxifene may be an alternative and cost-effective therapy for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

If a similar cost will be established, lasofoxifene treatment could have improved cost-effectiveness compared with raloxifene.Scope, aims, and objectives Lasofoxifene is a new generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has completed the phase III development program for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. This compound has a remarkably improved oral bioavailability with respect to other SERMs due to increased resistance to intestinal wall glucuronidation. In both preclinical and short-term phase II clinical studies lasofoxifene showed a favorable safety profile and demonstrated a proven efficacy in preventing bone loss and lowering cholesterol levels. The recent results from phase III clinical trials demonstrated the clinical efficacy of this drug in the prevention of fractures and the reduction of breast cancer risk. The purpose of this article is to review the clinical evidence for the use of lasofoxifene in women after menopause and to discuss how it will fit into the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.Methods Relevant articles were identified on the basis of searches in PubMed and EMBASE databases using the terms “lasofoxifene”, “CP-336156”, and “selective estrogen receptor modulators”. The search was updated on September 30, 2008. One hundred and seventy-eight articles were found, of which 11 were written in languages other than English and were excluded (Table 1). Within those publications, one report from a phase II clinical trial and 67 review articles were identified. Of the 67 review articles, three provided systematic review of multiple randomized controlled trials and were considered. The phase II clinical study was a two-year comparative trial of the skeletal effects of lasofoxifene and raloxifene in postmenopausal women. Twenty-five further abstracts were identified from the annual meetings of the Endocrine Society and the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), of which eight were considered relevant. These abstracts presented the results from three large, phase III, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials with bone mineral density (BMD) or fractures as a primary end-point: the Osteoporosis Prevention and Lipid Lowering (OPAL) parallel studies, and the Postmenopausal Evaluation and Risk-Reduction With Lasofoxifene (PEARL) study. Each study provided level 2 evidence on the efficacy and safety of lasofoxifene for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In addition, two clinical documents about lasofoxifene were available on the Internet, concerning the risk benefit profile of lasofoxifene presented for the 2008 FDA application: the “Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee Briefing Document” and the “Background Document for Meeting of Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs”. These documents provided additional and detailed evidence on the efficacy and safety of lasofoxifene treatment in postmenopausal women. No pharmacoeconomic reports of lasofoxifene were identified.Disease overview Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength and increased risk of fracture.1 It is one of the most common disorders in elderly subjects and represents a major public health problem, affecting up to 40% postmenopausal women and 15% of men.2 Worldwide, osteoporosis is estimated to be present in over 200 million individuals, with 75 million of these in Europe, Japan and the US.3 Its clinical significance lies in the occurrence of fractures, involving most commonly the forearm, the vertebral bodies and the hip, but fractures at other sites may be also associated with the disease. Each year in the United States more than 1.5 million people suffer hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures due to osteoporosis.4 In the European Community, in the year 2000, the number of osteoporotic fractures was estimated at 3.79 million.3 The occurrence of osteoporotic fractures leads to considerable mortality, morbidity, reduced mobility and decreased quality of life.5 Moreover, future risk of osteoporotic fractures is greatly increased in patients with one or more vertebral fractures.6 In 1999, the annual number of hip fractures in 15 countries of the EC has been estimated to be 500,000, with a total care cost of about 4.8 billion euros per year.7 In the US, in 2002 the combined annual costs of all osteoporotic fractures have been estimated to be US$20 billion.8 This burden will further increase in absolute terms over the next years because of the aging population.9,8 Given the magnitude of the problem, the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is, therefore, of major importance for health organizations in all countries. The major determinant of bone strength and osteoporotic fracture risk is BMD, as assessed by dual photon absorptiometry or dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. According to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, osteoporosis is defined to exist when BMD values fall more than 2.5 standard deviations below the young adult reference mean.1 Many studies indicate that the risk of fragility fractures increases progressively as BMD declines.10–13 It has been estimated that the risk of new vertebral fractures increases by a factor of 2.0–2.4 for each standard deviation decrease in BMD, irrespective of the site of bone density measurement.10 However, several other skeletal characteristics contribute to bone strength and interact with BMD in determining the risk of fracture. These include bone macroarchitecture (shape and geometry), bone microarchitecture (at the trabecular and cortical level), matrix and mineral composition, as well as the rate of bone turnover and the degree of mineralization or microdamage accumulation, affecting the structural and material properties of bone.14,15 The recognition and measurement of these parameters is becoming more important, and their incorporation into algorithms of fracture detection remains the subject of active research. Osteoporosis occurs as the result of multiple mechanisms that together cause loss of bone mass and strength.16 Failure to acquire optimal bone mass and strength during growth and or an unbalance in bone remodeling leading to bone loss throughout life may all contribute to the development of the disease. In women, osteoporosis and fractures mainly occurs as a consequence of estrogen deficiency after menopause and results from an imbalance between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts, leading to a net bone loss with each remodeling cycle. A decrease in estrogen production from androgen precursors has also been supposed to be a major cause of bone loss and osteoporosis in aging men.17,18 The mechanism by which estrogen affects bone metabolism is complex and not fully elucidated. Possible mechanisms include a decrease in osteoclastogenesis, osteoclast apoptosis and additional effects on calcium homeostasis.19 Estrogen acts through the binding and activation to estrogen receptor (ER). Until recently, only one form of ER was known to exist.20,21 With the discovery of a new form of the receptor, the ERβ,22,23 encoded by a different gene, the original form has been now identified as ERα. While both the ERs bind estrogen as well as other agonists or antagonists (although with different affinities), they have distinctly different localizations and concentrations in several tissues, including bone.24 In fact, concentrations of ERβ are higher in developing cancellous bone, whereas concentrations of ERα are higher in developing cortical bone.25 Moreover, target cells for estrogen action may contain varying concentrations of homodimers of one or both ERs, as well as ERα and ERβ heterodimers. Structural functional differences also exist between ERα and ERβ, when complexed with estrogen, allowing for a wide range of diverse actions to take place.26–28 In women, the decrease in estrogen production during menopause has been associated with other nonskeletal complications involving lipid metabolism, and the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Decreasing levels of estrogen have been also associated with menopausal vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes, insomnia, nausea, and vaginal discharge or bleeding.Current therapy options and unmet needs Among the several therapeutical interventions in osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has traditionally been seen as the gold standard method of preventing osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women, as well as for the management of menopausal symptoms. Other potential benefits include the prevention of colon cancer and a neuroprotective effect.29 Despite biologically plausible mechanisms for cardiac protection by estrogen, and observational studies indicating that HRT confers cardiovascular benefit,30 the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) and other recent randomized controlled trials have failed to confirm any potential benefit in reducing the risk of coronary artery disease and stroke.31 Indeed, early increases in cardiac event and stroke rate have been seen in women taking combination HRT. Secondary analysis of the WHI trial taking into account age categories and years since menopause suggested no apparent increase in coronary hearth disease risk for women close to menopause (within 10 years of menopause and under 60 years of age), but particularly high risks in older postmenopausal women.32 Moreover, estrogen replacement, especially if administered long-term, may lead to an increased risk of breast and, when unopposed by progestins, endometrial cancers.33 Other side effects often associated with HRT are fluid retention, breast pain, headache, and resumption of menstrual cycle. These side effects may be mediated by ERs, acting on a large number of downstream signals. Thus, the use of HRT now needs to be regarded as a short-term therapy for menopausal symptom management with treatment individualized for each woman.34 In contrast, estrogen replacement must be long-term, possibly lifelong, to have any lasting impact on bone health. Alternative therapies for the prevention and the treatment of osteoporosis include bisphosphonates, calcitonin, vitamin D, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), strontium ranelate and parathyroid hormone.15 According to their mechanism of action and their prevalent effects on osteoblasts and/or osteoclasts (cells involved, respectively, in bone formation and bone resorption) all the above compounds are generally grouped into two major classes (Table 2): antiresorptive (inhibiting bone resorption) or anabolic (stimulating bone formation) agents. With this classification, antiresorptive treatments include calcium, vitamin D and its active analogs, HRT, bisphosphonates, SERMS, and calcitonin. The only available compound with a clear anabolic effect that stimulates bone formation is parathyroid hormone, either in its intact form (hPTH 1–84) or the 34 aminoacid peptide (hPTH 1–34) now called teriparatide. Strontium ranelate is considered a compound with mixed antiresorptive and anabolic activity, postulated to increase bone formation while reducing bone resorption. The bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronate) are actually the most prescribed medications for the treatment of osteoporosis. Their benefits are restricted to the skeleton where they decrease the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. Moreover, adverse events such as esophagitis or esophageal ulcers, hypocalcaemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw and, concerning zoledronate, atrial fibrillation have been described in patients on bisphosphonate treatment. Even though the incidence of most of these adverse events is limited, nonadherence to and poor persistence with bisphosphonates is common.35 Given its additional effects on different menopause-related complications, major efforts have been made to identify alternatives for HRT in post-menopausal women. In this respect, SERMs represent a class with a growing number of compounds that act as either ER agonists or antagonists in a tissue-specific manner.36,37 This pharmacological profile may offer the opportunity to dissociate favorable estrogenic effects on the bone from unfavorable stimulatory effects on the breast and endometrium. This class of compounds includes chemically diverse molecules that lack the steroid structure of estrogens, but possess a tertiary structure that allows them to bind to ERα and/or ERβ. Most of the unique pharmacology of SERMs as well as their agonistic and antagonistic activity on estrogen target tissues can be explained by three main interactive mechanisms27 differential ERα and ERβ expression, differential ER conformation on ligand binding, and differential expression and binding to the ER of coregulator proteins (coactivators or corepressors). Because of their selective estrogen-agonist properties on different target tissues, SERMs can be indicated for the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by estrogen deficiency, including osteoporosis, without most of the undesiderable effects of estrogens. In addition, due to their selective estrogen-antagonist properties in the breast, SERMs can be also used to prevent or treat breast cancer, in which estrogen-agonistic activity is undesiderable.38 Currently there are two main chemical classes of SERMs approved for clinical use: the triphenylethylene derivatives tamoxifen and toremifene that are used to treat breast cancer, and raloxifene, a benzothiopene derivative indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and in US for the prevention of breast cancer.36,37,39,40,38 All three also have beneficial effects on serum lipids, but are associated with venous thromboembolism and hot flushes. Moreover, although tamoxifen has a positive effect on bone as well, the increased risk of endometrial cancer eliminates it as a possible therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis. The effects of raloxifene on bone are well established. Clinical trials demonstrated that at a daily dose of 60 mg is effective in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and vertebral fractures.41–43 This compound also lacks estrogenic activity at the uterus but is associated with adverse effects such as blood clots and vasomotor symptoms, including hot flushes. Both preclinical and clinical reports suggest that both tamoxifen and raloxifene are considerably less potent than estrogen,44–46 in part due to their reduced bioavailability. Moreover, their effect in the prevention of hip and other nonvertebral fractures is still uncertain. The benefits of these SERMs in reducing the risks of invasive breast cancer and vertebral fracture should be weighed against the increased risks of venous thromboembolism, fatal stroke, and in case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer. A consistent number of women taking available SERMs for different indications reported moderate or severe vasomotor or gynecologic symptoms (especially vaginal dryness and hot flashes) that could hinder compliance.34 It is evident that there is a need for a SERM that has the desirable tissue-specific estrogenic and antiestrogenic actions with minimal side effects. Newer generation SERMs being investigated for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women include bazedoxifene, ospemifene, arzoxifene and lasofoxifene, which are in phase III clinical trials or undergoing regulatory review.40 Other new SERMS have had clinical trials suspended prematurely: levormeloxifene, for causing urinary incontinence and uterine prolapse, and idoxifene, for resulting in increased endometrial thickness on ultrasonography but without significant histological abnormality.Summary of pharmacology and preclinical evidenceMechanism of action, metabolism, and pharmacokinetic profile Lasofoxifene (CP-336156) is potent new generation SERM, discovered through a synthetic program aimed at isolating novel molecules with good oral bioavailability and higher potency in vivo.47–49 It is a naphthalene derivative, third generation SERM, structurally distinct from the first- and second-generation SERMs raloxifene (a benzothiopene derivative), tamoxifen and clomiphene (both triphenylethylene derivatives) or idoxifene (a pyrrolidine derivative). Lasofoxifene exerts significant estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo, targeting any tissues that possess ERs, such as bone, uterus, breast, blood vessels, and liver. Competitive binding assay experiments demonstrated high affinity of the compound for both ERα and ERβ. Like other SERMs, lasofoxifene specifically binds to human ERα even though with high affinity and with a half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) which is similar to that seen with estradiol and thus at least 10-fold higher than those reported for raloxifene, tamoxifen and droloxifene.47,50–52 Lasofoxifene also has a high affinity for the human ERβ that is similar to estradiol.47 Lasofoxifene is well absorbed orally, very highly bound to plasma proteins and almost exclusively metabolized by the liver (through both oxidative and conjugative pathways), with a long elimination half-life of approximately six days (150 hours). This slow elimination is similar to some other SERMs, such as tamoxifen (120–168 hours) and toremifene (120–144 hours), but is substantially longer than for raloxifene (16–87 hours).53 However, lasofoxifene has a remarkably improved oral bioavailability with respect to other SERM compounds due to increased resistance to intestinal wall glucuronidation. This characteristic is due to its nonpolar tetrahydronaphthalene structure, making the compound a poorer substrate for glucuronidation.47,54 Conversely, the phenolic groups of benzothiopene derivatives such as raloxifene are extensively glucuronidated in the intestinal wall, which would account for their poor oral bioavailability and their limited in vivo potency.51–53 In a comparative study in the rat, lasofoxifene and raloxifene showed bioavailabilities of 62% and 10%, respectively.47 In humans, both lasofoxifene and its metabolites are recovered primarily in the feces and secondarily in urine.55 Less than 2% of the administered dose of lasofoxifene is recovered unchanged in the urine; hence there is little effect in the pharmacokinetics of the drug in patients with impaired renal function. In different studies, lasofoxifene demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose range (from 0.01 to 100 mg).56,57 The mean time until maximum concentration (Tmax) is approximately six hours, and the estimated terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) is six days. Age, weight, race, mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment or use of concomitant medications (ie, ketaconazole, digoxin, or warfarin) have not been associated with substantial differences in lasofoxifene pharmacokinetics.58–60 Thus, no dosage adjustment of the drug should be required for these patient-specific factors.Preclinical studies with lasofoxifene The effects of lasofoxifene have been tested in different in vitro cell systems as well as in different animal models.51–53 Lasofoxifene action in both skeletal and extraskeletal tissues was evaluated. In bone cells, lasofoxifene exhibited an estrogen-like activity and, similar to estradiol, induced apoptosis of osteoclast precursors, thus decreasing bone resorption.61 Different short-term and long-term in vivo studies in ovari-ectomyzed (OVX) rats confirmed the in vitro evidence and demonstrated that lasofoxifene treatment (at doses of 10 to 1000 μg/kg/day) reduces bone turnover and is effective in protecting from OVX-induced bone loss without any major adverse finding.47,61–63 Bone histomorphometry studies of the lumbar vertebrae confirmed that the bone-protective effects of lasofoxifene were identical to those observed with estradiol, indicating that this compound is a full estrogen agonist on bone.61,63 In fact, at doses of 10–1,000 μg/kg/day lasofoxifene completely blocked the ovariectomy-induced decrease in trabecular number and thickness as well as the increase in bone resorption indices (osteoclast number, percent osteoclast perimeter, percent eroded perimeter) and bone formation indices (labeling perimeter, BFR/BV).61 Long-term studies in the same models showed that lasofoxifene maintains its efficacy on bone over time without any major adverse finding.63 Moreover, peripheral quantitative computerized tomography analysis of proximal tibial metaphysis and biomechanical testing of the fourth lumbar vertebra clearly indicated that lasofoxifene treatment maintained bone quality and preserved bone strength in treated animals.63 Interestingly, lasofoxifene was also effective in the prevention of bone loss induced by aging or orchidectomy (ORX) in male models of osteoporosis, without significant effects on the prostate,64,65 suggesting a potential application of this compound for the treatment of osteoporosis not only in postmenopausal women but also in elderly men. A higher dose (10 to 100 vs 0.01 to 0.1 μg/kg/day) was required to prevent ORX-induced than age-related decrease in bone mass. Preclinical studies demonstrated additional extraskeletal benefits of lasofoxifene on serum lipids47,61–66 as well as chemopreventive and therapeutic effects on breast cancer, comparable with those of tamoxifen.67,68 No uterine hypertrophic effects were observed at doses of 1 to 1000 μg/kg/day in OVX rats,47,63 and at doses of 0.1 to 100 μg/kg/day in immature (3-week-old) or aged (17-month-old) intact female rats.61 No toxicity was reported in the preclinical literature in either female and male rats of different ages.51–53 Importantly, at doses that efficiently prevent bone loss, lasofoxifene did not significantly affect the uterus or the prostate. Moreover, the compound did not appear to have any adverse effects on fertility in male rats.69 In female rats, lasofoxifene at different doses (0.01, 0.03, and 1 mg/kg/day) significantly affected the oestrous cycle after 7–9 days of treatment. Restoration of normal estrous cycle was achieved one to two weeks after the suspension of therapy.70 As part of an International Conference on Harmonization guideline on reproductive and developmental toxicity testing for new pharmaceuticals [http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidances5a.pdf], a pre- and post-natal study in pregnant and lactating female rats was designed.71 Lasofoxifene at oral doses of 0.01, 0.03, and 1 mg/kg decreased maternal body weight, increased dose-dependently the length of gestation and induced dystocia. Higher doses (10 or 100 mg/kg) induced teratologic effects.72 Concentrations in maternal plasma were similar to those in milk, and increased with increasing dose, remaining consistent over a 10 day period.71 Inhibition of growth of the F1 offspring after perinatal exposure to lasofoxifene was described, without any other significant effect. No effects on the F2 generation were observed. These findings were similar to those reported for raloxifene.73Clinical evidence with lasoxoxifene in osteoporosisClinical efficacy assessment in randomized trials An extensive development clinical program has been conducted with lasofoxifene, including 23 clinical pharmacology studies and 17 phase II/III clinical trials. This development program included more than 10,000 women and was designed to support the use of lasofoxifene for the prevention or treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (Table 3) and for the treatment of vulva-vaginal atrophy. Despite positive evidence about the skeletal efficacy of lasofoxifene have emerged from abstract presentations at different meetings, there is only a single phase II trial74 actually published in peer reviewed journals. Additional information has been derived from New Drug Application documents.75,76 Phase I studies demonstrated that lasofoxifene doses at 0.1 to 0.5 mg after an overnight fast are well tolerated.56,77 A pharmacodynamic investigation was performed in a randomized, placebo controlled, and multiple oral dose study in 64 fasted, female volunteers.57 Included subjects were confirmed to be menopausal, within 30% of the ideal weight and without any treatment with HRT, SERM, calcitonin, sodium fluoride, and calcium supplements within the previous three months or bisphosphonates within the previous 12 months. A loading dose of five times the daily dose was followed by lasofoxifene at doses of 0.01, 0.003, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/day or placebo, after a fast of at least eight hours for 14 days. A tendency toward decreases in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) at all doses and decreases in N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) at the higher doses (0.3 and 1.0 mg/day) was reported. This raised the hypothesis that the dosage of 0.3 mg/day is close to the maximally effective dose for bone markers. In subsequent phase II multiple dose studies early stage safety and efficacy of lasofoxifene was studied over a 600-fold dose range (from 0.017 mg/day to 10 mg/day).78,79 At all doses, the compound was well tolerated, without undue toxicity. The overall results from the dose selection analyses suggested that the lowest lasofoxifene dose necessary to achieve a fully efficacious response on BMD and LDL-C levels is 0.25 mg/day.79–81 All lasofoxifene treatment regimens were also associated with improvements in vaginal atrophy measures, namely maturation index and vaginal pH, compared with placebo. In a different phase II study lasofoxifene increased BMD as effectively as conjugate estrogen (‘Prempro’, premarin conjugated estrogen with medroxyprogesterone acetate).78,82,83 The key evidence with lasofoxifene for the treatment of osteoporosis comes from a phase II comparative trial with raloxifene and from 2 phase III trials: the Osteoporosis Prevention and Lipid Lowering (OPAL) study, and the Postmenopausal Evaluation and Risk-Reduction With Lasofoxifene (PEARL) study. All these studies assessed the disease-oriented outcomes of BMD and bone turnover markers, while only PEARL evaluated the key patient-oriented outcome of fractures. The two-year, phase II study compared the skeletal effects of lasofoxifene 0.25 mg/day (n = 82, mean age 59.0 yrs, average years since menopause: 10) and 1.0 mg/day (n = 82, mean age 57.7 yrs, average years since menopause: 9) to raloxifene (60 mg/day; n = 163, mean age 57.5 yrs, average years since menopause: 9) and placebo (n = 83, mean age 57.5 yrs, average years since menopause: 8) in 410 postmenopausal women (average T score -1.0).74,84,85 All women also received daily calcium (1000 mg) and vitamin D (250 IU) supplementation. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline to two years in lumbar spine BMD. Secondary endpoints included total hip BMD and total body bone mineral content, the change from baseline of lumbar spine at month 6 and year 1, biochemical markers of bone turnover, LDL-C, and safety profile. At the lumbar spine, both doses of lasofoxifene significantly increased BMD compared with raloxifene and with placebo treatment (+1.8 and +2.2% for 0.25 and 1.0 mg lasofoxifene, respectively; −0.1 and −1.7% for raloxifene and placebo, respectively; Figure 1a).84 Conversely, the two doses of lasofoxifene and raloxifene were equally effective at increasing total hip BMD. Consistent with the effects on BMD, biochemical markers of bone turnover (urinary N-telopeptide and deoxypyridinoline crosslinks, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin) significantly decreased after two years of lasofoxifene treatment with respect to placebo. No major differences were observed between the 0.25 mg and 1.0 mg lasofoxifene groups. Overall, the effects on bone turnover were similar or greater than those observed with raloxifene. At two years, both doses of lasofoxifene resulted in greater reductions in LDL-C and total cholesterol levels when compared with raloxifene and placebo.85 Moreover lasofoxifene-treated women showed significantly greater decreases in Apo B100 (−11.7% vs −5%) and lipoprotein(a) (−37.7% vs −25.6%) and significantly greater increase in Apo A1 (+5.5% vs 1.6%) compared with raloxifene-treated women. Lasofoxifene was also effective in reducing levels of coagulation factors (fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1], and antithrombin III activity) compared with placebo (p < 0.05). No differences in breast pain were observed with lasofoxifene compared to placebo or raloxifene. Pooled preliminary results from the OPAL studies have been only presented in abstract form.86,87 These were two identical phase III, 24-month, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in 1907 healthy postmenopausal women aged 40 to 75 years (3 to 20 years postmenopausal). Among the inclusion criteria there was a lumbar spine BMD T score between 0 and −2.5. Women were excluded if they had diseases associated with altered bone metabolism, malignancy within the previous five years, ovarian or uterine pathology, spinal deformities that would affect lumbar densitometry, hip prosthesis, or a history of nontraumatic vertebral or hip fractures. Following a six to eight week placebo run-in period, recruited subjects were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 24 months of double-blind treatment with lasofoxifene 0.025 mg/day, 0.25 mg/day, and 0.5 mg/day or placebo. All patients received calcium or vitamin D supplementation. The primary endpoint was the two-year change in lumbar spine BMD, which was evaluated using an a priori fixed sequence multiple comparisons procedure on data pooled from both studies. Lasofoxifene treatment significantly increased BMD and decreased bone turnover compared to placebo, with beneficial changes observed as early as six months.86 All three lasofoxifene doses were able to significantly increase lumbar and femoral BMD at 6, 12, and 24 months as compared with a decrease observed in calcium and vitamin D supplemented placebo group. At two years, lumbar BMD increased by 1.5%, 2.3%, and 2.3% in lasofoxifene 0.025 mg/day, 0.25 mg/day, and 0.5 mg/day treatment groups, respectively, as compared with a decrease of 0.7% with placebo (Figure 1b). A significant decrease in bone turnover markers (osteocalcin, CTX, and P1NP) was also observed at six and 24 months in lasofoxifene treatment groups with respect to placebo. Moreover, bone biopsies in lasofoxifene-treated subjects showed bone of normal quality. Changes in signs and self-assessed symptoms of vaginal atrophy or cognitive function and variations in lipid levels were also periodically analyzed over 24 months.87 Neither breast density, assessed by mammography in 351 women, nor breast pain increased in the lasofoxifene groups. There was a significant improvement in vaginal pH at 12 and 24 months for all doses of lasofoxifene versus placebo. The assessment of the degree of vaginal maturation indicated significantly lower percentages of parabasal cells and significantly higher proportions of intermediate and superficial cells at 12 and 24 months in lasofoxifene-treated women with respect to placebo. The evaluation of cognitive function and mood in a subset of patients (n = 267) did not show any difference between lasofoxifene and placebo groups, except a lower CESD-10 depression score at 12 months and a lower Digits Forward score in 0.025 mg group; neither results were judged to be clinically meaningful. At all time points lasofoxifene treatment was associated with significant reductions in LDL-C relative to placebo. LDL-C reductions were significantly greater in the 0.25 and 0.5 mg/day groups than in the 0.025 mg/day group. Similar reductions were observed in total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, apolipoprotein B100, apolipoprotein B100/apolipoprotein A1 ratio, and lipoprotein a, in all treatment groups. Relative to placebo, lasofoxifene 0.25 and 0.5 mg/day were associated with small but significant increases in tryglicerides from baseline at all time points. At 24 months, all lasofoxifene treatment groups were associated with significantly greater reductions in the prothrombotic marker fibrinogen and high sensitivity C-reactive protein compared with placebo. The PEARL trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel assignment study aimed to determine the safety and effectiveness of two doses of lasofoxifene in reducing the risk of new/worsening radiographic spinal fractures (primary endpoint) in women with osteoporosis;78 http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct]. Secondary outcomes included nonvertebral fractures, BMD, bone markers, breast cancer, cardiovascular events, and gynecological safety events. Osteoporotic postmenopausal women (n = 8556, BMD T score < −2.5 SD, age range 59–80 yrs) were included in the study if they had no other metabolic bone disease, if they were not taking medications approved for osteoporosis, if they have had no recent fracture (within one year), no more than three prevalent vertebral fractures on baseline X-ray and/or a BMD <–4.5 SD at the lumbar spine or the femoral neck. The study was originally designed as a three-year study, but was extended by two additional years via a protocol amendment in order to provide long-term exposure data. Results have been recently released in abstract form,88–90 as well as in two additional documents [http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets], but have not yet been published in peer-reviewed papers. At three years, lasofoxifene significantly reduced bone turnover markers and improved BMD at the spine (3.3% for both doses; p < 0.001) and femoral neck (2.7% for 0.25 mg and 3.3% for 0.5 mg; p < 0.001), compared with placebo. A significant reduction in vertebral fracture risk was demonstrated with both treatment arms (31% for 0.25 mg; p = 0.002 and 42% for 0.5 mg; p < 0.001) (Figure 2). This effect was observed as early as one year for both doses of lasofoxifene and was sustained through five years. A similar risk reduction was observed with both doses in women with or without prevalent fracture at baseline. The risk of non-vertebral fractures at three years was significantly reduced by 22% (p = 0.02) in the lasofoxifene 0.5 mg group and was maintained through five years (Figure 3). Consistent with the data on vertebral fractures, the significant effect of lasofoxifene 0.5 mg on nonvertebral fractures was observed as early as one year. Conversely, lasofoxifene 0.25 mg did not significantly reduce nonvertebral fracture risk at any time point. Of interest, lasofoxifene 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg also reduced the risk of ER-positive breast cancer (by 84% and 67%, respectively) and of all breast cancers (Figure 4). This effect was maintained (79% reduction of all breast cancers) after five years with lasofoxifene 0.5 mg. Efficacy of lasofoxifene treatment on vulvar and vaginal atrophy endpoints (symptoms, vaginal pH and maturation index, percentage of parabasal cells and of superficial cells) was also demonstrated with both lasofoxifene doses.Safety and tolerability In all clinical trials performed to date, lasofoxifene appeared to be well tolerated.56,77,78,87 In general, adverse events were mild or moderate and usually resolved within a few days, without treatment discontinuation. Moreover, there were no changes in adverse event frequency or intensity with increasing dose. In a comparative phase II study, the adverse event profile of lasofoxifene was similar to that of raloxifene with respect to increases in hot flashes and leg cramps compared with placebo.84 These appear to be class effects of SERMs.91 An increased frequency of urogenital symptoms (mainly increased vaginal moisture, considered to be beneficial by some women) were observed in lasofoxifene-treated groups compared with the raloxifene-treated group.84 This is consistent with preclinical observations showing that lasofoxifene stimulates vaginal mucus formation without causing cell proliferation in the rat reproductive tract.92 Vasodilatation was an additional adverse event attributed to lasofoxifene treatment in another one-year study on healthy postmeno-pausal women.80 In phase III studies adverse events reported by more than 5% of lasofoxifene treated subjects included hot flashes, leg cramps and increased vaginal moisture.87,90 Major general safety events of special interest for any SERM have been comprehensively addressed in phase III clinical trials, as secondary endpoints. There were two safety findings of note associated with lasofoxifene treatment: an increased incidence of uterine diagnostic procedures and an increase in venous thromboembolic events. Even though the larger clinical safety database from the PEARL trial does not show evidence of an increased risk of endometrial cancer or hyperplasia associated with the use of lasofoxifene for five years, gynecologic adverse events occurred more frequently than placebo;90 http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct]. These included uterine polyps and endometrial hypertrophy, both considered benign findings, as well as an increased reporting of uterine prolapse. The latter was not confirmed by comprehensive and specific rating scales used to evaluate pelvic organ prolapse, nor was there a significant increase in prolapse surgery through five years of follow-up in the PEARL trial. Benign effects on the endometrium were characterized by an approximate 1.5 mm mean increase in endometrial thickness and increased cystic echotexture on ultrasound, which are consistent with benign cystic atrophy on biopsy. These effects have been attributed to increased vascular permeability by lasofoxifene, which results in uterine imbibition and accumulation of fluid in both the glands and stroma of the endometrium, consistent with the cystic echotexture and increased endometrial thickness observed on ultrasound, together with the benign cystic atrophy observed on biopsy. In the PEARL study, vaginal bleeding was reported with low frequency, but was more common in lasofoxifene-treated patients compared to placebo. This small increase in vaginal bleeding, together with asymptomatic benign endometrial findings detected in unplanned trans-vaginal ultrasound, contributed to the observed increase in diagnostic uterine procedures. During the five years follow up of the PEARL study, lasofoxifene was associated with an approximate twofold increased risk of venous thromboembolism, mainly driven by an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis.90 In fact, pulmonary embolism occurred less frequently than deep vein thrombosis (0.2% vs 0.8%, respectively) but was also significantly increased in lasofoxifene-treated patients compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 4.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97–20.79 for lasofoxifene 0.5 mg and HR 5.98, 95% CI: 1.33–26.72 for lasofoxifene 0.25 mg). Conversely, lasofoxifene was not associated with an increased risk of stroke. Indeed, while the prospectively-defined analysis included transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), an analysis excluding TIAs showed lasofoxifene to be associated with a decreased risk of stroke. Consistent with preclinical data, both three- and five-year data from the PEARL study clearly showed that lasofoxifene treatment is associated with a reduction in risk of breast cancer (this was a co-primary endpoint in the PEARL study at five years). This effect was evident with lasofoxifene 0.5 mg for all breast cancers, ER+, invasive, and ER+ invasive breast cancers which was not consistently observed with lasofoxifene 0.25 mg [http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct]. Importantly, lasofoxifene 0.5 mg was associated with a significant 32% reduction in major coronary events (including coronary death, nonfatal myocardial infarctions, coronary revascularization procedures, documented new ischemic heart disease, and hospitalizations for unstable angina) through five years [http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct]. Markers of cardiovascular risk (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein) were measured at three years and showed a significant reduction in lasofoxifene-treated subjects compared to placebo.Economic evidence Pharmacoeconomic evaluation on the use of lasofoxifene in osteoporosis prevention or treatment has been not released. Moreover, although several articles addressed the economic value of specific agents, the cost-effectiveness of all currently available drugs approved for the treatment of osteoporosis has not been reported. Antiresorptive agents are considered effective in reducing fracture incidence and generally have favorable cost-effectiveness profiles for most postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.93,94 Recent results from the US further support the treatment of high risk postmenopausal populations because of the gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and, in women aged 75 years with previous fracture, overall cost savings because of the reduction in health care services.95 The WHO recently developed a clinical tool for calculation of the 10-year probability of fracture, that can be used in combination with country specific data (ie, fracture rates, health care costs) to develop cost-effective intervention thresholds for osteoporosis treatment. Using US-specific data, the cost-effectiveness for treatment is reached when the 10-year probability of hip fracture using the WHO algorithm is approximately 3% or above.96 To date, few studies have considered the favorable extraskeletal effects of SERMs or the impact of drug side effects on the cost-effectiveness of treatment. In this context, it is important to differentiate between the quality of life impact caused by the antifracture efficacy of an intervention and any general quality of life impact that it may have independently of that antifracture efficacy. In a UK meta-analysis considering postmenopausal women unselected for low BMD and modeled for additional conditions such as breast cancer and cardiovascular health, only raloxifene proved cost-effective for the prevention of vertebral fractures at 60 years of age, with a cost per QALY of £26,000 (assuming no impact on hip fractures) that was below the estimated threshold of £35,000 corresponding to no treatment (with the assumption that all women had sufficient intakes of calcium and vitamin D).97 Bisphosphonates such as alendronate, etidronate, and risedronate had a cost per QALY above that threshold. Moreover, none of the considered interventions was shown to cost-effectively reduce the risk of nonvertebral fractures in women unselected for low BMD. These net costs were markedly different by age, with some treatment regimens becoming cost-saving at higher age-ranges in patients with a prior fracture. Long-term phase II studies and the recent results from the PEARL phase III trial show that lasofoxifene has an improved profile in bone parameters (ie, markers of bone resorption and BMD) with significant improvement in fracture prevention (particularly in nonvertebral fractures) over the current leading SERM, raloxifene. This new SERM also retains a similar positive effect in breast cancer prevention to raloxifene, with potentially improved cardiovascular benefits. Thus if lasofoxifene will be marketed at a similar cost to current products its cost-effectiveness should be improved with respect to raloxifene.Patient group/population Preliminary evidence from randomized phase III clinical trials, released in abstract form, has shown vertebral and nonvertebral fracture risk reduction with lasofoxifene 0.5 mg/day in postmenopausal women with postmeno-pausal osteoporosis with or without a previous fracture. Potential additive beneficial effects of treatment include vaginal atrophy, breast cancer prevention and heart disease. Confirmation of such positive results in these areas would make the drug very attractive to patients at risk for those conditions and postmenopausal bone loss, vastly extending the drug’s patient potential. Some concerns on the overall risk/benefit profile of lasofoxifene are related to the slight increase in the number of deaths observed at five years in the PEARL study in subjects treated with lasofoxifene 0.25 mg/day versus placebo (90 vs 65, respectively). Moreover, because treatment with lasofoxifene, similar to other SERM compounds, is associated with hot flushes, deep venous thromboses, pulmonary embolism, and leg cramps, patients taking this SERM should be informed of these adverse events. Potential increased risk of vaginal bleeding, mainly due to uterine polyps, should be also reported in the lasofoxifene drug product label.Dosage, administration, and formulations According to the recent NDA application (22–242), and based on the improved clinical efficacy on bone and extraskeletal endpoints of lasofoxifene 0.5 mg versus 0.25 mg, the compound will be supplied as 0.5 mg, film-coated tablets (lasofoxifene tartrate 0.5 mg; Fablyn®, Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc./Pfizer Inc.) for daily oral administration. Initial pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that food does not significantly affect the bioavailability of single doses of lasofoxifene relative to the fasting state.77 Therefore the drug can be dosed without regard to the timing of meals.Place in therapy for lasofoxifene in osteoporosis During the past 10 years, several efforts have been devoted to the understanding of ER system and the development of compounds that interact with intracellular ERs in target organs as estrogen agonist and antagonists. The search for a SERM molecule with an ideal pharmacologic profile, which has estrogen-like activity on the bone and the lipid profile, antiestrogenic activity on the breast and neutral activity on the uterus, represented for many years the goal to be achieved by pharmaceutical companies. This need has been further emphasized by the recent negative results from WHI and other randomized controlled trials on HRT,31 particularly for long-term treatment regimens in late postmenopausal women.32 Thus far, a very versatile group of SERMs have been developed, with potentially different indications and different compounds are actually under investigation. However, although currently available SERMs possess many benefits, they are also responsible for some very serious side effects, such as thromboembolic disorders and uterine cancer. These contraindications represent a major concern for the type of long-term, chronic therapy that is required to prevent osteoporosis. Moreover, a consistent proportion of women taking available SERMs for different indications reported moderate or severe vasomotor or gynecologic symptoms (especially vaginal dryness and hot flashes) that could hinder compliance. These side effects have been also reported for most of the new SERMs under development, including arzoxifene, droloxifene and idoxifene, as well as for raloxifene, the only SERM compound actually approved worldwide for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Moreover, both preclinical and clinical reports suggest that these SERMs are considerably less potent than estrogen, probably due to their reduced bioavailability.44–46 In this context, lasofoxifene appears to be a promising new SERM for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Due to increased resistance to intestinal wall glucuronidation, this compound has shown a remarkably improved oral bioavailability and increased in vitro and in vivo potency with respect to other SERMs. Moreover, lasofoxifene shows a beneficial pharmacologic profile on bone, breast, and serum lipids, without any major adverse effects on the uterus. In fact, even though there was an increased percentage of patients reporting endometrial polyps and vaginal bleeding leading to more gynecologic procedures during lasofoxifene treatment, there is no evidence of increase endometrial carcinoma or endometrial hyperplasia in the lasofoxifene treated-women compared to placebo. Interestingly, the chemopreventive and therapeutic effects of lasofoxifene on animal models of breast cancer appear higher than those of raloxifene, and comparable with those of tamoxifen. Potential additional benefits that lasofoxifene may have over raloxifene include its beneficial estrogen-like effects on urogenital atrophy. This latter issue has been recently addressed in planned interim analysis from a placebo-controlled trial on postmenopausal women78 and might represent an important benefit since about 40% of women, potential users of SERMs, report vaginal dryness and other complications associated with urogenital atrophy (ie, vaginal discharge and infections, recurrent urinary tract infections, and dyspareunia). In 2004, following the positive results of phase II/III studies on postmenopausal women, Pfizer decided to submit two new drug applications (NDA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for lasofoxifene 0.25 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (NDA 21–757) and for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with low bone mass (NDA 21–843). In not-approvable letters issued in 2005 for osteoporosis prevention and 2006 for treatment of vaginal atrophy, the FDA acknowledged that efficacy had been demonstrated for both indications, but stated concerns regarding a hypothetical risk of endometrial cancer and an increased risk of invasive gynecological procedures. Based on the positive results of the long term (three years), phase III, fracture trial PEARL and of the two-year extension on safety concerns, a new application (NDA 22–242) has been recently submitted to request approval of Fabyln® (lasofoxifene tartrate, 0.5 mg tablets) for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. Due to the reporting out of PEARL at five years, the lasofoxifene safety database at the time of this NDA submission for the treatment of osteoporosis was about seven times larger than that provided in the previously submitted NDAs. The available results from PEARL demonstrate that lasofoxifene 0.5 mg significantly reduced the risk of new/worsening radiographic vertebral fracture, the risk of nonvertebral fracture, and the risk of clinical fracture in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Significant risk reduction for these parameters was seen as early as one year and was sustained through five years of treatment. Overall, these results on skeletal outcomes are consistent with preclinical or preliminary phase II comparative observations74 and indicate an improved efficacy of lasofoxifene over raloxifene. Additionally, lasofoxifene 0.5 mg seemed to exert comparable clinical efficacy in reducing the risk of breast cancer (ER+, all, ER+ invasive, and invasive) than raloxifene, with a risk reduction that was equivalent to that observed in the MORE and CORE trials.98,99 Moreover, the recent enlargement of the safety database with the inclusion of five-year results from the extension of the PEARL trial has allowed a more robust assessment of the benefit-risk profile of lasofoxifene for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and has enabled Pfizer to address the specific concerns on gynecological safety previously raised by the FDA. Despite a twofold greater number of women within each lasofoxifene group (0.25 and 0.5 mg) that underwent one or more uterine procedures than in placebo group, there was no evidence of a clinically significant increase in the incidence of uterine cancer or endometrial hyperplasia over the five years of treatment. An increased number of patients with vaginal bleeding, along with increased endometrial thickness and increased endometrial polyps, appeared as the major causes leading to more gynecologic procedures in lasofoxifene treated subjects. Even though of less clinical significance than endometrial cancer, these adverse events might impact the overall risk–benefit profile of the compound. Other additional concerns of lasofoxifene treatment are the increased percentage of subjects with venous thromboembolic events (largely due to deep vein thrombosis) and a slightly increased percentage of all-cause mortality on both the three- and five-year safety data compared with placebo. Unexpectedly, the percentage of subjects who died in the 0.25 mg lasofoxifene group exceeded that in the 0.5 mg group and was statistically greater than that in the placebo-treated subjects based on five-year data. The excess numbers of deaths were found primarily in the noncoronary vascular and cancer categories. The latter did not appear to be focused in any specific organ system. Slightly more cancer deaths occurred in the brain, lung, and gastrointestinal system in the lasofoxifene-treated subjects. The impact of these findings on the overall risk/benefit profile of lasofoxifene for the proposed indication remains unclear and needs further investigation. In addition to the improved efficiency on the prevention of vertebral fractures and to the significant effect on the prevention of nonvertebral fractures (that was not demonstrated with raloxifene) additional benefits of lasofoxifene over currently available SERMs are the beneficial effects on urogenital atrophy and the cardiovascular system. Confirmation of such positive results in these areas would make the drug very attractive to patients at-risk for those conditions and postmenopausal bone loss, vastly extending the drug’s patient potential. No information at all is available addressing the pharmacoeconomic aspects of a treatment with lasofoxifene. In conclusion, consistent with the encouraging preclinical evidence, the recently presented results from PEARL trial indicate that lasofoxifene may represent a valid alternative to HRT or raloxifene in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Specific studies on different outcomes (ie, the prevention of breast cancer or coronary events in high-risk populations) and longer term analysis in larger samples concerning clinically relevant adverse events will be needed to obtain a reasonable view of the future and cost-effectiveness of this compound in the management of women’s health following menopause.

Previously, plant studies have shown that PAHs induce oxidative stress, reduce growth, and cause leaf deformation as well as tissue necrosis. To understand the transcriptional changes that occur during these processes, we performed microarray experiments on L. under phenanthrene treatment, and compared the results to published Arabidopsis microarray data representing a variety of stress and hormone treatments. In addition, to probe hormonal aspects of PAH stress, we assayed transgenic ethylene-inducible reporter plants as well as ethylene pathway mutants under phenanthrene treatment. Microarray results revealed numerous perturbations in signaling and metabolic pathways that regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and responses related to pathogen defense. A number of glutathione S-transferases that may tag xenobiotics for transport to the vacuole were upregulated. Comparative microarray analyses indicated that the phenanthrene response was closely related to other ROS conditions, including pathogen defense conditions. The ethylene-inducible transgenic reporters were activated by phenanthrene. Mutant experiments showed that PAH inhibits growth through an ethylene-independent pathway, as PAH-treated ethylene-insensitive mutants exhibited a greater growth reduction than WT. Further, phenanthrene-treated, constitutive ethylene signaling mutants had longer roots than the untreated control plants, indicating that the PAH inhibits parts of the ethylene signaling pathway. This study identified major physiological systems that participate in the PAH-induced stress response in Arabidopsis. At the transcriptional level, the results identify specific gene targets that will be valuable in finding lead compounds and engineering increased tolerance. Collectively, the results open a number of new avenues for researching and improving plant resilience and PAH phytoremediation.

At the transcriptional level, the results identify specific gene targets that will be valuable in finding lead compounds and engineering increased tolerance. Collectively, the results open a number of new avenues for researching and improving plant resilience and PAH phytoremediation. Background Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are a family of persistent, hydrophobic environmental toxins that originate from the incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels as well as from the release of petroleum into the environment [1,2]. As PAHs are potent carcinogens in humans [3,4], remediation of PAH contamination is an ongoing endeavor. Traditionally, removal of pollutants from soil is a disruptive and costly physical process; consequently, there is strong interest in applying phytoremediation, the use of plants to sequester, volatilize, or degrade pollutants [5,6]. An idealized plant used for PAH removal would uptake large amounts of the pollutant into the root system, transport the molecules to cellular compartments, metabolize the pollutant, and utilize or volatilize the nontoxic byproducts. In practice, these processes are rate- or capacity-limited, thereby limiting the net removal of PAH from soil. Over time, stress from pollutants and their byproducts can cause cumulative plant damage, further reducing pollutant flux through the system. With the goals of identifying and relaxing these constraints, theoretical and applied research is ongoing. As an example of enhanced arsenic phytoremediation, a series of experiments identified limiting processes and introduced transgenic constructs into Arabidopsis, resulting in greatly increased uptake and tolerance of the pollutant [7-9]. Unlike in arsenic phytoremediation, where plant hyperaccumulation followed by harvesting is the goal, phytoremediation of PAHs could ultimately lead to complete degradation of the organic compounds. Following PAH treatment, plants exhibit a variety of stresses. Previous studies have shown that PAHs cause trichome and leaf deformations, accumulation of H2O2, oxidative stress, cell death, upregulation of antioxidant systems, and reduced plant growth [1,10-14]. In many regards, these symptoms broadly resemble the pathogenic hypersensitive response (HR) [14]. While there is substantial evidence of oxidative stress, the signaling and biochemical changes leading to the complex PAH symptoms are unknown. The phytohormone ethylene has long been known to play central roles in oxidative stress responses and cell death [15], in plant growth inhibition [16], and in abiotic as well as pathogen responses [17,18]. These broad parallels, as well as the observation that the ethylene-responsive gene GSTF2 is upregulated in PAH-treated Arabidopsis [14,19], suggest that ethylene signaling may play a role in the PAH stress response. To better understand these areas, this study performed DNA microarray experiments to measure global transcriptional changes in Arabidopsis when treated with the three-ringed PAH phenanthrene. In addition, possible roles of ethylene signaling were investigated using ethylene-responsive reporter plants, ethylene production mutants, ethylene signaling mutants, and exogenous application of an ethylene precursor.ResultsTranscriptional responses to phenanthrene To assess differential transcript levels of PAH-treated Arabidopsis, microarray experiments were performed on wild type (WT) whole plants grown for 21 days on sterile medium containing 0 mM or 0.25 mM phenanthrene. The PAH treatment level is comparable to levels found in polluted land and water sites [10]. A statistically significant set of transcripts was selected using a Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. Of these, high-stringency biological relevance was defined as the genes with greater than two-fold change in either direction, resulting in 1031 phenanthrene-responsive transcripts that were analyzed further. The full microarray dataset is available in Additional File 1, and the differentially-expressed subset is available in Additional File 2. To elucidate classes of transcripts affected by phenanthrene, gene ontology (GO) analyses were performed on the 1031 differentially-expressed genes. A summary of this analysis is available in Additional File 3. Complementing the GO analysis, MapMan figures (Additional File 4) were produced to visualize phenanthrene-induced changes in cellular processes. Additional File 5 highlights relevant transcriptional changes related to stress, hormone signaling, and other selected processes. A striking feature is the downregulation of photosynthesis-related mRNA levels (Additional File 3, Additional File 4a,b). In concert with the reduced photosynthesis, chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis as well as protein targeting to the chloroplasts were reduced (Additional File 3, Additional File 4c,d). Downregulated processes further included protein biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis (Additional File 3). Of the differentially-expressed transcripts, there is a strong overrepresentation of genes involved in biotic and abiotic stresses, oxidative stress, wounding, immunity, and defense responses (Additional File 3, Additional File 4e). For instance, the genes coding for the ethylene-inducible defense response proteins PDF1.2a and PDF1.2b [20] were strongly upregulated on the microarray (Additional File 5). The pathogenesis related (PR) gene PR-1, which is the marker gene for systemic acquired resistance (SAR) was upregulated over 200-fold. PR-1 is induced by salicylic acid (SA) but does not require ethylene or jasmonate [21]. Transcript levels of PR-2, -3 (B-CHI, basic chitinase), -4, and -5 were also increased by phenanthrene (Additional File 1, Additional File 5, and Additional File 6). A variety of antioxidant and detoxification systems were affected (Additional File 3 and Additional File 4f). The transcript level of the arginine decarboxylase ADC2, a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis, was increased on the PAH microarray (Additional File 2). Twelve microarray probes representing glutathione transferases (GST), enzymes that tag xenobiotics with glutathione for transport into the vacuole [22,23], reported significant increases (Additional File 2 and Additional File 5). For instance, the GST AtGSTU24 was upregulated on phenanthrene. Additionally, the microarray probe that recognized AtGSTF2 (At4g02520) and AtGSTF3 (At2g02930) indicated a 3.7-fold increase of the transcripts on phenanthrene. Similarly, the probe that binds the GSTs At1g02920 and At1g02930 indicated 12-fold upregulation of these genes. Among the phenanthrene responsive GSTs, AtGSTU24 has previously been shown to be sharply and rapidly induced by the herbicides acetochlor and metolachlor, as well as the explosives 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine [24]. Along similar lines, UDP-glucoronosyl and UDP-glucosyl transferase UGT74F2 (At2g43820, Additional File 5) was strongly upregulated by phenanthrene. This gene was constitutively upregulated in antioxidant loss-of-function mutants [25], which is consistent with upregulation in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activation of the secretory system is further indicated by upregulation of protein targeting through the ER and the Golgi apparatus (Additional File 4d). Inversely, mRNA levels of several antioxidant genes were diminished (Additional File 4e). Downregulated mRNAs include the catalases (Additional File 1) CAT1, CAT3, as well as CAT2 which is consistent with previous RT-PCR data [10]. The ascorbate peroxidases APX4 (Additional File 5) and TAPX (Additional File 2) as well as the superoxide-dismutase FSD1 (Additional File 5) were also downregulated on phenanthrene. Expression levels of many hormone-responsive genes were changed: Generally, jasmonic acid (JA), SA, or abscisic acid responsive genes were induced, whereas gibberellic acid, brassinolide or auxin responsive genes were repressed (Additional File 3, Additional File 4f, Additional File 5). Expression of many typical ethylene-inducible genes was induced, including defensins, HEL, GSTs and basic chitinase (Additional File 5). However, other typical ethylene-responsive genes, such as HLS1, were unaffected. Two genes of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway were downregulated: ACS6, an aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase, and ACO2, an 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase. Of the 145 putative ethylene-regulated AP2/EREBP transcription factor genes [26], 126 are represented on the microarray (Additional File 1), and mRNA levels of ten of these were more than two-fold affected by phenanthrene. Interestingly, the ethylene response factor ERF1-1, which integrates ethylene and JA signals [27], was significantly upregulated in the PAH dataset (Additional File 1). An overview of the transcriptional changes in hormonal and other regulatory processes is given in Additional File 3 and Additional File 4f.Comparison between phenanthrene and other stress and hormone treatments The gene ontology and MapMan analyses (Additional File 3 and Additional File 4e) of the transcriptional profile indicate that the PAH response shares commonality with biotic stress responses. Illustrating this relationship, Figure 1 compares the phenanthrene dataset to the treatment with the pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea, and indicates a strong correlation (ρ = 0.72) between the two treatments. In Figure 1, Quadrants I and III contain the transcripts that were jointly up- or downregulated on both treatments. The vast majority of the phenanthrene responsive transcripts fall into these categories. For instance, the cell wall expansins AtEXP1, AtEXP8 [14], and AtEXP11 were downregulated on both treatments (Quadrant III). Quadrant II contains transcripts that were downregulated by phenanthrene but upregulated by the B. cinerea fungal attack, and includes the ethylene biosynthesis gene ACS6. Inversely, Quadrant IV contains transcripts that are highly expressed on phenanthrene and diminished by the pathogen, including the cell wall expansin AtEXP4, AtNAP2 (POP1), which encodes a NAP-type ABC transporter, and At1g47400 of unknown function.Figure 1 Comparison of transcriptional responses to phenanthrene and Botrytis cinerea. Scatter plot of 1031 differentially-expressed transcripts from microarray data of 21-day old phenanthrene-treated Arabidopsis plants, compared to B. cinerea treatment. Counts represent the number of transcripts up (+) or down (-) regulated in each condition. Roman numerals identify the quadrants described in the text. To further compare the PAH response with other experimental conditions, the phenanthrene dataset was clustered with a variety of published microarray datasets measuring responses to biotic, abiotic, chemical, and physical stresses as well as hormone and hormone inhibitor treatments. Table 1 shows correlations between the phenanthrene microarray and other experimental conditions. The heatmap in Figure 2 shows the results from clustering genes and experimental conditions. The complete dataset of the heatmap is available in Additional File 6. The manifest clusters in the heatmap show strong similarity with various strains of Pseudomonas syringae, as well as the fungi B. cinerea and Erysiphe orontii. Ozone, osmotic, and oxidative stresses, as well as senescence, also correlated with the phenanthrene response.Table 1 Transcriptional correlations between phenanthrene and other treatments.CodeTreatmentCorrelationNASCPHEPhenanthrene (3 w, 3 w)1.00botBotrytis cinerea (4 w, 48 h)0.72167pstP. syringae patovar tomato (5 w, 24 h)0.71330o3Ozone (2 w, 6 h)0.6726avrP. syringae avrRpm1 (5 w, 24 h)0.66120phaP. syringae phaseolicola (5 w, 24 h)0.64120ossOsmotic stress (2 w, 24 h; shoot)0.64139ps1P. syringae DC3000 (5 w, 24 h)0.63120senNone; senescence (mid flowering; leaves)0.6252pviP. syringae ES4326 (4 w, 48 h)0.60168saSalicylic acid (1 w, 3 h)0.55192eoiErysiphe orontii (5 w, 5 d)0.52169oxsOxidative stress (2 w, 24 h; shoot)0.51139ag3AgNO3 (1 w, 3 h)0.48188gtsGenotoxicity (2 w, 24 h; shoot)0.46142uvsUV radiation (2 w, 24 h; shoot)0.42144tib2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA; 1 w, 3 h)0.36186pavP. syringae ES4326 avrRpt2 (4 w, 48 h)0.32168iaaIndoleacetic acid (IAA; 1 w, 3 h)0.27175mjaMethyl jasmonate (1 w, 3 h)0.26174ga3Gibberellic aid (1 w, 3 h)0.20177abaAbscisic acid (1 w, 3 h)0.19176ctkCytokinin (3 w, 3 h)0.18181acc1-aminocycloprop. 1-carbox. acid (1 w, 3 h)0.18172pacPaclobutrazol (1 w, 12 h)-0.01185avgAminoethoxyvinylglycine (1 w, 3 h)-0.01188braBrassinolide (1 w, 3 h)-0.03178cssCaesium-137 (shoot; 3 w, 2 w)-0.07324 Correlations between microarray profiles of 1031 phenanthrene-responsive genes under phenanthrene treatment and 27 other stress and hormone treatments.

Hierarchical clusterings of genes and experiments, created from phenanthrene and published Arabidopsis microarray datasets. Values in the Color Key are log2(treated/control) microarray intensity values. Experiment codes are listed in Table 1, and the heatmap is detailed further in Additional File 6. In contrast with the phenanthrene-induced downregulation of ACS6, the transcript was upregulated by B. cinerea attack and in other biotic stresses, oxidative stress, O3, SA, genotoxicity, indoleacetic acid (IAA), TIBA (inhibitor of polar auxin transport) and AgNO3 (inhibitor of ethylene signaling) treatments. WRKY40, a member of a transcription factor family that frequently plays critical roles in stress responses [28], followed a similar pattern. bHLH101, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, was sharply upregulated on the phenanthrene, O3, and genotoxicity microarrays, but little affected by the bacterial infections. AtOPT3, an oligopeptide transporter was similarly regulated. Among the hormone treatment microarrays, the SA dataset had the strongest correlation with the phenanthrene data (Spearman correlation ρ = 0.55, Table 1). In addition to PR-1 and other pathogen resistance (PR) genes, the phenanthrene microarray identified additional transcripts that indicate SA involvement. First, ICS1, an isochorismate synthase involved in SA biosynthesis, is normally induced by pathogen infection [29] and was upregulated on phenanthrene (Additional File 1). Second, the transcript of EDS5 (SID1), a MATE transporter necessary for SA signaling, was also upregulated by the PAH (Additional File 1), and is also induced in the O3, ultraviolet, and some biotic stress datasets. Finally, several SA early-response transcripts were induced on the phenanthrene and SA microarrays, including the UDP-glycosyl transferase UGT1 and GST25. Low correlations with the phenanthrene treatment were found for treatments with abscisic acid, the auxin transport inhibitor triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), brassinolide, cytokinin, the auxin indoleacetic acid, the gibberellic acid biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC), the ethylene precursor ACC, and the inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis, aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) (Table 1). However, treatment with AgNO3, which inhibits ethylene signaling [30], correlated noticeably with phenanthrene (ρ = 0.48). The inconsistency of the two ethylene inhibitors could be due to non-ethylene side-effects of AgNO3 or AVG. Analyzing the full set of ~23 × 103 probes on the microarray, these two treatments produced a paradoxically low Spearman correlation coefficient of ρ = 0.21, thereby supporting a side-effect hypothesis. Furthermore, the correlation between the AgNO3 and O3 microarray datasets was ρ = 0.60, hinting that silver nitrate induced oxidative stress. Taken together, these data indicate that the similarities between phenanthrene and AgNO3 induced stress responses are not related to perturbed ethylene signaling.Analyses of transgenic ethylene-responsive GUS-reporter plants Ethylene is commonly known as a stress hormone. The microarray results clearly indicated involvement of ethylene-regulated genes in the phenanthrene response, but the downregulated ethylene biosynthesis transcripts ACO2 and ACS6 suggested that the PAH reduced ethylene production. At the same time, comparisons of the phenanthrene data with ethylene inhibition and precursor spike-in datasets (AVG, AgNO3, and ACC in Table 1 and Figure 2) suggested that ethylene involvement was more nuanced than a global up- or down-regulation of ethylene signaling. To better understand this relationship, we analysed the role of ethylene under phenanthrene treatment more closely. First, to observe localized effects of phenanthrene on ethylene signaling targets, we used the transgenic reporter plants CH5B::GUS and AtGSTF2::GUS, which indicate GUS expression driven by ethylene-inducible promoters from the bean basic chitinase [31] and AtGSTF2 genes [19], respectively. Activation of transcription from the CH5B promoter in Arabidopsis leaves requires ethylene signaling through the ethylene receptor ETR1 [31]. In contrast, while being responsive to ethylene, the AtGSTF promoter can also be activated through an ETR1-independent mechanism after treatment with glutathione, paraquat, copper, and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) [19]. Figure 3 shows reporter gene expression in both lines when grown in long days in the presence of phenanthrene. In both lines, the reporter expression occurred in scattered patches on the leaf blades. These spatial patterns are similar to the patterns of necrotic lesions induced by phenanthrene [14]. To dissect the contributions of phenanthrene and ethylene in activating these promoters, the two reporter lines were grown in the dark for 4 d while treated with combinations of phenanthrene and ACC. Figure 4 shows that in both lines, compared to the untreated controls (Figure 4A and 4E), PAH treatment upregulated GUS expression (Figure 4C and 4G). The treatments with ACC alone (Figure 4B and 4F) or in combination with phenanthrene (Figure 4D and 4H) produced similar GUS expression patterns.Figure 3 Ethylene reporter gene expression in plants treated with phenanthrene and grown in long day light. Histochemical staining of GUS activity in CH5B::GUS (A, B), AtGSTF2::GUS (C, D) transgenic Arabidopsis plants in absence (A, C) or presence (B, D) of phenanthrene. Plants were grown in long days for 14 d. Seedlings were stained for 15 h for GUS activity in staining buffer containing 2 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-glucuronide. Scale bars 1 mm.Figure 4 Ethylene reporter gene expression in plants treated with phenanthrene and ACC, and grown in the dark. Histochemical staining of GUS activity in CH5B::GUS (A-D) and AtGSTF2::GUS (E-H) transgenic Arabidopsis plants grown for 4 d in the dark. A and E, 0 mM phenanthrene, 0 μM ACC; B and F, 0 mM phenanthrene, 20 μM ACC; C and G, 0.25 mM phenanthrene and 0 μM ACC; D and H, 0.25 mM phenanthrene, 20 μM ACC. Seedlings were stained for 15 h for GUS activity in staining buffer containing 2 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-glucuronide. Scale bars 1 mm. Although the histological GUS-assay is not quantitative, the relative intensity of staining can provide meaningful information. When treated with phenanthrene, GUS expression was generally stronger in AtGSTF2::GUS plants than in the CH5B::GUS plants (Figure 3 and Figure 4). The strongest GUS activity in CH5B::GUS was due to ACC treatment (Figure 4B). In contrast, in AtGSTF2::GUS GUS activity was strongest in plants exposed to both ACC and phenanthrene (Figure 4H).Responses of ethylene mutants to phenanthrene treatment To further determine whether PAH stress involves ethylene signaling, we compared the phenotypes of several ethylene mutants to WT Arabidopsis grown on phenanthrene-containing media. The classic triple response of dark-grown seedlings grown in the presence of ethylene produces an exaggerated apical hook, a thickened, short hypocotyl, and a short root. Utilizing this behavior, ethylene signaling mutants and WT were grown in the dark to examine how the mutations affected phenanthrene-induced growth responses in seedlings. The mutants included the ethylene overproducer eto3 [32]; the ethylene-insensitive gain-of-function receptor mutant etr1-4 [33]; the mutant etr1-7 [34,35] which exhibits slightly enhanced ethylene sensitivity, and the etr1-6;etr2-3;ein4-4 [34] triple ethylene receptor mutant which exhibits constitutive ethylene signaling. Because the WT and ethylene signaling mutants differ in root and shoot lengths even under control conditions, absolute length comparisons under phenanthrene treatment are not meaningful between genotypes. To facilitate comparison, the relative length change within each genotype was defined as the ratio (%) of phenanthrene-treated length to non-treated length. These response ratios were then compared between the genotypes. Figure 5 shows phenanthrene-induced hypocotyl growth responses in dark-grown seedlings. Phenanthrene treatment reduced hypocotyl elongation in all plants except in eto3, in which hypocotyl length was unaffected. As a baseline, the hypocotyls of WT were 12.0 ± 0.2 mm long on control medium, and 7.9 ± 0.1 mm long on 0.5 mM phenanthrene, giving a response ratio of 66 ± 1.3%. In the ethylene-overproduction mutant eto3, the length-reducing effect of phenanthrene was mitigated, producing hypocotyls as long as in the untreated control. Conversely, etr1-4, the ethylene-insensitive mutant grew to only 40 ± 4.8% of the length of the untreated mutant. The genotypes etr1-7 (response 60 ± 7.6%) and etr1-6;etr2-3;ein4-4 (response 67 ± 2.2%) did not differ significantly from WT in their hypocotyl responses to phenanthrene.Figure 5 Hypocotyl lengths of ethylene mutants treated with phenanthrene. Hypocotyl length of 4 d old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in absence or presence of phenanthrene in the dark. Top: Mean root lengths with standard error bars. Bottom: Response (%) is the ratio of root length on phenanthrene to root length without phenanthrene treatment. Bars represent mean ± error (see Methods section for calculation). Horizontal, dashed lines mark the error range for Columbia WT. At least ten seedlings were measured for each treatment and genotype. Root growth of phenanthrene-treated mutants differed markedly from the hypocotyl responses (Figure 6). Contrasting with the hypocotyl, root elongation of dark-grown WT was only marginally affected by phenanthrene, and the etr1-7 mutant was unaffected. Surprisingly, eto3 (response 174 ± 12%) and the triple mutant etr1-6;etr2-3;ein4-4 (response 187 ± 7.4%) grew even longer roots on phenanthrene than on control medium. In contrast, etr1-4 roots were significantly shorter on phenanthrene than on control medium (response 44 ± 4.7%).Figure 6 Root lengths of ethylene mutants treated with phenanthrene. Root length of 4-day old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in absence or presence of phenanthrene in the dark. For further explanations, see Figure 5 legend.Discussion Broadly, the response of Arabidopsis to phenanthrene is a complex perturbation of multiple systems, with a dominant theme of oxidative stress and similarities to pathogenic responses.Phenanthrene induces oxidative stress and a metabolic shift from anabolism to catabolism Consistent with physiological studies that associated PAH treatment with oxidative stress [10-12,14], transcripts related to oxidative stress were overrepresented among the phenanthrene responsive genes (Additional File 3 and Additional File 4e). In addition, polyamine levels and ADC enzyme activity were reported to increase in the aquatic plant Riccia fluitans when treated with phenanthrene [12], which is consistent with the present data that indicate an upregulation of ADC2 mRNA. At the systemic level, the microarray results bear strong resemblance to the transcriptional responses induced by fungal, bacterial pathogen, ozone or osmotic shock treatments (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1, and Additional File 4e). As the phenanthrene-treated plants were grown in sterile conditions, it is unlikely that the similarities to pathogen treatments were caused by confounding microbial effects. More likely, the unifying theme of these treatments is the production of ROS [15,36-40]. Following the initial oxidative burst, PAH-treated plants activate mechanisms similar to a pathogen defense including HR-like cell death [14] and induction of a battery of defense genes. Similar responses have been described in ozone-treated plants, which also generate ROS and erroneously activate pathogen defense programs [15]. However, while oxidative stress was occurring under phenanthrene treatment, several antioxidant genes were downregulated. This scenario can occur when plants invoke a positive feedback loop that amplifies ROS to serve as signaling molecules [28,41]. An early perturbation of the redox network is clear as downregulation of catalase mRNA [10], as well as increased H2O2 levels and cell death [14], were detected within 12 h of PAH treatment. Along similar lines, prior work in Arabidopsis found CAT2 downregulated within three hours of O3 treatment [42]. Supporting the notion of ROS positive feedback activation, the respiratory burst oxidase AtRbohD was upregulated in phenanthrene-treated plants (Additional File 5), and was similarly upregulated by O3 and pathogenic attack conditions. Similarly, the tobacco ortholog NtrbohD was induced during an oxidative burst under O3 treatment [15]. The widespread destruction of chloroplast and mitochondrial membranes [10] may have injected additional ROS into the system. PAH treatment caused downregulation of genes involved in photosynthesis and protein biosynthesis (Additional File 3 and Additional File 4a), which agrees with previous studies reporting overall diminished plant size and reduced chlorophyll levels [10,14]. Up-regulation of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle (Additional File 3 and Additional File 4a), as well as the similarity to the senescence microarray data (Table 1, Figure 2), further reveal a major metabolic shift from anabolism to catabolism. In addition, growth inhibition and the breakdown of the photosynthetic machinery are commonly observed ethylene effects [16].Phenanthrene interferes with hormone signaling networks Results presented here suggest that the complex physiological PAH stress symptoms likely involve multiple hormone pathways, including SA, ethylene, JA, and abscisic acid (ABA). Furthermore, the GUS expression patterns in phenanthrene-treated CH5B::GUS and AtGSTF2::GUS lines suggest that ethylene and SA levels are locally elevated in PAH-stressed plant tissues (Figure 3 and Figure 4). The spatial patterns in leaves resemble previous observations of phenanthrene-induced, localized cell death and H2O2accumulation [14], supporting the hypothesis that, in addition to SA, ethylene is involved in the development of the PAH symptoms. Interestingly, reporter activity was consistently more pronounced in PAH-treated AtGSTF2::GUS than in the CH5B::GUS transgenic plants (Figure 3 and Figure 4). This difference in GUS expression may be caused by a differential ethylene sensitivity of the two promoters. This explanation is plausible as the CH5B promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis leaves is approximately an order of magnitude less sensitive to ethylene than the endogenous basic chitinase promoter [31]. A further explanation for the differential reporter levels is that the two transcriptional programs involve other signals in addition to ethylene [19,31]. Indeed, SA signaling is necessary for strong AtGSTF2 induction by ethylene [43]. Analyses of quantitative growth responses of dark-grown ethylene mutants exposed to phenanthrene revealed further interesting interactions between phenanthrene and ethylene signaling. Without PAH, the ethylene overproducer eto3 and the constitutively-signaling triple mutant grew short hypocotyls and roots, consistent with the standard model of ethylene-induced growth reduction. However, when treated with phenanthrene, these two lines grew longer roots than on control medium, suggesting that the treatment inhibits ethylene signal transduction. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that the exaggerated apical hook, which is typical in ACC-treated dark-grown plants (Figure 4B and 4F), was absent in PAH-treated plants (Figure 4D and 4H). This phenotype was frequently observed in WT plants treated with both ACC and phenanthrene (not shown). The observation that typical triple-response symptoms were attenuated under phenanthrene treatment suggests that the PAH negatively interferes with the ethylene signal transduction pathway or with ethylene biosynthesis in conditions of elevated ethylene levels or signaling. It has been proposed that ethylene can exhibit inhibiting or stimulating effect on growth, depending on the ethylene concentration [16]. Furthermore, the ethylene-insensitive etr1-4 mutant responded to the PAH with significantly stronger growth inhibition than the WT. This result clearly shows that the phenanthrene-induced growth reduction does not require ethylene signaling through the ETR1 receptor. Taken together, the mutant experiments suggest that ethylene is not required for the development of some of the PAH stress symptoms, and, phenanthrene inhibits some ethylene responses under conditions of elevated ethylene levels.Integrated model of PAH response in Arabidopsis With these and previous results taken in total, we propose a model of the PAH response in plants. Shortly following uptake, the PAH molecules may be oxidized by mono- or dioxygenases into reactive compounds. An analogous biochemical process occurs in animals, catalyzed by cytochrome P450s [44,45], producing toxic and mutagenic electrophiles. ROS deriving from PAH oxidation would increase the overall ROS level, and thereby contribute towards activation of ROS-dependent signaling pathways. Alternatively, the PAH molecule may be directly recognized by a receptor such as a PAS-domain protein, a large and widely-distributed class of environmental sensors that includes the vertebrate aryl hydrocarbon receptor [46,47]. The strong similarities to biotic stress also suggest that the PAH could be cross-reacting with a pathogen recognition system. Regardless of the initial mechanism of action, the hormones SA, ethylene, and JA appear to be involved in the response, and other unidentified signals also are likely relevant. Finally, the oxidized intermediates can be conjugated with a sugar or glutathione, and sequestered into the vacuole or cell wall. The initial PAH or its downstream products have been shown to accumulate in trichomes and other epidermal cells [14], although the recognition and transport mechanisms remain unknown. Additional studies will help elucidate causality in the complex PAH stress response. It would be instructive to perform high-resolution time-series experiments to measure transcripts implicated in the earliest modes of action, as well as direct measurement of hormone levels. In addition, it would be valuable to perform tissue-specific molecular and enzyme assays, particularly of the zones implicated by the positive GUS results and necrotic areas. Furthermore, in addition to the ethylene mutants, the PAH response in other signaling mutants should be analysed. Even though many remaining questions surround PAH stress, the microarray data provide a number of leads for improving PAH phytoremediation. Relaxing the rate- and capacity-limiting bottlenecks in the PAH detoxification pathway would reduce the cytoplasmic concentration of PAHs, thereby decreasing the effective toxicity to the plant and allowing increased uptake of the pollutant. For example, further increasing GST and UGT protein levels, or artificially up-regulating vacuolar transporters of conjugated xenobiotics, may produce plants with improved phytoremediation capabilities. The present results, as well as the suggested follow-on research, will be of great value in breeding and engineering plants for phytoremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.Conclusions The microarray experiments and comparative analyses show that phenanthrene treatment of Arabidopsis induces oxidative stress networks, closely resembling pathogen defense programs. A battery of altered transcripts revealed perturbations of the ROS, HR, and SAR systems. The present data support the hypothesis that the hormones SA, ethylene, and JA are involved in PAH response. In total, the results provide a large number of new pathway targets for researching and engineering plants for PAH phytoremediation.MethodsPlants and Growth Conditions Seeds of the Arabidopsis ecotype Colombia were obtained from Arabidopsis Research Centre and used as the WT control in all experiments. Seeds of the mutants eto3, etr1-7, etr1-4, and etr1-6;etr2-3;ein4-4 were a gift from Eric Schaller or were obtained from ABRC. Seeds of AtGSTF2::GUS fusion plants [19] were a gift from Peter Goldsbrough. Seeds of bean basic chitinase CH5B::GUS fusion plants [31] were a gift from Sara Patterson. Seeds were surface-sterilized, stratified, and placed in Petri dishes containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium, supplemented with sucrose and 0, 0.25 or 0.5 mM of phenanthrene, as described previously [14]. ACC was added to the growth medium in appropriate amounts before autoclaving. Plants were grown at 23 ± 1°C either in the dark or under long-day conditions (16/8 h photoperiod at approximately 130 μmol photons m-2s-1) for 4-21 d as indicated in the text. Before plates were put in darkness, they were exposed to white light for 10-12 h to achieve uniform germination. When root or hypocotyl lengths were to be measured, plates were kept in vertical orientation. Each plate contained seeds of the WT Columbia and at least of one mutant. Plants were observed under a Zeiss 2000-C dissection microscope equipped with an Olympus 340 digital camera. All experiments were conducted at least twice with each mutant, with at least ten plants of each genotype per treatment.DNA Microarray Analysis PAH treated (0.25 mM phenanthrene) and control plants (0 mM phenanthrene) were grown under long days and harvested at 21 d, and at least 20 plants were pooled and stored at -80°C. 500 mg tissue was removed from each pool and RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Molecular Research Center) per the manufacturer's instructions. Resulting samples were treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) and purified with RNeasy Mini Cleanup (Qiagen) per the manufacturers' instructions. Labeling was performed with the Affymetrix Enzo kit and processed on a Affymetrix Fluidics Station Model 450. Hybridized chips were read on a model M10 scanner. Two rounds of biological replication were analyzed. In the first replicate, treated and control samples were each run on one Affymetrix ATH1-121501 microarray. In the second biological replicate, the treated sample was applied to one microarray, and the control sample was applied to two microarrays as a technical replicate. See Additional File 7, Additional File 8, and Additional File 9 for further technical details on the microarray experiment. Validating the microarray data, previous RT-PCR analysis of actin-7, eif4a, PR-1, PDF1.2b, and AtEXP8 [14] (and unpublished data) are consistent with the present results. In addition, using RT-qPCR with four replicates per reaction and actin-7 as a reference, we validated that the differential responses for GSTF6 and PR-1 are consistent with the microarray dataset (data not shown).Bioinformatic Analyses Data analysis was performed in R version 2.9.2 [48] and Bioconductor version 2.4.1 [49] installed on x86 hardware running Debian Linux Version 5.0. All of the procedures below were scripted in R and Python software written for this project. To determine differential expression of the phenanthrene microarray dataset, the Affymetrix .CEL files were normalized by the Bioconductor just.gcrma algorithm using default parameters [50]. To reduce the false discovery rate, nonspecific prefiltering was performed using the Bioconductor genefilter package, eliminating probes with raw signal intensity less than 100 on all microarrays, and eliminating probes with an interquartile intensity ratio of less than 1.41 across the microarrays. The prefiltered set was then tested for statistical significance by a linear model using Limma [51], corrected for multiple comparisons with a Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate limit of 0.05. To identify genes with putative biological significance, probes with differential expression ratios greater than 2-fold up or 2-fold down were preserved, and these remaining probes were defined as the set of 1031 differentially-expressed, phenanthrene responsive genes used in subsequent analysis. The Affymetrix probe identifiers were mapped to Arabidopsis Genome Identifiers (AGIs), symbols, and annotations using the ath1121501.db metadata in Bioconductor. To compare the phenanthrene microarray data with published microarray data, Affymetrix ATH1 .CEL files were obtained from the AffyWatch service of the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info. The published .CEL files and our phenanthrene .CEL files were normalized together using just.gcrma as described above. To perform the hierarchical clustering shown by the heatmap, Kendall tau correlation matrices between genes and experiments were computed, and complete linkage clustering was computed by the R hclust function. The resulting clustering was visualized by the R heatmap.2 algorithm. Gene ontology analysis for overrepresented biological process (BP) terms was performed with the GOstats package of Bioconductor [52]. The set of 1031 differentially-expressed probes was partitioned into up-regulated and down-regulated subsets, and their Affymetrix probe identifiers were mapped to Arabidopsis Genome Identifiers (AGI). These AGI sets were tested against the universe of probed AGIs using the hyperGTest function, using a p-value cutoff of 0.05 and with the conditional scoring algorithm enabled. MapMan [53] maps were produced to visualize cellular processes affected by the phenanthrene treatment. log2-transformed mean differences between transcript signals in phenanthrene-treated and control microarrays served as input to MapMan.Root and Shoot Measurements Root and shoot lengths were measured on digital photographs using NIH ImageJ v 1.3.1_13 software [54]. In each experiment phenanthrene response percentage (R) of a genotype was calculated as R = 100 × (AV Ep/AV Ec), where AV Ep is the mean organ length in phenanthrene treatment and AV Ec is the mean organ length in control (i.e., in absence of phenanthrene). Error of R (RE) was calculated as , where δc and δp are standard deviations of organ length in control and phenanthrene treatment, respectively; nc and np are numbers of roots or hypocotyls measured in control and phenanthrene treatment, respectively. In the root and hypocotyl length assay mutant's response to phenanthrene Rm was considered significantly different from the WT response (R [wt]), if the intervals [Rwt - REwt, Rwt + REwt] for the WT, and [Rm - REm, Rm + REm] for the mutant, did not overlap.Histochemistry GUS-staining was performed as described by [55]. To facilitate relative comparisons of reporter activity, identical GUS staining conditions were used in all experiments. For all histochemical methods whole plants or shoots were photographed under a Zeiss 2000-C dissecting microscope equipped with an Olympus 340 digital camera before and after staining. Images representative of at least ten plants per treatment and experiment are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.Authors' contributions DW performed the microarray experiments and bioinformatics analyses.

The genetics of primary CoQ10 deficiency has been described in several studies, whereas the influence of common genetic variants on CoQ10 status is largely unknown. Here we tested for non-synonymous single-nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNP) in genes involved in the biosynthesis (CoQ3G272S , CoQ6M406V, CoQ7M103T), reduction (NQO1P187S, NQO2L47F) and metabolism (apoE3/4) of CoQ10 and their association with CoQ10 status. For this purpose, CoQ10 serum levels of 54 healthy male volunteers were determined before (T0) and after a 14 days supplementation (T14) with 150 mg/d of the reduced form of CoQ10. At T0, the CoQ10 level of heterozygous NQO1P187S carriers were significantly lower than homozygous S/S carriers (0.93 ± 0.25 μM versus 1.34 ± 0.42 μM, p = 0.044). For this polymorphism a structure homology-based method (PolyPhen) revealed a possibly damaging effect on NQO1 protein activity. Furthermore, CoQ10 plasma levels were significantly increased in apoE4/E4 genotype after supplementation in comparison to apoE2/E3 genotype (5.93 ± 0.151 μM versus 4.38 ± 0.792 μM, p = 0.034). Likewise heterozygous CoQ3G272S carriers had higher CoQ10 plasma levels at T14 compared to G/G carriers but this difference did not reach significance (5.30 ± 0.96 μM versus 4.42 ± 1.67 μM, p = 0.082). In conclusion, our pilot study provides evidence that NQO1P187S and apoE polymorphisms influence CoQ10 status in humans.

In conclusion, our pilot study provides evidence that NQO1P187S and apoE polymorphisms influence CoQ10 status in humans. Background Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is the predominant form of endogenous ubiquinone in humans. Synthesized in the mitochondrial inner membrane, CoQ10 is comprised of a ubiquinone head group attached to a trial of 10 five-carbon isoprenoid units, that anchors the molecule to the membranes [1]. Intracellular synthesis is the major source of CoQ10, however it can also be acquired through the diet and dietary supplements [2]. CoQ10 acts in the respiratory chain and is necessary for pyrimidine biosynthesis as well as a cofactor of uncoupling proteins [3]. CoQ10 has been also identified as a modulator of gene expression [4-6], inflammatory processes [7-9] and apoptosis [10,11]. The CoQ10 biosynthetic pathway comprises 10 steps, including methylations, decarboxylations, hydroxylations and isoprenoid synthesis and transfer [12]. The elucidation of this pathway was mainly due to studies in respiration-deficient mutans of E. coli and S. cerevisiae [13,14]. In humans, rare genetic variants in genes encoding enzymes of CoQ10 synthesis causes mitochondrial dysfunction, as CoQ10 carries electrons from complex I and complex II to complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Several forms of human CoQ10 deficiencies were characterized by infantile encephalomyopathy, renal failure, cerebellar ataxia or myopathy [15-17]. The complexity of CoQ10 biosynthesis suggests that genetic defects in different biosynthetic enzymes or regulatory proteins may cause different clinical syndromes. Although several studies have been undertaken to look into primary CoQ10 deficiency, the influence of common genetic variants on CoQ10 status is largely unknown. Therefore a proof of principle study in humans was performed to associate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding proteins of CoQ10 biosynthesis, reduction and metabolism with CoQ10 status before and after supplementation.MethodsParticipants and study design Sample characteristics of subjects and study design have been recently described [18]. In short: 54 healthy male volunteers received 150 mg of the reduced form of CoQ10 (ubiquinol, KANEKA Corporation, Japan) daily in form of three capsules with each principal meal for 14 days. Fasting blood samples were taken before (T0) and after (T14) supplementation with ubiquinol from all study participants. The participants, aged 30.1 ± 6.7 years, had an average Body Mass Index (BMI) of 24.1 ± 2.5, no history of gastrointestinal, hepatic, cardiovascular or renal diseases, a habit of non- or occasional smoking (≤ 3 cigarettes/day) and maintenance of usual nutrition habits. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of Kiel University, Germany, and was conformed to Helsinki Declaration. All volunteers gave written informed consent.Genotyping Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood samples. Genotyping of all SNPs investigated (Table 1) was performed with the TaqMan system. Fluorescence was measured with ABI Prism 7900 HT sequence detection system (ABI, Foster City, USA).Table 1 Selected polymorphisms in CoQ3, CoQ6, CoQ7, NQO1, NQO2 and apoE geneGenerefSNPidaSequencebPositionAmino acid changeCoQ3rs6925344ACAATAC[C/T]TGCAATTexon 6Gly272SerCoQ6rs8500AGGTTCC[A/G]TGAGCCAexon 11Met406ValCoQ7rs11074359ATGGTTA[T/C]GTTCAGGexon 3Met103ThrNQO1rs1800566AGTTGAG[A/G]TTCTAAG*exon 6Pro187SerNQO2rs1143684CATGAAC[C/T]TTGAGCCexon 3Leu47PheapoErs429358GGACGTG[C/T]GCGGCCexon 4Arg112CysapoErs7412GCAGAAG[C/T]GCCTGGexon 4Arg158Cys a: NCBI; b: Applied Biosystems, *antisenseHPLC analysis CoQ10 analysis was based on the method of high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection and internal standardisation using ubihydroquinone-9 and ubiquinone-9 as standards and has been described elsewhere [18].Statistical analysis Data are expressed as means ± SD. Differences in the characteristics of the study population between two genotype groups were examined using the Student t-test and additionally for CoQ6M406V the χ2 -test in a dominant genetic model. To determine statistical significance between all genotypes, test for linear trend in one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant and all statistical analyses were computed using SPSS (Version 13.0). In order to analyze the impact of non-synonymous SNPs on the structure and function of proteins, PolyPhen server [19] was used. For power calculation, the GPower program (Version 3.1) was applied.Results and DiscussionSelection of genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms In order to identify common SNPs which may be associated with the CoQ10 status, we searched in the HapMap data base for non-synonymous variants in genes which are involved in CoQ10 biosynthesis and metabolism. As shown in table 1, we selected SNPs in the CoQ3 (rs6925344, C>T, Gly272Ser), CoQ6 (rs8500, A>G, Met406Val) and CoQ7 (rs11074359, T>C, Met103Thr) gene. These genes code for enzymes of CoQ10 biosynthesis. Functional variants [20,21] in the NQO1 (rs1800566, C>T, Pro187Ser) and NQO2 (rs1143684, T>C, Leu47Phe) gene were also included, as the encoded NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductases are involved in the recycling of CoQ10. Furthermore they protect cells from oxidative damage by catalyzing reduction of carcinogenic quinone compounds to their hydroquinone forms [22]. Two SNPs determining the apolipoprotein E (apoE) haplotypes E2, E3 and E4 (rs429358, rs7412) were further included. Both SNPs led to an amino acid change from cysteine to arginine at position 112 (rs429358) and 158 (rs7412), which gives rise to six possible diplotypes: E2/E2, E2/E3, E2/E4, E3/E3, E3/E4 and E4/E4. The apoE diplotypes have been associated with cholesterol metabolism [23,24], atherosclerosis [25], inflammation [26], lipid peroxidation [27] and longevity [28].Genotype distributions in the cohort The selected SNPs were genotyped in 54 healthy male volunteers. The obtained genotype distribution (Figure 1 and 2) were in accordance to the HapMap data: Genotype distribution of the CoQ3G272S polymorphism revealed 38 homozygous for G/G (73%), 13 heterozygous for G/S (25%) and 1 homozygous for S/S (2%), while 1 sample failed genotyping. Analysis of the CoQ6M406V genotype showed 19 homozygous for M/M (36%), 24 heterozygous for M/V (44%) and 11 homozygous for V/V (20%). Genotyping of CoQ7M103T polymorphism revealed 25 M/M (48%), 17 M/T (33%) and 10 T/T (19%) carriers. Two samples failed genotyping. Concerning the distribution of the NQO1P187S SNP, 30 persons are carriers of two P/P alleles (56%), 22 persons were heterozygous with one P and one S allele (41%) and two participants were carriers of two S/S alleles (3%). NQO2L47F genotyping displayed 35 participants were homozygous L/L carriers (65%), 15 participants were heterozygous for L/F (28%) and 4 participants were homozygous F/F carriers (7%). The genotype distribution of apoE was as follows: 1 person with E2/E2 genotype (2%), 7 persons with E2/E3 (14%), 29 persons with E3/E3 (58%), 11 persons with E3/E4 (22%) and 2 persons with E4/E4 (4%). For 4 persons, genotyping of one or both SNPs respectively failed. Thus, the Apo E genotype distribution in our cohort of 54 healthy men was comparable with previously published data [29,30].Figure 1 Effect of amino acid exchange polymorphisms on CoQ10 plasma levels. SNPs in genes encoding enzymes of the CoQ10 synthesis pathway (CoQ3G272S, CoQ6M406V, CoQ7M103T) before (T0) and after (T14) ubiquinol supplementation (150 mg/day) in humans are shown. Values are mean ± SD and n numbers (genotype distribution) are given in brackets. Differences between two genotype groups were examined using Student t-test and between all genotypes using "test for linear trend" (ANOVA).Figure 2 Effect of NQO1P187S, NQO2L47F and apoE genotype distribution on CoQ10 plasma levels. CoQ10 plasma levels before (T0) and after (T14) ubiquinol supplementation (150 mg/day) in humans are shown. Values are mean ± SD and n numbers (genotype distribution) are given in brackets. Differences between two genotype groups were examined using Student t-test (*p ≤ 0.05) and between all genotypes using "test for linear trend" (ANOVA).Association between genotypes and CoQ10 level at baseline T0 and after supplementation T14 with the reduced form of CoQ10 As previously described [18], 54 healthy male volunteers received 150 mg of the reduced form of CoQ10 daily in form of three capsules with each principal meal for 14 days. This supplementation led to a significant 4-fold increase in total CoQ10 plasma levels at T14 (4.60 ± 1.55 μmol/L) compared to T0 (0.96 ± 0.31 μmol/L) [18]. As shown in Figure 1 and 2, SNPs determined in the CoQ7 and NQO2 genes were not associated with total CoQ10 levels. Trend analysis (ANOVA) over all genotype variants of CoQ7M103T and NQO2L47F revealed p values >0.05 and were therefore considered as not significant.CoQ3G272S The COQ3 gene encodes an O-methyltransferase required for two steps in the biosynthetic pathway of CoQ10 [31]. Analysing CoQ3 rs6925344 SNP in association to plasma CoQ10 levels at T0, no significant differences between genotypes could be revealed. Yet at T14, G/S carriers in CoQ3G272S genotype had a higher total CoQ10 content (5.30 ± 0.96 μmol/L) after supplementation compared to G/G carriers (4.42 ± 1.67 μmol/L) with borderline significance (p = 0.082, t-test).CoQ6M406V CoQ6 is mapped to human chromosome 14q24.3 and encodes a monooygenase, which is required in CoQ10 biosynthesis for incorporation of oxygen to the benzoquinone ring [32]. CoQ10 plasma levels were not significantly changed within genotype distribution of CoQ6 rs8500 SNP before (T0) and after (T14) supplementation. However, considering total CoQ10 distribution at T0 in a chi-square cross tabulation as a function of CoQ6 rs8500 genotype (Table 2) a person chi-square χ2 value of p = 0.081 was evident, which again can be considered as marginal significant. Therefore a power calculation for CoQ6 genotype rs8500 was conducted using GPower program (Version 3.1). This disclosed a total of 898 individuals are required to receive 95% power.Table 2 Total CoQ10 distribution in a chi-square crosstabulation as a function of CoQ6M406V genotype (rs8500).Pearson Χ2CoQ6(rs8500)< 0.96(μmol/L)> 0.96(μmol/L)TotalM/M71219M/V+V/V211334Total282553 Person Chi-Square Χ2: p = 0.081 Distribution was calculated according to a dominant model. CoQ10 mean value of 0.96 μmol/L was used for group classification.NQO1P187S It has been shown, that NQO1 can generate and maintain the reduced state of ubiquinones in membrane systems and liposomes, thereby promoting their antioxidant function [33,34]. NQO1P187S SNP was associated with CoQ10 levels at T0 (P/S versus S/S, p = 0.044). Thus, this pilot study indicates that Pro187Ser SNP in NQO1 gene could participate in abnormal CoQ10 metabolism. SNP prediction of functional effects of human nsSNPs with structure homology-based method (PolyPhen) revealed a possibly damaging effect of NQO1P187S SNP with a score of 0.215. However, genotype distribution of the S/S genotype was low (n = 2), which reflects the ethnic variation of this polymorphism with the highest prevalence of the S allele in East Asian populations (e.g. 22% prevalence in Chinese populations) and the lowest prevalence in Caucasians (4%) [35]. Furthermore Han et al [36] found a significant association of this SNP with carotid artery plaques in type 2 diabetic patients in east Asian populations. As this genetic variation may play a more significant role in an East Asian rather than in a Caucasian population, evaluation of the Pro187Ser SNP in association with CoQ10 metabolism in an East Asian population may be preferable.apoE Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a polymorphic multifunctional protein with three common isoforms in humans (E2, E3 and E4). Presence of the apoE4 allele is associated with a 40-50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease [37]. There is increasing evidence demonstrating that the apoE4 allele may be associated with elevated oxidative stress and chronic inflammation [38]. Thus apoE was considered as a candidate gene explaining variance in CoQ10 status. At T0, total CoQ10 levels were higher in E4/E4 carriers as compared to all other genotype groups, however p values did not reached significance (p = 0.065, E2/E3 vs E4/E4, Figure 2). These results confirm the results found by Battino et al [29] in a cohort of 106 healthy blood donors. Interestingly, in our study total CoQ10 levels increased significantly (p = 0.034) in E4/E4 carriers after supplementation (T14), which has to the best of our knowledge not been shown so far. Thus, E4/E4 carriers may be more responsive towards a dietary CoQ10 supplementation than non E2/E3 carriers. The underlying physiological and/or molecular mechanisms for this finding still need to be elucidated.Conclusions Taken together, our pilot study with 54 volunteers provides evidence that NQO1P187S and apoE polymorphisms may influence CoQ10 status in humans. According to our results and power calculation, larger cohorts are needed in further studies to determine the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins of CoQ10 biosynthesis, reduction and metabolism and CoQ10 status.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributions AF analysed the data and wrote the manuscript.

In the case of the caspase-3 deficient MCF-7 breast cancer cells, this growth suppression has been shown to be partially mediated by the induction of apoptosis.

These results suggest that protein methylation cooperates with DAL-1/4.1B-associated caspase 8-specific activation to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Background Differentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung (DAL-1)/4.1B is a tumor suppressor gene belonging to the Protein 4.1 superfamily [1]. Like other members of this family, DAL-1/4.1B localizes to the cell membrane and contains an N-terminal 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domain [2] and spectrin/actin binding sequences. When introduced into DAL-1/4.1B-null lung, breast and meningioma cancer cell lines, this Protein 4.1 family member significantly suppresses growth, in part through the induction of apoptosis [1,3,4]. However, the pathways via which DAL-1/4.1B exerts its growth suppressing properties are still poorly understood. The FERM domain of the founding family member Protein 4.1R has been found to associate with several membrane proteins, including erythrocyte band 3, calmodulin, glycophorin C, p55 and spliceosome-associated pICln [5-7]. Similarly, merlin/NF2 associates with several transmembrane proteins including CD44 via residues in the N-terminal FERM domain [8,9]. The interaction of merlin/NF2 with CD44 has been shown to be critical for its growth suppression [8,10]. Hypothesizing that the unique binding partners for DAL-1/4.1B may help elucidate its mechanism of action as a negative growth regulator, yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed using the 336 residues of DAL-1/4.1B FERM domain and a fetal lung cDNA library. Several strongly associating proteins, including 14-3-3 protein isoforms β, γ and η [11] and protein arginine N-methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) [12] were identified. PRMT3 and its family members post-translationally form asymmetric ω-NG, NG- (Type I enzymes; PRMT1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) or symmetric w-NG, N'G- (Type II enzymes; PRMT5) dimethylarginine residues on proteins. This protein modification has been shown to regulate transduction of signals to the nucleus, transcription regulation through nuclear receptors, and RNA transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm [13-19] Recently we have reported that DAL-1/4.1B regulates the methylation of substrates by PRMT3 [12] and PRMT5 [20] both in vitro and in cultured cells. Based on these findings, post-translational protein methylation may be one mechanism by which DAL-1/4.1B suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. To address this, DAL-1/4.1B-induced apoptosis and caspase activation were analyzed in both control and hypomethylated MCF-7 cells. These studies show that DAL-1/4.1B induces apoptosis via caspase 8 activation and that hypomethylation of cellular proteins increases apoptosis as well as DAL-1/4.1B protein levels. These findings suggest that the interaction of the tumor suppressor DAL-1/4.1B and protein methylation pathway components is biologically important in controlling tumorigenesis.ResultsDAL-1/4.1B induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells via a caspase 8 dependent pathway Previous work from this laboratory identified DAL-1/4.1B protein as a growth suppressor and apoptosis-inducing protein in MCF-7 cells, which themselves do not express endogenous DAL-1/4.1B [3]. In agreement with this finding, DAL-1/4.1B-inducible MCF-7 Cl27 cells underwent apoptosis when treated with 2 μM Muristerone A for 48 hours to induce DAL-1/4.1B expression. The presence of DAL-1/4.1B protein was confirmed by both Western blot analysis and flow cytometry (FACS)(Figure 1A and 1B). TUNEL analysis revealed that 48 hours of DAL-1/4.1B protein expression induced apoptosis. Not all cells in the MCF-7 Cl27 clone express robust levels of DAL-1/4.1B protein, even after repeated subcloning. Therefore we also analyzed the sub-population of cells that showed high levels of DAL-1/4.1B protein. In that analysis, apoptosis levels reached approximately 80% (Figure 1C).Figure 1 Induction of DAL-1/4.1B-expression in MCF7 Cl27 cells induces apoptosis. A. Western blot analysis showing the induction of DAL-1/4.1B protein in MCF-7 Cl27 cells following treatment with 2 μM muristerone for 48 hours. B. Flow cytometric analysis confirming the induction of DAL-1/4.1B in cells treated with 2 μM Muristerone (clear peak) as compared to untreated cells (grey peak). C. The level of apoptosis in the total cell population and in cells specifically expressing measurable levels of DAL-1/4.1B protein was determined by TUNEL assay and detected by FACS. To better understand the apoptotic mechanisms invoked in MCF-7 cells upon expression of DAL-1/4.1B, global as well as specific caspase activation was examined. FAM-VAD-FMK, a potent inhibitor of caspase activity that irreversibly binds to the reactive cysteine residue of the large subunit of caspases 1–9, was incubated with MCF-7 Cl27 cells with or without induction of DAL-1/4.1B protein expression to assess global caspase activation. These probes utilize carboxyfluorescein(FAM)-labeled peptide fluoromethyl ketone (FMK) caspase inhibitors (FAM-peptide-FMK) and allow the fluorescent detection of active caspases in living cell systems. As shown in Figure 2A, the presence of DAL-1/4.1B protein increased global caspase activation levels by 2.5-fold suggesting that DAL-1/4.1B-induced apoptosis proceeds through a caspase-dependent pathway.Figure 2 Caspase activation in DAL-1/4.1B-induced MCF-7 cells. A. Global caspase activation in cells treated with 2 μM Muristerone for 48 hours or 1 μM staurosporine (STS) for 4 hours. B.

Clear bars represent untreated cells; grey bars represent DAL-1/4.1B-expressing cells. Caspase 1, p = 0.232; Caspase 2, p = 0.64; Caspase 6, p = 0.625; Caspase 8, p = 0.007; Caspase 9, p = 0.16; Caspase 10, p = 0.10; Caspase 13, p = 0.039. C. Caspase 7 activation was investigated by Western blot analysis of PARP cleavage on proten lysates from uninduced and DAL-1/4.1B-induced MCF-7 Cl27 cells. D. Inhibition of caspase 8 activation blocks DAL-1/4.1B-associated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. This suggests that caspase 8 activation is critical for the induction of cell death by this tumor suppressor protein. Three main effector caspases, caspases 3, 6 and 7, are thought to be directly involved in the execution of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Importantly, MCF-7, as well as the derivative DAL-1/4.1B-inducible Cl27 cell line, are Caspase 3-deficient [21]. Therefore, we tested the ability of DAL-1/4.1B expression to activate specific caspases other than caspase 3 and including caspases 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 13. Using caspase specific binding peptides, only caspase 8 (p = 0.007) showed highly statistically significant activation when compared with cells without DAL-1/4.B (Figure 2B). Caspase 7 is thought to function downstream of caspase 3 but in some cases, caspase-7 can be activated in caspase-3 deficient cells, inducing cleavage of PARP [22-25]. Western blot analysis shows no PARP cleavage in response to induced DAL-1/4.1B expression (Figure 2C), suggesting that Caspase-7 is not specifically activated during DAL-1/4.1B-associated apoptosis in these cells. If caspase 8 is directly involved in DAL-1/4.1B-associated apoptosis, then inhibition of caspase 8 activation should prevent cells from dying in response to the presence of the DAL-1/4.1B protein. In support of this hypothesis, incubation of DAL-1/4.1B-expressing MCF-7 Cl27 cells with the caspase 8-specific inhibitor z-IETD-FMK resulted in blockage of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2D). Incubation of cells with this inhibitor in the absence of DAL-1/4.1B protein had no effect. Several publications have previously documented the ability of caspase 8 activation to mediate the cleavage of downstream substrates and induce apoptosis in the absence of activation of downstream effecter caspases 3, 6 and 7 [26]. Therefore, DAL-1/4.1B-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 Cl27 cells may involve a caspase 8-dependent pathway which functions independent of the major effector caspase pathways. While our data suggests that caspase 8 is primarily involved in DAL-1/4.1B mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, the possibility that caspase 3 would also be activated, if present, was tested. To this end, caspase 3-expressing MCF-7 Cl27 cells were generated [21,27] and caspase 3 expression confirmed in several isolated clones (Figure 3A). Subsequent induction of DAL-1/4.1B expression in these clones (as represented by Cl27.11 in Figure 3B) did not enhance the previously measured level of apoptosis in these cells (8%) [3] suggesting that DAL-1/4.1B-associated apoptosis does not require this major effector caspase.Figure 3 Restoration of caspase 3 expression does not enhance DAL-1/4.1B-induced apoptosis. A. Western blot analysis of Caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 and DAL-1/4.1B-inducible Cl27 cells. CL 27.2, CL 27.7 and CL 27.11 are Caspase-3-expressing MCF-7 DAL-1/4.1B-inducible clones. B. Apoptosis levels measured up to 4 days after DAL-1/4.1B -expression in MCF-7 CL 27.11 cells. TUNEL positive cells were counted in a microscopic field of 200 cells as previously reported [3] The expression of Caspase-3 does not significantly alter the apoptosis levels over that previously shown in Figure 2A for the caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 Cl27 cells.Protein methylation and DAL-1/4.1B cooperate to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells Given that DAL-1/4.1B has recently been shown to modulate the ability of the arginine methyltransferases PRMT3 [12] and PRMT5 [20] to methylate cellular substrates, we asked whether posttranslational protein methylation might also play a role in DAL-1/4.1B-associated apoptosis. To address this, DAL-1/4.1B-inducible MCF-7 Cl27 cells were grown for 48 hours in the presence of 30 μM periodate-oxidized adenosine (AdOX). AdOX, an inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase, which elevates the levels of AdoHcy in cultured mammalian cells. Since AdoHcy is a product inhibitor of methyltransferases using AdoMet as the methyl donor, AdOX can reduce the activity of protein methyltransferases in cultured cells and consequently allow the accumulation of hypomethylated protein substrates. Hypomethylated MCF-7 Cl27 cell lysates were collected and the methylation status of endogenous PRMT substrates analyzed by Western blot using the anti-asymmetric dimethylarginine antibody ASYM 24. Figure 4A shows that asymmetrically dimethylated proteins in MCF-7 Cl27 cells were significantly, although not completely, inhibited by treatment with 30 μM AdOX. Higher AdOX concentrations resulted in significant cellular toxicity (data not shown).Figure 4 Hypomethylation modulates apoptosis in MCF-7 Cl27 cells. A. Western blot analysis with the anti-asymmetric dimethylarginine antibody ASYM24 (Upstate Biochemical) shows significant reduction in the methylation of proteins in MCF-7 Cl27 cells when treated with 30 μM AdOX for 48 hours. B. TUNEL and global caspase activation assays show that AdOX-associated hypomethylation specifically increases the percentage of apoptotic cells in the presence of DAL-1/4.1B protein. Grey bars show the percentage of apoptotic cells as measured by TUNEL. Black bars represent the percentage of global caspase activation. To determine the effect of protein hypomethylation on DAL-1/4.1B-induced apoptosis, MCF-7 Cl27 cells were induced to express DAL-1/4.1B protein in the presence of 30 μM AdOX and analyzed for apoptosis levels as well as global caspase activation. While treatment with AdOX had no effect on apoptosis, protein hypomethylation significantly increases the induction of cell death by DAL-1/4.1B (Figure 4B). This suggests that the modulation of protein methylation may be an important mechanism of DAL-1/4.1B-induced apoptosis.Discussion Apoptosis is traditionally characterized by a series of morphological features such as chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and the appearance of membrane-enclosed apoptotic bodies. Many proteins, including the caspase family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, have been reported to play a pivotal role in the apoptotic process [28-31]. However, caspase-independent pathways are emerging [32]. It has been shown previously that expression of the tumor suppressor DAL-1/4.1B can induce apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells [3] but the mechanism(s) involved have not yet been identified. More recently, it was reported that DAL-1/4.1B interacts with members of the protein arginine N-methyltransferase family (PRMTs) and modulates the posttranslational methylation of cellular substrates. In addition, it was determined that DAL-1/4.1B was not itself a substrate for this post-translational arginine methylation [12]. In this report, we examined the caspase-dependence of DAL-1/4.1B-induced apoptosis and the effect of inhibiting protein methylation on this cell death in MCF-7 cells, to determine if post-translational protein methylation is one potential mechanism through which DAL-1/4.1B exerts its growth suppressive properties. Previously [3] and in this report, induction of DAL-1/4.1B expression was shown to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Examination of a series of caspases revealed that these apoptotic events occurred without activation of the three major effector caspases (caspases 3, 6 and 7) but did result in a significant increase in caspase 8 (p = 0.007) activation. The addition of the caspase 8-specific inhibitor z-VAD-FMK blocked the ability of DAL-1/4.1B to stimulate apoptosis in these cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, restoration of caspase 3 expression did not increase the measured levels of apoptosis following DAL-1/4.1B expression demonstrating that this caspase is not activated even when present. However, restoration of caspase-3 expression was recently shown to sensitize MCF-7 cells to radiation-induced apoptosis exhibiting the hallmarks of a traditional effector caspase activation pathway [33]. Our results suggest that cell death induced by DAL-1/4.1B expression does not proceed via a classic caspase activation cascade, but rather relies solely on one caspase, caspase 8. This lack of effector caspase activation in DAL-1/4.1B-induced apoptosis is intriguing. Activation of these caspases is one of the major characteristics in the programmed cell death process [34]. However, some cells survive caspase activation, and accumulating evidence suggests that many caspase-activating apoptotic stimuli, including oncogenes, p53, DNA-damaging drugs, proapoptotic Bcl2- family members, cytotoxic lymphocytes, and in some cases even death receptors, do not necessarily require activation of the known effector caspases for programmed cell death to occur [35]. Activation of upstream caspases such as caspase 8 has been reported in both mitochondrial-independent and -dependent pathways [36-39]. Activated caspase 8 has been reported to trigger cell death by activating either effector caspases 3, 6 or 7, or DNA damage enzymes such as endonuclease G and AIF. Caspase-induced release of EndoG from mitochondria results in cell apoptosis. Li and colleagues [26] reported apoptosis with activated caspase 8 without activation of effector caspases. A parallel condition – activated caspase 8 without activation of caspases 3, 6, or 7 – occurs when DAL-1/4.1B protein is expressed in MCF-7 cells although preliminary studies did not show the release of EndoG into the cytoplasm (data not shown). Caspase-8 can also cross talk with calpain-dependent apoptotic pathways. Benjamin and colleagues found that both caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD and calpain inhibitors can protect mature mouse oligodendrocytes from cell death initiated by staurosporine, thapsigargin and kainite [40]. Their results suggest that crosstalk occurs between the caspase and calpain pathways, upstream of an irreversible cascade leading to cell death in mature oligodendrocytes. The cross-talk between caspase 8 and calpain has also been identified in vascular smooth muscle cells during Fas-associated apoptosis [41]. DAL-1/4.1B could also induce apoptosis through membrane protein proteases such as calpains. A related 4.1 family tumor suppressor, NF2, has been shown to interact with calpains in neurofibromatosis-related tumors [42]. In the case of the NF2 tumors, some patients lacking functional mutations in the NF2 gene have concomitant overactive calpain protease activity, which effectively degrades the existing NF2 protein, creating a "loss of tumor suppressor protein"-equivalent environment. The potential relationship between DAL-1/4.1B and calpains and their relationship to apoptosis is important to examine further. Although protein methylation has been shown to be involved in such cellular processes as signal transduction and transcription [43] no evidence connecting protein methylation and apoptosis has been reported previously. AdOX, an inhibitor of s-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase, can inhibit methylation by elevating the cellular level of AdoHcy to inhibit the activity of methyltransferases [44]. As AdoHcy is a general inhibitor of the once carbon metabolism pathway, its elevation could also inhibit DNA as well as RNA methylation events. Hypomethylation of cellular methyl-accepting protein substrates by AdOX has been demonstrated previously [44-49] and confirmed in this study (Figure 4A). Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells treated with 30 μM AdOX for 72 hours were found to undergo a 50% decrease in growth rate [44]. In the present analysis, apoptosis levels in MCF-7 cells were not affected by the hypomethylating treatment of cells with 30 μM AdOX for 48 hours. However, AdOX treatment appeared to enhance apoptosis when the DAL-1/4.1B protein was expressed in MCF-7 cells. RNA methylation has also been shown to be altered by AdOX treatment [50] and such methylation could regulate protein synthesis [51-53]. DAL-1/4.1B has previously been shown not to be a substrate for PRMT3- (Singh et al., 2004) or PRMT5-mediated (Jiang et al., 2005) arginine methylation but no information is currently available as to the presence of methylated DAL-1/4.1B mRNA species. Further investigation into the relationship between DAL-1/4.1B, protein methylation and apoptosis is required to determine the exact mechanism(s) by which tumor cell growth and apoptosis are regulated by these proteins. The determination that caspase 8 activation occurs in the absence of effector caspase activation suggests a potentially novel pathway combining aspects of both traditional caspase-dependent cell death and the emerging effector caspase-independent pathways of apoptosis. Furthermore, the interaction between a tumor suppressor (DAL-1/4.1B) and a post-translational methylation enzyme (PRMTs) is likely to be an important modulator of this pathway and so be of significant biological importance in controlling tumorigenesis in breast cancer cells.Conclusion In this report, caspase 8-specific activation by the tumor suppressor DAL-1/4.1B is identified in the absence of activation of effector caspases 3, 6, or 7, suggesting a potentially novel apoptotic pathway combining aspects of both traditional caspase-dependent cell death and the emerging effector caspase-independent pathways of apoptosis. Second it is shown that there is cooperation between DAL-1/4.1B and post-translational protein methylation in the induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. This suggests that the previously published interaction between the tumor suppressor DAL-1/4.1B and the post-translational methylation enzymes (PRMTs) is likely to be an important modulator of this apoptotic pathway and so be of significant biological importance in controlling tumorigenesis in breast cancer cells.MethodsCell culture MCF-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in MEM with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS), sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids and insulin. The MCF-7 Cl27 cell line is a DAL/4.1B-inducible cell line generated from the parental MCF-7 cell line using the Ecdysone Muristerone-inducible Expression Kit (InVitrogen) [3]. DAL-1/4.1B expression is induced by the addition of 2 μM Muristerone to the culture medium for 48 hours. Hypomethylation of cells was carried out by addition of 30 μM AdOX (adenosine, periodate oxidized; Sigma) to the culture medium for 48 hours. A positive control for apoptotic cells was obtained by incubating cells in 1 μM Staurosporine (STS, Sigma) for 4 hours.Western blot Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40) with protease inhibitors (Roche). Electrophoresis was performed on 10% SDS-PAGE gel (BioRad) and transferred onto PVDF plus membrane (MSI Inc) using the BioRad mini Protean II transfer system as previously described [1]. PARP antibody (Cell Signaling) was used at a 1:1000 dilution for the assessment of caspase 7 activation. Inhibition of protein methylation by AdOX treatment was determined using the anti-asymmetric arginine methylation antibody ASYM24 (Upstate Biotech) at a 1:1000 dilution. Detection was performed using the ECL Plus Western Detection Reagents (Amersham).FACS analysis MCF-7 Cl27 cells were treated with 2 μM muristerone A with or without the addition of 30 μM AdOX for 48 hours prior to FACS analysis. For DAL-1/4.1B protein level determinations, cells were collected following trypsinization with 10 mM EDTA/1× PBS followed by two 1× washes in PBS. All procedures were performed on ice. Resuspended cells were then washed twice in 1× Staining buffer (1× PBS containing 2% FCS, 1% human serum, 10 mM HEPES, and 0.025% sodium azide) and collected by centrifugation at 200 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Cells were then fixed in 0.25% paraformaldehyde in 1× staining buffer on ice for 30 minutes to 60 minutes. The buffer was then replaced and cells permeablized in 0.2% Tween-20/1XPBS at 37°C for 15 minutes after which 50 μl of human serum was added to resuspend the cells. Primary antibody (50 μl, rabbit polyclonal anti-DAL-1/4.1B antibody diluted 1:50) was added and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed twice in 0.2% Tween-20/1XPBS buffer. Secondary antibody (phycoerythrin conjugate anti-rabbit IgG H+L (Vector) was added on ice in the dark for 20 minutes followed by two washes in 0.2% Tween-20/1XPBS buffer. Cells were then analyzed on the FAC Calibur system (Becton Dickinson). Apoptosis levels were assessed by Annexin-V (BD Bioscience) and TUNEL (Roche) assays following manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, cells were trypsinized in 10 mM EDTA/1XPBS and approximately 5 × 104 MCF-7 Cl27 cells were cultured in 500 μl medium in a 24 well plate overnight prior to the addition of 2 μM muristerone with or without 30 μM AdOX. Fresh medium was added and cells were grown for 48 hours before measurement of apoptosis levels. For cells treated with staurosporine (STS), approximately 1 × 105 cells were treated with 1 μM STS for 4 hours. Caspase activation was analyzed using Carboxyfluorescein Caspase Detection Kits – FAM-VAD-FMK #FAM100 (Global Caspase), FAM-YVAD-FMK #FMK 600 (Caspase 1), FAM-VDVAD-FMK #FMK700 (Caspase 2), FAM-VEID-FMK #FAM500 (Caspase 6), FAM-LETD-FMK #FAM300 (Caspase 8), and FAM-LEHD-FMK #FAM400 (Caspase 9) from Cell Technology, and FAM-AEVD-FMK (Caspase 10) and FAM-LEED-FMK (Caspase 13) from Immunochemistry Technology, LLC. APO LOGIX Carboxyfluoroscein Caspase Detection Kits label active caspases in living cells undergoing apoptosis. For caspase activation assays, cells were plated as described above after which 20 ml of 30× caspase solution was added. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 1.5 hours in the dark. The medium of each sample was then collected by centrifugation at 200 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Remaining attached cells were washed with 1× washing buffer and added to the non-adherent cell pellets. Attached cells were then detached by treatment with 0.01 M EDTA/1× PBS and all cell solutions combined for analysis on the FAC Calibur system. Caspase 8 inhibition and the effect on apoptosis levels with and without expression of DAL-1/4.1B protein were examined using the caspase 8-specific inhibitor z-IETD-FMK (Calbiochem). MCF7 Cl27-inducible cells were incubated with 0 mM, 15 μM, or 50 μM of inhibitor for one hour prior to the induction of DAL-1/4.1B protein expression and subsequent measurement of apoptosis by Annexin V staining after 48 hours.List of abbreviations AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; AdOX, adenosine dialdehyde; DAL-1, differentially-expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorting; FCS, Fetal calf serum; FERM, 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin domain; NF2, neurofibromatosis 2; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; PRMT, protein arginine N-methyltransferase; SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; STS, staurosporine.Authors' contributions Wei Jiang Ph.D. carried out the experiments described in this article and contributed to the design and analysis of the data as well as the preparation of data for publication.

Introduction Prion diseases, or Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs), are invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases associated with the conversion of the normal host cellular prion protein (PrPc) into the abnormal protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc) [1]. They occur in a wide range of host species including humans, the most common of which is sporadic CJD (sCJD), occurring at a rate of approximately 1 case per million a year worldwide and accounts for greater than 80% of CJD cases [2]. Amino acid changes, which include point or insertional mutations in the normal (cellular) prion protein (PrPC) encoded by the PRNP gene, are linked to genetic prion diseases such as Gerstmann-Strausler-Sheinker (GSS) disease, fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and genetically associated Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Acquired forms of disease are caused by ingestion of, or exposure to, contaminated biological material via food or during medical procedures. Kuru, found amongst the Fore tribe in Papua-New Guinea, was the first known human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy and resulted from exposure to infected material during ritualistic cannibalism. More recently a new human prion disease has emerged, variant CJD (vCJD), which is associated with exposure to the BSE agent in beef. Cases of iatrogenic transmission have also occurred through the use of improperly sterilized surgical instruments, the use of human growth hormone derived from cadaveric pituitaries, and transplantation of corneas and dura mater from infected patients [3]. Recently, human-to-human transmission of vCJD has been reported through blood transfusion [4]; human-adapted prions are more readily transmitted from human to human via this route than via ingestion of BSE prions from contaminated meat products [5]. Animals affected by TSEs include sheep (Scrapie), cattle (BSE) and mule, deer, elk (CWD). The impact of animal TSEs is twofold; firstly, there is a risk of transmission to humans, and secondly, the economic impact on animal production has been substantial. Although scrapie has been endemic for hundreds of years in many parts of the world its transmission to humans has never been reported. However, when vCJD in humans was determined to be associated with consumption of contaminated food there was concern as to what extent the population has been exposed. In the recent years, the incidence of CWD has increased markedly within North America and although it has not been linked to CJD either epidemiologically, or by laboratory confirmation, there is concern about the possibility for cross-species transmission [6, 7]. TSEs in animals have caused huge economic loses. Since the BSE epidemic began in 1986, millions of cattle have been slaughtered and bans on the importation of beef have affected many countries and cost billions of dollars. The threat posed to public health by dietary and medical exposure to prions has driven tremendous efforts to develop sensitive methods of detection of prions to control the spread of human and animal TSEs. All the commercially available diagnostic tests for TSEs rely on the direct detection of the proteinase K resistant, misfolded form (PrPSc) of cellular prion protein in the central nervous system (CNS). Although methodologies are sensitive and specific for postmortem diagnosis, the use of PrPSc as a preclinical or general biomarker for surveillance is difficult, due to the fact that it is present in extremely small amounts in accessible tissues or body fluids such as blood, urine, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Recently, amplification techniques have been developed which have enabled increased sensitivity. These are based on the ability of the disease-related abnormal isoform, PrPSc, to convert a pool of normal PrPC to a proteinase K resistant form thus “amplifying” the original infectious seed. Amplification can be increased by breaking down the resulting aggregated seeds of PrPSc to smaller units which in turn act as seeds for further replication until levels of PrPSc detectable by Western blot or ELISA are produced. These developments may provide the sensitivity necessary for a blood or food screening test useful for some of the transmissible TSEs. However, it has recently been reported that proteinase K sensitive, pathological isoforms of PrP may have a significant role in the pathogenesis of some prion diseases [8]. Novel PrPSc isoforms with unique biochemical properties may be generated in sporadic or acquired disease that exhibit increased sensitivity to PK digestion. Therefore, conventional tests may show significant discordance between the amounts of PrPSc detected and the infectivity observed. Accordingly, the development of new diagnostic tests that do not rely on PK digestion is desirable. Another challenge for diagnosis and surveillance is that hosts can incubate infectious prion agents for many months or years, during which time they exhibit no overt symptoms. Incubation periods for some human prion diseases can be as long as 40 years and given the recent cases of vCJD transmitted by blood transfusion the need for development of a test for screening blood has increased. Furthermore, a noninvasive test to identify the early stages of CJD would be valuable in the development of treatment strategies for TSEs. A biomarker is defined as a discriminative feature that can be measured objectively and used as an indicator of biological processes such as normal health, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic treatment. Biomarkers include physical traits such as temperature or blood pressure, imaging of pathological features such as amyloid deposition or ventricular volume changes in the brain, and the presence of biological molecules in tissues and body fluids such as blood or urine. One aim of biomarker discovery is the detection of molecular correlates of disease that can be used as early diagnostic tools. However, this type of marker has a crucial requirement for high sensitivity and specificity. Few markers of this type have emerged from omics studies, not only for prion diseases but also for the multitude of other diseases that have been investigated. Biomarkers with broad specificity for neurodegeneration (not only in TSEs) may also be useful as general indicators of disease pathology; identification of biomarkers to follow the progression of disease would significantly impact the time and cost required to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The search for biomarkers (other than PrPSc) as tools for diagnosis of prion diseases has a long history; in fact there are several protein markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are useful for diagnosis of human prion diseases. In 1980, two proteins were identified by 2D electrophoresis in the CSF of sporadic CJD patients. One of these, a 30 kDa polypeptide, was identified as a member of the 14-3-3 family of proteins, a normal neuronal protein that is released into the CSF after neuronal insult. The CSF detection of 14-3-3 protein by Western blot is widely used as diagnostic evidence of CJD, in conjunction with clinical indicators of prion disease [9]. The detection of 14-3-3 in CSF is a highly sensitive marker for sCJD, iCJD, and the genetic form of CJD, however, is much less sensitive for diagnosis of vCJD, GSS, and FFI [10]. A number of other proteins are also increased in the CSF of CJD patients including Tau and phospho-Tau, S-100ß, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Levels of the tau protein are raised in patients affected by all forms of CJD including vCJD. A recent study determined that the detection of tau in CSF has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 94% for vCJD, higher than any of the other markers tested. Testing for the presence of multiple markers, 14-3-3 protein in CSF plus tau, results in the highest sensitivity for the use of these biomarkers in diagnosis of human TSEs [11]. These CSF biomarkers have proven to be extremely useful in confirmatory diagnostics of CJD cases, and their widespread use illustrates an important role for surrogate marker detection in prion disease. They do not, however, have comprehensive value for surveillance of transmitted TSEs and are useful only when the disease is already at an advanced state. Ideally biomarkers able to detect all TSEs even at preclinical stages of infection are desirable. This paper will focus on recent efforts to harness the plethora of omic technologies to identify not only potentially diagnostic biomarkers, but also markers to follow disease progression or which have risk determining potential.2. Tools for Biomarker Identification in TSEs In the last few years technologies to study all the genes and proteins expressed in an organism or cells simultaneously have become accessible for most laboratories, and these provide a platform for biomarker discovery. Experimental strategies to detect biomarkers generally involve comparisons of mRNA, protein, peptide, and metabolite abundances between samples collected from infected versus control tissues. The most commonly used technologies are described here, followed by discussion of approaches that are being used in the identification of useful biomarkers in relation to prion disease, as well as potential directions for future research.2.1. Differentially Expressed mRNA Biomarkers High-throughput genomic techniques, most commonly DNA microarrays and subtractive hybridization approaches, are the most frequently reported methodologies used for the identification of deregulated genes in tissues and cells [12]. These expression profiles, or “signatures,” can themselves be used grossly as biomarkers, are relatively easy to generate, and the techniques can be readily adapted to high throughput. Signatures can be compared across multiple time points, tissues, or experimental populations to look for molecules predictive of disease. With the advent of ultra-high-throughput sequencing technologies, researchers are increasingly turning to deep sequencing for gene expression studies [13–15]. Advantages over microarray approaches are that different variants or “isoforms” of mRNA generated by differential splicing, alternative termination, and alternative transcriptional start sites are all identified. Additionally, these methodologies are also well suited for the identification and profiling of small RNAs, such as miRNAs, which are increasingly thought to play important roles in neurodegenerative diseases and may be useful biomarkers [16]. One recent innovation that has been applied to high-throughput sequencing is the purification of RNA from ribosome complexes prior to deep sequencing to capture those templates actively undergoing translation. This method has been found to be more reflective of protein abundance than are traditional microarray or sequenced mRNA profiles and may improve the ability to infer protein biomarkers from RNA profiles [17]. Changes in mRNA profiles in brain tissue from CJD patients are infrequently studied due to the rarity of cases. Only one report has been published using tissues isolated from the postmortem brain samples of sporadic CJD patients; transcriptional changes pointed to alterations in neuronal dysfunction pathways including the cell cycle, cell death, and the stress response [18]. A number of genomic analyses of brain tissue from rodent adapted models of prion diseases including CJD, scrapie and BSE have been performed, as well as investigation of samples from larger animals, sheep infected with scrapie and cattle infected with BSE [19–27]. These studies have revealed widespread alterations of multiple cellular pathways correlating with the onset of pathological disease including cholesterol homeostasis, ion homeostasis, and regulation of apoptosis, stress response, and metal ion homeostasis. The most consistent finding between experimental models, relates to the onset of neuroinflammation, a process common to many neurodegenerative diseases that is likely induced by damage and death of neurons. Accordingly, many of these transcriptional changes have been consistently identified in multiple neurodegenerative diseases and a selection of these is listed in Table 1. Although differential expression of these genes may not be specific to prion diseases, neuroinflammation-related gene expression may be an excellent choice as candidate biomarkers to track the stage of development of the neurodegenerative process and to predict the response to therapy. Studies to correlate the temporal changes in neuronal health during disease have not yet been reported in prion-infected neurons; however, hippocampal neurons from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have revealed a transcriptional response comprising thousands of genes that significantly correlates with AD markers [31, 32]. It is possible that at least in part, these biological processes may be common to degenerating neurons in multiple degenerative conditions. In this case these biomarkers may well be broadly applicable to track the progression of neurodegeneration. As the vast majority of human samples are collected postmortem, animal models may be the only practical way of assessing early markers of neuronal status prior to obvious clinical symptoms. A number of studies have attempted to use genomics to determine transcriptional changes at preclinical stages of disease; however, due to the cellular complexity of brain tissue only modest fold changes are revealed. Subtle alterations occurring in a small number of neurons at the onset of disease are likely masked. To get the best results from this type of study it is essential to use large sample numbers for statistical significance. Neuron specific expression changes may be masked even at late stages of disease by the extensive astrocytosis and gliosis that accompany neuronal degeneration. Neurons, and therefore their genetic material, are outnumbered 10 or 20 to 1. Laser capture microdissection to excise specific cell populations is set to overcome many of the limitations of whole tissue analysis and will undoubtedly provide a new “layer” of information regarding specific cellular responses to prion replication.2.2. Differentially Expressed Protein Biomarkers Protein biomarkers are particularly well suited for measuring and detecting phenotypic characteristics of disease processes. Proteomic technologies enable the exhaustive analysis of the protein content of a tissue or bodily fluid sample. Only in the recent years has technological advances facilitated the differential measurement of protein abundance levels between multiple conditions at a given time, and just as importantly, provided sufficient “through-put” to attach statistical significance to protein biomarker detection. Proteomics of prion infected tissues also suffer from some of the same drawbacks of genomics studies; samples are often very heterogeneous due to cellular complexity and the stage of disease. One of the major caveats of proteomics for prion disease discovery is that the commonly used rodent models provide very small sample volumes, especially in terms of bodily fluids such as blood, from which only the most abundant proteins can be identified. The laser capture microdissection techniques hold much promise for genomic studies to reduce cell heterogeneity as the small amounts of nucleic acid can be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, proteins cannot be amplified and ultra-sensitive techniques must be developed in order to perform similar proteomic studies. New techniques for labelling small amounts of protein such as fluorescence saturation labelling may be one step in the right direction to overcome these limitations. This technique has enabled proteomic analysis of hippocampal CA1 neurons in an Alzheimer's mouse model; however identification of such small amounts of protein requires increased sensitivity of mass spectrometry techniques [33]. Given these problems and the scarcity of samples from large animal models and human TSE cases, it is not surprising that only a very small number of prion-related proteomic studies have been reported. Table 2 provides a general summary of these, and some examples from similar studies of neurodegenerative diseases with similar aetiologies as proof of principle. Current methodologies for proteomics follow two principal steps. Firstly proteins are separated to provide a sample with decreased complexity and then mass spectrometry (MS) is used for protein identification. Separation techniques include surface-enhanced laser desorption ionizing time of flight (SELDI-TOF), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-GE) and the recently developed two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) for differential protein analysis, and liquid chromatography (LC). All of these methodologies are not inherently quantitative but have been adapted to allow the user to identify qualitative changes between samples, for example, differential abundances of proteins between diseased and control tissues. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionizing time of flight (SELDI-TOF) is a mass spectrometry technique that is based on a combination of techniques, chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) [44]. In the first step of SELDI-TOF MS proteins are captured using different platform chemistries such as absorption, electrostatic interaction, and affinity chromatography which reduce the complexity of the original sample. This happens on a small “protein-chip” surface which enables multiple separations to be performed on very small sample volumes at high throughput. Following this, the bound proteins are cocrystallized with an energy absorbing matrix (EAM) which is then vaporized propelling the ionized proteins down the flight tube through an electric field based upon the particles mass/charge (m/z) ratio. Contact of complexes with the detector at the end of the flight tube results in a unique peak resolved by m/z ratio of the original protein or protein isoform. The advantages of this method are the ability to perform high-throughput analysis of hundreds or thousands of samples, resolving power of the captured proteins, and the ease of analysis using dedicated user friendly software. However, protein peaks of interest must be experimentally isolated for identification using peptide mass fingerprinting along with protein purification techniques. This step requires much larger sample volumes than used in the initial discovery stage and can be arduous and time-consuming. In 2D gel electrophoresis separation of proteins is performed in a polyacrylamide gel according to their size and their charge thus enabling resolution of multiple isoforms of an individual protein. The spot intensities can be used to calculate differences in protein abundance between different samples and individual protein spots can then be excised from the gel and identified using MS. Practical issues such as variations in sample preparation make it very difficult to get consistently reproducible gels making this methodology labour intensive. Recent adaptations to this methodology have improved the situation somewhat, with the most significant innovation being labelling of samples using fluorescence dyes (2D-DIGE). In this way it is possible to include three samples per gel, control and infected samples plus an internal standard (pooled samples). This creates a standard for each protein in the analysis resulting in the user being able to make comparisons across different gels with a high degree of confidence [45]. In LC the sample components interact to a varying extent with a chromatographic packing material in a column (stationary phase). A pump moves the mobile phase through the column, and the sample is separated based on a retention time through the column which varies depending on the interactions between the stationary phase, the molecules being analyzed, and the solvent used. Generally protein samples are enzymatically digested prior to loading on the column. This differs from both SELDI and 2D-GE in which it is generally intact proteins that are separated. In one dimension the peptide mixtures are generally too complex to separate; however, in combination with chromatography or 2D gel electrophoresis the methodology provides a means to perform large-scale proteomic analysis with good dynamic range. Labelling of peptides with isotopes enables this methodology to be used to identify the differential abundance of peptides between samples. To do this a stable isotope is used to label peptides. The labelled peptide is chemically identical to its native counterpart, so it behaves in an identical fashion during chromatographic separation, however it is distinguishable by MS, therefore variation in abundance between a tagged and untagged sample can be determined. A number of approaches using this methodology have been described including Isotope Coded Affinity Tagging (ICAT) and the recently described Isobaric Tagging for Relative and Absolute Protein Quantification (iTRAQ) quantitative proteomic approach [46]. iTRAQ is ideally suited for biomarker applications, as it provides both quantification and allows some degree of multiplexing in a single reagent. The isotopic tag can be incorporated either during sample labelling or in vivo (stable isotope labelling, SILAC), further increasing its scope [47]. MS to identify the mass/charge ratio of the peptide/protein of interest or to determine the primary sequence of the peptide is the final step in all proteomic approaches. This step involves ionization of the sample; MALDI and electrospray ionization (ESI) are the most commonly used technologies for this. In MALDI the sample is mixed with a matrix, applied to a target surface and inserted into a vacuum chamber and a laser is used to activate sample ionization. In ESI the sample is dissolved in a solvent and pumped through a narrow, stainless steel capillary. A high voltage is applied to the tip of the capillary, which is situated within the ionisation source of the mass spectrometer, and as a consequence of this strong electric field, the sample emerging from the tip is dispersed into an aerosol of highly charged droplets. A gas, usually nitrogen, helps this process and directs the spray emerging from the capillary tip towards the mass spectrometer. The ionized sample is generally resolved based on the m/z ratio in a time-of-flight (TOF) analyser. However, a number of choices for ion sources are available and these can be combined with different spectrometers. One promising innovation is fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS), a popular tool for discovery due to its high resolving power, mass measurement accuracy, multistage MS/MS potential, and extended dynamic range [48]. When accompanied by 1D or 2D electrophoresis, FTMS has demonstrated an excellent ability to deal with sample complexity for biomarker discovery [49]. One further innovative method sometimes used in biomarker discovery is the antibody microarray, the proteomic equivalent of gene microarrays. In these arrays specific antibodies are spotted onto glass or membranes, or bound to beads in fluidic arrays. Target proteins are then captured from samples of plasma or disrupted tissue and detected using an ELISA type approach using labelled secondary antibodies. The use of these arrays has not been described in prion disease; however a study to screen the abundance of 120 signalling proteins in plasma from Alzheimer's patients was recently reported. A total of 259 samples were analysed with the antibody panel, and 18 proteins were identified as potential biomarkers. These proteins were used to classify blinded samples from Alzheimer's and control subjects with close to 90% accuracy as well as identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment that progressed to Alzheimer's disease 2–6 years later. The 18 proteins are involved in biological processes known to be disrupted in neurodegeneration including deregulation of haematopoiesis, immune responses, apoptosis and neuronal support [50].3. Searching the Body for Prion Related Biomarkers The complexity of prion-induced neurodegenerative diseases along with their unique molecular mechanisms poses huge challenges to understand their biology and to identify antemortem biomarkers. In addition the diseases are aetiologically heterogeneous. Prion diseases are unique in that they can occur in one of three ways, spontaneously, via genetic changes, or acquired through oral or iatrogenic transmission of the infectious agent. Spontaneous or genetic forms of the disease arise and progress solely in the brain, with minimal to no agent replication in the periphery. Only in the case of a TSE transmitted by digestion or blood transfusion, such as in vCJD, does the initial replication of the agent take place in the periphery. Implications of these aetiologies are that diagnostic biomarkers, especially for preclinical stages of disease, will unlikely encompass all forms of prion disease. Prions acquired from different sources, strains, or different genetic origins present with differing symptoms, incubation periods, and pathobiological features will result in ambiguities in biomarker detection. Accordingly, the tissues and bodily fluids chosen for biomarker selection need to be tailored to the TSE under study and the specific aim of biomarker selection. For example, blood or lymphoid tissue may be the sample of choice for selection of a preclinical marker of vCJD infection, brain tissue for indicators of prognosis, and blood or urine to follow disease progression or perhaps to identify individuals more susceptible to disease or particular treatments. While specificity to prion disease would be a requirement for identifying preclinical cases or screening donated blood, for example, progression of disease could be followed using markers of broader specificity such as indicators of CNS damage and neuronal death. To further complicate the selection of biomarkers in prion disease the long incubation period prior to development of clinical symptoms, from many months to many years, may well result in temporal differences in marker expression. Therefore disease stage, as well as target tissue, needs to be taken into account when deciding on a sampling strategy and evaluating biomarkers. The greatest public health risk accompanies those TSEs that can be transmitted in food, medical products, and blood such as vCJD or any future novel outbreaks. A closer look at prion pathogenesis in these instances may lead to the identification of appropriate tissues and body fluids for early detection of prion diseases. A summary of these potential tissues and body fluids is given in Figure 1(a). In Figure 1(b) a schema illustrating the incubation period of a typical TSE indicating disease stages optimal for identification of biomarkers for different purposes is provided. In the next section we describe some of these tissues and bodily fluids that are potential reservoirs for biomarkers in more detail, and review related biomarker studies.3.1. Biomarkers in Lymphoid Tissues Following ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs, PrPSc must be transported from the gut to the brain. Current data suggests that PrPSc crosses the gut epithelium, possibly through M cells, and rapidly accumulates in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs), mainly in the mesenteric lymph nodes, and then in the spleen early in the preclinical phase prior to neuroinvasion. Two studies of gene expression changes have been described using tissue from infected and control Peyers patches. In the first samples from cattle orally infected with BSE revealed 90 genes and 16 ESTs to be differentially expressed. Of these genes, five were found to be related to immune function. These were major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, MHC class II DQ alpha, L-RAP, and two hypothetical proteins. Other differentially expressed genes identified related to cellular and metabolic processes including the development and maturation of cells [51]. In the second study the mRNA level of a pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP)-like protein was found to be elevated in the ileal Peyer's patch of lambs during the early phase of scrapie infection [52]. Although the first study tissue analysed was 12 months following oral inoculation Peyers Patches may be sources of very early disease specific markers. In B cell follicles, PrPSc is detected on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) networks and macrophages within germinal centres (GCs) [53–55] of the spleen and lymph nodes. Although prion infection still occurs in the absence of FDCs, the infection is severely delayed suggesting that FDCs are significant cellular sites of peripheral replication [53, 56, 57]. The lymphoinvasion step is an appealing point in the disease process for the identification of biomarkers as it occurs prior to neuroinvasion in those TSEs with ingestion aetiologies and is thus the optimal time point for early diagnosis or therapeutic intervention [58]. In addition lymphoid tissues are also more accessible than brain tissue for sampling purposes. Despite this, very few studies describing gene or protein biomarkers associated with prion replication in spleen or lymph nodes have been published. A recent study has identified changes in the expression of St6gal1, St3gal5, Man2a1, Hexb, Pigq, glycosylation-related genes, in the spleens of scrapie infected mice [59]. The authors suggest that this indicates modification of the splenic metabolism of glycosphingolipids associated with prion disease. FDCs themselves express high levels of PrPC and are able to retain antigens for relatively long periods of time, including replicating PrPSc, making them good cell candidates for the identification of biomarkers. However, FDCs make up less than 1% of the total cells within the spleen or lymph node which likely means that most disease associated expression changes are masked when looking at whole tissues. They are also tightly associated with other cell types, especially B cells, which along with the gap in knowledge regarding their lineage and molecular characteristics make them difficult to isolate for independent analysis. One study, however, has shown an increase in clusterin expression in association with abnormal PrP accumulation expression on FDCs during TSE disease, particularly human vCJD cases [60]. Lymph fluid passes through lymph nodes and contains a mixture of proteins and antigens picked up from the interstitial tissues which it drains; it therefore reflects changes associated with any immunoinflammatory response within the node itself. The protein composition therefore emulates that of blood as well as being highly reflective of the host response to mucosal challenge. Given the route of transmission of acquired prion infections following ingestion and the subsequent preclinical replication in lymph nodes, lymph fluid may be an excellent, as yet untested source, from which biomarkers that accompany preclinical prion disease progression can be identified. In the human genetic and sporadic forms of prion diseases, the disease occurs spontaneously within brain tissue and there is no preliminary involvement of peripheral tissues, and so FDCs and macrophages do not play a role in disease pathogenesis. Indeed PrPSc is most often absent in the lymphoid tissues, although, secondary infection of lymph nodes can occur in some instances, as recent studies show that PrPSc can be detected in spleens of patients with sCJD [61]. Biomarkers specifically expressed in lymphoid tissue or FDCs would therefore be useful for the detection of TSEs acquired specifically by peripheral exposure.3.2. Biomarkers in CSF Following neuroinvasion and establishment of prion disease in the brain of transmitted TSEs and following the onset of sporadic or genetic forms of disease, the CSF has been the tissue of choice for diagnosis and biomarker identification, due to its obvious association with the CNS and the fact that it is somewhat more accessible than CNS tissue itself. CSF is ideal for use in protein and gene expression profiling techniques to identify biomarkers both to track progression of neurodegeneration, as well as having the potential to contain biomarkers specific to prion replication. Studies using 2D gel electrophoresis to profile proteins in CSF have the longest history in biomarker identification for CJD. A number of studies have identified cystatin C, transferrin, ubiquitin, Apoliprotein J, lactate dehydrogenase, 14-3-3 proteins plus other as yet unidentified polypeptides as potential biomarkers [43, 62, 63]. In addition a study employing SELDI-TOF analysis of CSF revealed a 13.4 KDa protein. Further analysis using cationic exchange chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed this protein to be cystatin C. Immunoblotting confirmed the significantly increased abundance of cystatin C in all eight CJD-affected patients included in this preliminary study [64]. Interestingly many, if not all, of the genes mentioned above have also been identified as differentially expressed in brain tissue of rodents infected with prions. A study by Brown et al. also links the levels of differentially expressed genes to protein levels in the CSF, an observation that suggests that candidate gene panels identified from animal studies could be used for prediction of disease-associated CSF biomarkers [30, 65–67]. The detection of biomarkers in the CSF appears promising; however, all of the above-mentioned proteins have been observed to increase in abundance in the brains and/or CSF in other neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or in traumatic brain injury. This finding suggests that the proteins identified to date are not specific markers for prion disease but general biomarkers of neurodegeneration disease or trauma. However, the use patterns of expression of panels of these markers may confer specificity, or alternatively, these markers could well be used as useful indicators of disease progression. Recently, a proof of principle study revealed that the combination of MALDI-FTMS, in addition to machine learning for the classification of mass spectral features, is able to identify preclinical protein signatures from the CSF of prion infected animals with reasonable predicative accuracy [68]. In this study CSF was isolated from 21 infected and 22 control hamsters at a time-point when approximately 80% of the expected incubation period had been completed. CSF was isolated and subjected to trypsin digestion without further fractionation and subjected to MALDI-FTMS, a methodology described earlier in the chapter. Peptide profiles were identified and the peaks compared using IonSpec peak picking software; a number of peptide peaks exhibiting differential abundances were identified. It was reported that these peaks were amongst the least abundant peptides detected in the study, highlighting the need for improved methodologies to target low abundance proteins and peptides in biomarker studies. A linear support vector machines (SVM) and 10-fold leave-one-out cross validation was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the peptide peaks showing the greatest differences in abundance between infected and non-infected hamsters. The predictive accuracy was determined to be 72%; true positive rate of 73% and false positive rate of 27% using a 10-fold leave-one-out cross validation demonstrated a potential for the use of proteomic profiling of CSF for the identification of multiple biomarkers with diagnostic value. However, the identity of these peptides was not resolved in this study. Although specificity was fairly low, as mentioned by Herbst et al. a disease-specific protein signature clearly exists in the CSF. This type of approach combined with a prefractionation step to improve the accuracy of biomarker detection in the range of low abundance proteins could well result in identification of a panel of markers with diagnostic potential. In this case the small size of hamsters and small volumes of CSF precludes this approach so larger animal models or human samples would be required. The comparison of protein profiles with other forms of neurodegenerative disorders would be the next step in increasing specificity to prion diseases.3.3. Biomarkers in Blood Blood is the ideal reservoir for markers indicative of the progression of disease processes in the body, samples are easy to obtain and noninvasive to the patient, and as it circulates throughout the whole body, is a repository for biomarkers of general health and disease. Although no secondary transmission of the sporadic or genetic forms of CJD has been reported, secondary transmission of vCJD from “human-to-human” can occur via blood transfusion. The infectious agent itself is present in the blood in this instance probably following replication in peripheral lymphoid tissue. An in vitro test to detect vCJD prion contamination in human blood or blood products is therefore one of the priorities for the development of sensitive and specific tests. Diagnostic signatures of BSE have been identified in serum of infected cattle by multivariate analysis of infrared spectra, at a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 90%, strongly supporting the hypothesis that infection with prion agents leads to specific changes in the molecular content of serum [69]. However, no predictive tests for CJD or other prion disease have yet been validated in blood, including detection of the prion specific biomarker PrPSc. A number of studies have identified differential abundances of a handful of proteins in the blood of patients with CJD. One study has shown an increase of the S-100ß protein and another, an increase in cystatin C [70]. Another recent study found elevated levels of heart fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) in the serum of patients with CJD [42]. Fatty acid binding proteins are located within the cell and are responsible for the shuttling of fatty acids in the cytosol and are released from the cell in response to cell damage [42]. However, again, high levels of this protein have also been observed in acute myocardial infarctions, in stroke patients, and Alzheimer's patients, implying that this is not a specific prion disease biomarker. An early genomics study using differential display reverse-transcriptase PCR (DDRT-PCR) to determine differentially expressed genes in blood identified lower levels of the erythroid differentiation-related factor (ERAF) in the spleen, bone marrow and blood of scrapie infected mice [71]. The same group also observed differential expression of other erythroid-related genes (KEL, GYPA) in the spleens of infected mice as a common feature of murine scrapie [72]. However, these genes were found to be expressed at highly variable levels between individuals, thus precluding their usefulness as accurate markers for diagnosis. Blood (serum and plasma) is one of the most difficult tissues to analyse using omic technologies. Blood is a highly complex tissue that displays a huge dynamic range of protein abundances challenging the identification of the less abundant species; these rare proteins and peptides likely include the majority of disease specific biomarkers. Prefractionation steps are absolutely necessary to deplete the most abundant proteins [73]. The most common of these are immunodepletion, used extensively for the specific removal of high abundance proteins, based on the action of specific antibodies. More recently, saturation protein binding to a random peptide library has been proposed as an alternative method [38]. Not surprisingly, given these difficulties and the scarcity of samples from CJD patients and large animal models, no proteomic screens for biomarkers of prion disease have been reported to date. Protein profiling of plasma has been reported in a number of studies of Alzheimer's disease and these show some success as evidenced by cross-study reproducibility and validation (albeit fairly low sensitivity and specificity) in patient cohorts. In one study, mass spectrometric analysis of the changes observed in two-dimensional electrophoresis from the plasma of 50 Alzheimers patients and 50 matched controls identified a number of proteins previously implicated in the disease pathology. These included complement factor H (CFH) precursor and alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha-2M). Although the specificity and sensitivity was fairly low, elevation of CFH and alpha-2M was shown to be specific for Alzheimer's disease and to correlate with disease severity [38]. Two other studies also identified these proteins as upregulated in the plasma of Alzhiemers patients; given that prion diseases have similar aetiologies it is likely that plasma may well be a rich source for biomarkers to monitor disease progression, and potentially for use in diagnosis [34, 35, 74]. Blood contains a number of circulating cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and platelets. Another approach in the search for biomarkers is to isolate specific cell populations and use these as a basis for gene or protein profiling studies. Targeting cells that may be involved in prion replication may increase the chance of picking up disease specific changes; however, no such studies have yet been done. Circulating immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells can carry infectious PrPSc and may therefore traffic infectious prion agent around the body. Macrophages have been found to contain PrPSc even in the absence of FDCs, thus leading to the speculation that they might serve as alternative sites of prion accumulation and replication when there are no functional FDCs [56]. Dendritic cells are also mobile cells that can retain endocytosed particles without degradation for long periods of time, therefore ideal candidates for propagating prion proteins throughout the body [75]. Activation of the innate immune system in the brain is a general response during neurodegeneration, including that induced by prions. Studies have identified inflammatory genes that are significantly induced or suppressed in microglia isolated from CJD infected brains and these may be a source for potential candidate markers. In one study the CJD expression profile obtained contrasted with that of uninfected microglia exposed to prototypic inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide and IFN-gamma, as well as PrP amyloid. Transcript profiles unique for microglia and other myeloid cells involved in neurodegeneration provide opportunities for the discovery of disease specfic biomarkers [19]. A second study also describes the expression of a number of potentially neuroprotecive genes in macrophages/microglia from CJD infected patients [76]. The serum levels of immunomarkers may reflect the inflammatory process in the brain so that monitoring the levels of a panel of these in the serum of infected individuals may track the progress of the neurodegenerative process in patients. Whether or not the inflammatory process is reflected in the serum in prion diseases has not been investigated and is an area for further work. However, a number of studies in other diseases support this possibility including the identification of upregulated neuroinflammatory markers in the blood of Parkinson's affected individuals [34, 35] and a study by Ray et al to identify plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease using antibody arrays [48]. These arrays were used to identify 18 plasma protein biomarkers that one able to discriminate Alzheimer's disease with 90% accuracy, the majority of which were immune related cytokines and growth factors. 3.4. Biomarkers in Urine Urine is commonly used for diagnostic testing in many different conditions and being somewhat less complex than serum is amenable to exploratory biomarker analysis. Two recent studies have applied proteomics for the identification of prion-induced biomarkers. In the first study, the urine of infected cattle over the time course of disease was examined using a combination of 2D-DIGE and mass spectrometry analysis [37]. Four classifier proteins were identified, two of these proteins, immunoglobulin Gamma-2 chain C region and clusterin significantly increased in abundance over time. Increase in the abundance of immunoglobulins has also been reported previously in the urine of scrapie-infected hamsters [77]. Levels of an isoform of clusterin were found to predict with 100% accuracy during infection with BSE, however, the study size was extremely small and limited to a single sample group and so requires validation. Clusterin is a multifunctional glycoprotein found ubiquitously expressed throughout the body and is abundant in astrocytes, CSF, and blood plasma [39, 78]. Its expression has been found to increase in the brains of prion infected mice as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases, and on insult to the brain. A recently reported identified clusterin as a blood borne biomarker following plasma profiling in Huntington's disease patients and additionally saw its upregulation in the CSF of affected individuals [79]. These studies suggest clusterin could have general utility as an inflammatory associated marker for multiple conditions including neurodegeneration. In the second study, urinary alpha1-antichymotrypsin was found to be dramatically increased in urine of patients suffering from sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and a number of other animal models of prion disease [36]. Alpha1-antichymotrypsin, like clusterin, has been identified as a potential disease marker in many disparate diseases including the response to renal and other injuries, and deregulation of expression in many cancers and is therefore not specific to TSEs. It is likely that as both clusterin and alpha1-antichymotrypsin levels are highly responsive to multiple diseases and trauma that the levels in a normal population would preclude utility as a diagnostic marker. However, as levels of both clusterin and alpha1-antichymotrypsin were reported to increase incrementally during the course of disease, this type of marker could potentially be used to monitor the progress of degeneration in individuals during treatment.3.5. Exosomes Exosomes have been investigated for their value as “repositories” for biomarker detection. Exosomes are small (50–90 nm) microvesicles that originate in the cell and following release are thought to be able to migrate and interact with or on other cells [80]. They are often released by cells undergoing stress or other stimuli and may therefore act as carriers of potential biomarkers. Additionally, exosomes are easily isolated from multiple biological fluids and have a much less complex protein component than whole blood, serum, CSF or urine; during the formation of intraluminal vesicles in exosomes extensive sorting of proteins and lipids occurs at the membrane of endosomes which results in them containing a specific group of proteins [80]. Recently the presence of both PrPC [81] and PrPSc [82] on exosomes has been demonstrated. In prion infection, exosomes may be ideal candidates for biomarker discovery as they have been reported to be released from several cell types that are involved in prion infection, including intestinal epithelial cells, neurons, neuroglial cells, and DCs. PrPSc is associated with exosomes from neuroglial and epithelial cells and these may provide a means of cell-to-cell transfer of infectious prions [82]. FDCs which are actively involved in peripheral prion replication release significant numbers of exosomes on stimulation and it is possible that these are involved in the extracellular transport of PrPSc to nerve endings, although the mechanism by which prions travel from FDCs to the nervous system is presently unknown. It has, however, been shown that the topographical location between FDCs and nerve endings plays a key role in determining the efficiency of neuroinvasion; the process is accelerated when FDCs are in closer contact with the nerve endings [83]. As exosomes in human plasma may have a multitude of cellular origins including release from human platelets, epithelial cells and hemopoetic cells such as mast cells we believe they could be both a source of biomarkers for early detection of PrPSc in peripheral infection or for the identification of biomarkers specific to prion replication. Alternatively, they may be reservoirs of inflammation- or stress-related biomarkers that could be detected in plasma, CSF or urine. Although these avenues have yet to be explored in prion diseases, other studies to identify exosomal biomarkers provide proof-of-principle, such as the identification of Fetuin-A as a potential biomarker from urine in patients with acute kidney injuries and glioblastoma [84, 85].4. Future Perspectives in Prion Biomarker Research Techniques for protein profiling are rapidly evolving as are techniques for rapid genome scale sequencing for gene expression profiling. Other novel methodologies can be applied to the fractionation and isolation of pertinent cell types from which to isolate more specific markers of prion disease and neurodegenerative processes. One technique that shows promise in this regard is laser-capture microdissection (LCM) capable of isolating individual cells from cut tissue sections, thus allowing identification of RNA and protein changes specifically in prion-replicating cells. These biomarkers may well be too scarce to pick up on examination of whole tissues or body fluids. It is a useful tool for either markers of peripheral infection in cells from the spleen, gut mucosa, and lymphoid tissue such as tonsils, or to identify prion-replication associated markers, or neuronal health related markers in brain tissues which may well translate to markers in CSF or blood. So far LCM biomarker research on prion diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders is in its infancy but is a promising area for future research. A burgeoning area for biomarker research is the identification of dysregulated small noncoding RNAs, especially the recently identified family of microRNAs (miRNAs) which are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in both plants and animals [86]. These short RNAs have been determined to have regulatory roles that are vital to many cellular processes and appear to be particularly active in controlling complex functions in the nervous system such as neurodevelopment and neuronal function. Recently, compelling evidence for the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and prion diseases, has been published [87–89]. Indeed two miRNAs exhibiting increased expression in the brains of rodent models of scrapie were similarly upregulated in the brains of BSE infected macaques illustrating the potential for consistency across species [90]. The potential of miRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis has also been endorsed by studies showing that expression of miRNAs in various cancers can be highly specific and discriminatory profiles between diseased and non-diseased tissues can be readily identified [91].5. Conclusion Significant advances in recent years in technologies for high-throughput sequencing and proteomics mean that the future is bright for biomarker discovery in relation to prion diseases. Of particular note are the ability to obtain transcriptional profiles from homogeneous cell populations at different stages of disease, advances in prefractionation methods for proteomic studies, and the possibility of high-throughput proteomics to identify ever increasing numbers of individual proteins from a single sample. However, a number of unique hurdles and pitfalls remain in relation to prion diseases; these include the very small number of clinical cases for validatory studies, the long incubation period, and the variability of pathogenesis between strains and routes of infection. It is this heterogeneity among prion disease phenotypes that requires careful choice of tissues and time points to use as starting materials for biomarker discovery. Given these factors it may well be impossible to, for example, identify a single preclinical biomarker congruent to the diagnosis of all prion diseases. Conversely, similarities between molecular mechanisms leading to damage and death of neurons in multiple degenerative conditions may allow the broad utility of biomarkers to track disease progression or to predict the onset of disease between prion and other neurodegenerative conditions. Another factor of note that contributes to the relatively slow progress of research in this area relates to the physical properties of the agent itself. The resistance of prions to conventional chemical and physical procedures designed to inactivate viruses and bacteria means that infected tissues must be analysed under biocontainment conditions. Analysis equipment must in many instances be dedicated to TSE biomarker discovery following contamination with potentially infectious prions. These issues often preclude the use of the most up-to-date techniques that rely on expensive, often core-facility-based, apparatus.

Ratajczak|Andrew Morris|Ahmed Abdel-Latif|Chi Hwa Kim							We have observed that conditioning for hematopoietic transplantation by lethal irradiation induces a proteolytic microenvironment in bone marrow (BM) that activates the complement cascade (CC). As a result, BM is enriched for proteolytic enzymes and the soluble form of the terminal product of CC activation, the membrane attack complex C5b-C9 (MAC). At the same time proteolytic enzymes induced in irradiated BM impair the chemotactic activity of α-chemokine stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Because SDF-1 is considered a crucial BM chemoattractant for transplanted hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), we sought to determine whether other factors that are resistant to proteolytic enzymes play a role in this process, focusing on proteolysis-resistant bioactive lipids. We found that the concentrations of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) increase in BM after conditioning for transplantation and that both S1P and, as we show here for the first time, C1P are potent chemottractants for HSPCs. Next, we observed that C5-deficient mice that do not generate MAC show impaired engraftment of HSPCs. In support of a role for MAC in homing and engraftment, we found that soluble MAC (sMAC) enhances in a CR3 (CD11b/CD18)-dependent manner adhesion of HSPCs to BM stromal cells and increases the secretion of SDF-1 by BM stroma. We conclude that an increase in the BM levels of proteolytic enzyme-resistant S1P and C1P and activation of CC, which leads to the generation of MAC, plays an important and previously underappreciated role in the homing of transplanted HSPCs.

We conclude that an increase in the BM levels of proteolytic enzyme-resistant S1P and C1P and activation of CC, which leads to the generation of MAC, plays an important and previously underappreciated role in the homing of transplanted HSPCs. Introduction Hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) are retained in bone marrow (BM) niches due to the stromal-derived growth factor-1 (SDF-1)–CXCR4 receptor axis and interactions between Very Late Antigen-4 (VLA-4, also known as α4β1 integrin) and its ligand, Vascular Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1, also known as CD106). While HSPCs express CXCR4 and VLA-4, their corresponding ligands, SDF-1 and VCAM-1, are expressed by cells in the BM microenvironment (e.g., osteoblasts and fibroblasts) 1, 2. We have also reported that activation of the complement cascade (CC) may play an important role in stem cell homing, where iC3b - a solid phase product of CC activation, deposited on BM endothelium and stromal cells tethers CR3 (CD11b/CD18)+ HSPCs to stroma damaged by myeloablative conditioning for transplantation 3. It is well known that SDF-1, when employed at supra-physiological concentrations, is a potent in vitro chemoattractant for HSPCs. However, because, as we have observed, myeloablative conditioning for hematopoietic transplantation induces a highly proteolytic microenvironment in BM, and SDF-1 is extremely sensitive to degradation by proteolytic enzymes, SDF-1 secreted by stromal cells and osteoblasts is rapidly degraded under these conditions4, 5. Therefore, while a role for the SDF-1–CXCR4 axis in retention of HSPCs in BM under normal conditions is undisputed, its role following myeloablative conditioning is somewhat less certain and some redundant homing mechanisms probably exist. This latter notion is supported by several observations, such as that i) CXCR4−/− fetal liver HSPCs home to BM in an SDF-1-independent manner 5,6, ii) homing of murine HSPCs made refractory to SDF-1 by incubation and co-injection with a CXCR4 receptor antagonist (AMD3100) is normal or only mildly reduced 7, and iii) HSPCs in which CXCR4 has been knocked down by means of an SDF-1 intrakine strategy are able to engraft, even in lethally irradiated recipients 8. Therefore, we began a search for potential chemoattractants that could direct trafficking of HSPCs, with bioactive lipids as strong candidates, because, lacking peptide bonds, they are resistant to degradation by proteases. We focused in particular on ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which are products of membrane lipid metabolism. It is known that S1P is secreted from cells, while C1P is retained intracellularly and is typically released following cell damage 9–13. Our mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed that the major isoforms of C1P and S1P were detected at higher concentrations in supernatants harvested from irradiated BM than supernatants from non-irradiated BM, which suggests that these bioactive lipids and chemoattractants are released from “leaky” BM cells damaged by myeloablative irradiation. Furthermore, we observed that conditioning for hematopoietic transplantation by lethal irradiation activates the complement cascade (CC) in the BM microenvironment, with the accumulation of soluble C5b-C9 membrane attack complex (MAC). The role of CC and soluble MAC (sMAC) in homing was further supported by the fact that C5-deficient mice, which do not generate MAC, exhibit impaired engraftment of HSPCs compared to normal littermates. In support of a role for sMAC in homing and engraftment, we observed (and describe here) that sMAC i) activates signaling in HSPCs, ii) enhances adhesion of HSPCs to BM stromal cells through the HSPC-expressed CR3 (CD11b/CD18) receptor, and iii) increases secretion of SDF-1 from BM stroma. Based on the foregoing, we propose a novel paradigm whereby an increase in BM of proteolytic enzyme-resistant S1P and C1P and activation of CC with generation of MAC, plays an important and previously underappreciated role in homing of transplanted HSPCs. Thus, modulation of the BM levels of bioactive lipids and CC could become a novel strategy for controlling homing of HSPCs to BM and perhaps other organs as well.Material and MethodsAnimals Pathogen-free, C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD) for bone marrow nuclear cell and bone marrow-derived stromal cell isolation. Four to six-week-old C5−/− and C5+/+ (same background as control) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were allowed to adapt for at least 2 weeks and used for experiments at age 7–9 weeks. Animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Louisville (Louisville, KY).Isolation of bone marrow cells and conditioned media Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were isolated by flushing the femurs and tibias of pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice. Whole bone marrow cells were separated by Ficoll-Paque gradient, washed, and resuspended in RPMI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, South Logan, Utah, USA) containing 0.5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich). Conditioned media of lethally irradiated (1000 Gy) mice were prepared as follows. After isolation of whole bone marrow, cells were incubated in RPMI with 0.5% BSA for 1 hr or 6 hrs at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The supernatant (conditioned medium) was then harvested.Zymography To evaluate matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) secretion by bone marrow cells, conditioned media harvested from these cells were analyzed by zymography, as described previously 14.MAC deposition Immunolocalization of each MAC in the bone marrow of non- and irradiated mice was achieved using the immunoperoxidase detection system 15. Briefly, 4-μm paraffin sections, after deparaffinization and rehydration, were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in absolute methanol for 30 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity and incubated in 10% normal goat serum for 1 hr to block non-specific binding. Following overnight incubation with rabbit anti-murine C5b-9 antibody (1:100, Abcam cat# ab55811), sections were exposed to HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 hr. Immunoreactivity was visualized using the liquid DAB Substrate Chromogen System (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis MO, USA). Sections were rinsed thoroughly in tap water, lightly counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, cleared in xylene, and mounted using mounting media.Proteolytic degradation of recombinant SDF-1 (CXCL12) Recombinant human SDF-1 (rhSDF-1, 100ng) purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) was exposed to each of four kinds of proteases in the absence or presence of specific inhibitors as follows: recombinant human matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2, 100ng, R&D Systems) and its inhibitors, SB-3CT (100ng, Sigma-Aldrich) or ARP101 (100ng, Sigma-Aldrich); MMP-9 (100ng, R&D Systems) and its inhibitor, SB-3CT; human cathepsin G (100ng, Athens Research & Technology, Athens, GA, USA) and its inhibitor, α1-antichymotrypsin (100ng, Sigma); and human neutrophil elastase (100ng, Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ, USA) and its inhibitor, elastase inhibitor II (CMK 50ng, Calbiochem). MMP-2 and MMP-9 were dissolved or diluted with TCNB buffer (50mM Tris, 10mM CaCl2, 150mM NaCl, 0.05% Brij-35, pH 7.5) and activated overnight in the presence of p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA, Sigma-Aldrich) before adding to the reaction mixture. rhSDF-1 (100ng/μl) was pre-incubated with each inhibitor or buffer for 1 hr and subsequently exposed to proteases overnight at 37°C.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for SDF-1 Residual SDF-1 after digestion with proteases was measured by ELISA. Immunoplates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were coated with mouse anti-human SDF-1 monoclonal antibody (clone 79018, 5μg/ml, R&D systems) and captured overnight at 4°C. After blocking with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature, SDF-1 mixtures were exposed to proteolytic enzymes +/− inhibitors, diluted (1:100 or 1:500), standards added to duplicate wells, and incubated overnight at 4°C. The wells were washed and incubated with biotinylated mouse anti-human SDF-1 monoclonal antibody (0.2μg/ml, R&D systems) for detection. After incubation for 1 hr at room temperature, plates were washed and incubated with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Jackson, Immunoresearch Laboratory) for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were then washed several times and developed with 1.1mM 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1M citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.01% H2O2. Standard curves were generated using recombinant mouse or human SDF-1 (R&D Systems).Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) EIA Quantification of PGE2 was analyzed by PGE2 express EIA kit (Cayman Chemical company, Ann Arbor, MI). Mouse stromal cells were isolated from bone marrow and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Stromal cells were starved for 6 hrs before stimulation and stimulated with S1P and C1P for 3hrs. PGE2 concentrations of harvested supernatant were determined according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Chemotaxis and colony-forming assays Medium (650μl/well) containing either no chemoattractant, rhSDF-1 (0–500ng/ml), sphingosine-1-phosphate (0–0.5μM, Cayman Chemical, Michigan, USA), or ceramide-1-phosphate (0–100μM, from bovine brain, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the lower chambers of a Costar Transwell with 5-μm filter, 24-well plate (Costar Corning, Cambridge, MA, USA). Cell suspension (1 × 106 cells/100 μl) was loaded into the upper chambers, and the cultures were incubated (37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2) for 3 hrs, and subsequently cells in the lower chambers were harvested and counted by FACS. Migrated cells were assayed for the number of colony-forming units of granulocytes/macrophages (CFU-GM). Briefly, cells were resuspended in human methylcellulose base media provided by the manufacturer (R&D Systems), supplemented with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, 25ng/ml) and interleukin-3 (IL-3, 10ng/ml) for CFU-GM, with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF, 20ng/ml) for CFU-granulocyte (G), with macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF, 10ng/ml) for CFU macrophage (M), with erythropoietin (EPO, 5 units/ml, Stem cell Tech.) and stem cell factor (SCF, 5ng/ml) for burst-forming units (BFU-E), and with thrombopoietin (TPO, 100ng/ml) for CFU-megakaryocyte (Meg). Cultures were incubated for 7–10 days, at which time they were scored under an inverted microscope for the number of each type of colony. For the colony forming units-spleen (CFU-S) assays, lethally irradiated mice were transplanted with bone marrow cells (1 × 105 cells) pre-treated with soluble MAC (sMAC) for 3 hrs. Twelve days later, spleens were isolated, fixed in Telesyniczky’s solution, and CFU-S colonies were counted on the spleen surface.FACS analysis Cell staining was performed in medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were added at saturating concentrations and the cells were incubated for 30 min on ice, washed twice, resuspended in staining buffer at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml, and analyzed with an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). The following monoclonal antibodies were used for detection: phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse CXCR4 (clone 2B11, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) and PE-conjugated anti-mouse VLA4 (clone 9F10, BD Pharmingen).Mass spectrometry measurements of C1P and S1P We have adapted from the work of others and further developed HPLC/ESI/tandem mass spectrometry methods for quantification of S1P and C1P. The method employed uses our API-4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled with a Shimadzu Prominence liquid chromatography system. Lipids are separated on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 column (4.6 × 150mm, 5μm), using methanol/water/HCOOH (75/25/0.5, v/v) with 5mM NH4COOH as solvent A and methanol/water/HCOOH (99/1/0.5, v/v) with 5mM NH4COOH as Solvent B. S1P and C1P were analyzed by HPLC ESI mass spectrometry in positive ionization mode with optimized declustering potentials, collision energies, exit potentials, and monitoring of the following mass/charge (m/z) transitions: C17S1P, 448/388; S1P, 462/402; C12-C1P, 562.436/264.1; and C18-C1P, 644.5/264.4. Calibration of the assay was accomplished using synthetic standards that were independently quantified by phosphorous determination. A known quantity of C17-S1P was added as an internal recovery standard and C12-C1P, C18-C1P, and S1P were quantified by reference to a calibration curve.RNA quantification for SDF-1 Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) from whole bone marrow cells of non-irradiated or irradiated mice to evaluate SDF-1 expression level. Messenger RNA was reverse transcribed with 500U of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase primed with oligo-dT. The resulting cDNA fragments were amplified using the SYBR green system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Primer sequences for β-2 microglobulin (β2 m) were 5′-CAT ACG CCT GCA GAG TTA AGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAT CAC ATG TCT CGA TCC CAG TAG-3′ (reverse). For SDF-1, primer sequences were 5′-CGT GAG GCC AGG GAA GAG T-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGA TGA GCA TGG TGG GTT GA-3′ (reverse). For Cox-2, primer sequences were 5′ TGA GCA ACT ATT CCA AAC CAG C (forward), 5′ GCA CGT AGT CTT CGA TCA CTA TC (reverse). For Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 primer sets were used, as described previously 20. The relative quantity of the target, normalized to an endogenous control gene (β2m) and relative to a calibrator, is expressed as 2−ddCt (fold difference), in which dCt equals the Ct of the target genes minus the Ct of the endogenous control gene, and ddCt equals the dCt of the samples for the target gene minus the dCt of the calibrator for the target gene.Western blot analysis BMMN cells were starved overnight in RPMI containing 0.5% BSA at 37°C and stimulated with SDF-1 (0.05 or 0.3μg/ml), S1P (0.02 or 0.1μM), C1P (20 or 100μM), or SC5b-9 (1 or 10μg/ml, Complement Technology, Texas, USA) for 2 or 5 min at 37°C and then lysed for 30 min on ice in M-per lysing buffer (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). The extracted proteins (30μg) were separated and analyzed for phosphorylation of MAPKp44/42, AKT (Ser473), p38 (Tyr180/Tyr182), Stat-1 (Tyr701), Stat-3 (Tyr705), or Stat-5 (Tyr694) antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA). Equal loading in the lanes was evaluated by stripping the blots and reprobing with the monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies of MAPKp44/42, p38, or Stat-3. The membranes were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Life Sciences, Arlington Heights, IL, USA) and exposed to film (HyperFilm, Amersham).Bone marrow transplantation For transplantation experiments, C5−/− and C5+/+ mice were irradiated with a lethal dose of γ-irradiation (1000 cGy). Twenty-fours hours later, recipient mice were transplanted with 105 wild type BM cells by tail vein injection. Anesthetized transplanted mice were bled at various intervals from the retro-orbital plexus to obtain samples of leukocytes and platelets. To assess the effects MAC in long-term engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells, lethally irradiated mice were transplanted with 105 wild type BMMN cells (sMAC - sC5b-9-primed or unprimed) with 10 mice/group.Adhesion assay Culture plates (48-well) were seeded with bone marrow-derived stromal cells. Sca-1+ cells were sorted by AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA) and pre-treated with SDF-1 (30ng/ml), S1P (0.1μM), C1P (100μM) or SC5b-9 (10μg/ml) for 30 min, washed twice, and loaded onto stromal cells. Fifteen minutes later, cell cultures were washed to remove non-adherent cells, and stromal cells with attached CFU-GM were isolated by trypsinization. These cells were subsequently tested in methylcellulose cultures for the presence of CFU-GM clonogenic progenitors, as described above. In blocking studies, cells were coated with recombinant VCAM-1 (R&D systems) overnight at 4°C and then treated with anti-VLA4 Ab (R1–2, BD Pharmingen) for 30 min prior to VCAM-1 adhesion assay. To assess the effects of the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 (Sigma) or the MAPK inhibitor U0126 (Calbiochem) on cell adhesion, cells were pre-incubated with each of these compounds for 30 minutes before stimulation. In some experiments, BMMNC were obtained from CR3−/− and C3aR−/− mice, and their Sca-1+ cells were isolated. Adherent cells from wt littermates were expanded to grow BM stroma, and adhesion assays were performed as described 3.Statistical analysis Arithmetic means and standard deviations were calculated using Instat 1.14 software (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. Data were analyzed using Student’s t-test for unpaired samples and the t-test for paired samples.ResultsConditioning for hematopoietic transplantation by lethal irradiation induces a proteolytic microenvironment in BM and activates the complement cascade It has been reported that mobilization of HSPCs induces a highly proteolytic microenvironment in BM and that several enzymes released during this process impair SDF-1–CXCR4 interactions by degrading SDF-1, which leads to the release of HSPCs into peripheral blood (PB) 16. In addition, as we demonstrated previously, mobilization of HSPCs also activates the complement cascade (CC) in BM and some CC cleavage fragments (e.g., C3a) modulate migration of HSPCs. Based on these findings, we became interested in whether conditioning for transplantation by lethal irradiation also induces a proteolytic microenvironment in BM and activates CC. Our zymography data (Figure 1 panel A, top) show that at 24 and 48 hours after irradiation, the concentration of MMP-9 is upregulated in conditioned media harvested from BM cells. This was paralleled by activation of CC and deposition of C5b-C9 (MAC) in the BM microenvironment, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining (Figure 1 panel A, bottom). The induction of a proteolytic microenvironment in BM could degrade the biological activity of SDF-1 4, 5. In fact, Figure 1 panel B shows that several proteolytic enzymes released by BM cells, such as MMP-2, MMP-9, cathepsin G (CG), and neutrophil elastase (NE), neutralize SDF-1 chemotactic activity against HSPCs, and that this is prevented by the presence of enzyme-specific inhibitors. More importantly, Figure 1 panel C demonstrates that even when truncated SDF-1 is still detected by ELISA after exposure to MMP-2 or MMP-9, this chemokine is no longer effective as a chemoattractant in chemotactic assays (Figure 1 panel D).While the SDF-1 level becomes downregulated in BM after lethal irradiation, the concentrations of S1P and C1P increase It is widely accepted that irradiation induces expression of SDF-1 in BM 16, 17. Therefore, we became interested in the SDF-1-mediated chemotactic activity of conditioned media (CM) harvested from BM irradiated cells. Figure 2 panel A shows that CM harvested from BM cells 24 hours after lethal irradiation chemoattracts CFU-GM. However, we also observed that exposure of BM cells to the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 before chemotaxis did not significantly affect chemotactic responsiveness of tested cells to these CM. This suggests that factors other than SDF-1 are involved in this process. In fact, Figure 2 panel B shows that both SDF-1 mRNA and SDF-1 protein are downregulated in lethally irradiated BM. Of note, the SDF-1 level remained unchanged in PB of irradiated mice, as in non-irradiated control animals. Based on this finding, we began a search for unknown chemoattractants that could be present in CM from irradiated BM cells, with bioactive lipids as strong candidates. This expectation was based on the fact that bioactive lipids, lacking peptide bonds, are resistant to proteolytic degradation. Figure 2 panel C shows our mass spectrometry finding that two bioactive lipids, S1P and C1P, are strongly upregulated in BM after lethal irradiation.S1P and C1P as novel chemoattractants involved in homing of HSPCs S1P has already been reported to be a strong chemoattractant for HSPCs 15. To our surprise, we found that another bioactive lipid, C1P, in a similar way as S1P, induces several signaling pathways in murine Sca-1+ cells purified by immunomagnetic beads (Figure 3), as well as strongly chemoattacts murine HSPCs (Figure 4 panel A and Supplementary Figure 1). However, both these bioactive lipids and soluble MAC (sMAC), as shown in Supplementary Figure 2 and 3 respectively, do not affect the clonogenicity of murine progenitors for all major hematopoietic lineages. The same result was found for their unphosphorylated forms (data not shown). More importantly, we observed that S1P at physiological serum concentrations is already a much stronger chemoattractant for HSPCs than biologically relevant doses of SDF-1 (Figure 4 panel A). Thus, our data show that while the SDF-1 level decreases in BM due to a highly proteolytic microenvironment, its chemotactic role could be somehow replaced or compensated by an increase in the BM levels of S1P and C1P. Moreover, as shown in Figure 4 panel B, in addition to their strong chemotactic properties, both bioactive lipids, like SDF-1, enhance in a VCAM-1–VLA-4- -dependent manner adhesion of murine CFU-GM to BM stromal cells (Figure 4 panel C). However, at the same time they did not affect expression of CXCR4 and VLA-4 on the surface of HSPCs or secretion of MMP-9 by these cells (data not shown). Interestingly, we also found that C1P and S1P induce expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) in BM stromal cells, while ELISA data revealed that C1P increases PGE2 secretion by these cells (Supplementary Figure 4 panel A and B). This has important implications because PGE2 has recently been proposed to play an important role in HSPC homing to BM 19,20. Concomitantly, we also observed that C1P upregulates the expression of mRNA for the PGE2 receptor (EP3) in BM-derived Sca-1+Kit+Lin− cells (Supplementary Figure 4 panel C). An increase in PGE2 secretion by irradiated BM stromal cells was further confirmed by ELISA (Supplementary Figure 4 panel D). Based on this, we propose that C1P may additionally increase the PGE2-mediated pro-homing effects 19, 20. In contrast to S1P, receptor(s) for C1P have not yet been identified, but our preliminary data showing the effect of pertussis toxin suggest that it will also be a Gαi protein-coupled receptor (Supplementary Figure 5).Transplantation experiments in C5-deficient mice reveal an important role for MAC in engraftment of HSPCs Because our data demonstrated that CC is activated and MAC is deposited in lethally irradiated BM (Figure 1 panel A, right), we asked whether MAC plays a role in homing of HSPCs. To address this question, we transplanted lethally irradiated C5-deficient mice that do not generate MAC, as well as wild type (wt) mice, with wt BM cells. Figure 5 panel A shows that the recovery of leucocytes and platelets was significantly delayed in C5-deficient mice, which do not generate and deposit MAC. In further support of this finding, the bones of mice at day 12 after transplantation exhibited a much lower number of transplant-derived CFU-GM (Figure 5 panel B). To better assess the role of MAC in engraftment of HSPCs, we exposed wt BM cells to sMAC for 30 minutes and subsequently transplanted these sMAC-primed/exposed or unprimed control cells into lethally irradiated wt animals. Figure 5 panel C shows that priming of HSPCs by sMAC significantly enhances engraftment of early progenitor cells, as judged by the formation of spleen colonies (CFU-S). Similarly, priming of BM cells before transplantation by sMAC lead 12 days after transplantation to a presence of a higher number of transplant-derived CFU-GM in long bones (Figure 5 panel D). To address better whether sMAC may affect hematopoietic reconstitution of transplanted mice, normal murine wt BMMNC were exposed ex vivo for 30 min to sMAC and transplanted into lethally irradiated syngeneic recipients (Figure 5 panel E). We observed accelerated recovery of white blood cell- and platelet-counts in animals transplanted with sMAC-exposed (primed) BMMNCs. Finally, Figure 5 panel E shows that sMAC activates signaling (MAPKp44/42 and AKT) in murine Sca-1+ cells purified by immunomagnetic beads, while not affecting clonogenic growth of murine progenitors (Supplementary Figure 3).Molecular effects of MAC that direct homing of HSPCs Finally, we became interested in sMAC-mediated molecular mechanisms that may enhance engraftment of HSPCs. While sMAC did not affect expression of CXCR4 or VLA-4 in murine cells (Supplementary Figure 6), chemotactic responsiveness of BM-derived CFU-GM to supernatants harvested from BM stromal cells (stimulated or unstimulated by sMAC in the presence or absence of AMD3100, Figure 6 panel A), suggest that MAC may enhance SDF-1 secretion by murine BM stroma. Furthermore, sMAC like SDF-1, enhanced adhesion of HSPCs to bone marrow stroma in an AKT- and MAPKp42/44-dependent manner (Figure 6 panel B). However, in contrast to SDF-1, S1P, and C1P (Figure 4 panel C), this pro-adhesive effect of sMAC was not dependent on increasing interactions between VLA-4 and VCAM1 (data not shown). Because we had previously reported that activation of CC in BM leads to deposits of solid-phase iC3b on BM-stromal and endothelial cells and HSPCs are tethered to these deposits in a CR3-dependent manner 3, we isolated Sca-1+ cells from wile type (CR3+) and CR3-deficient mice and evaluated the effect of sMAC on this process (Table 1). Interestingly, we show for the first time that sMAC increases adhesion of clonogeneic progenitors to iC3b deposits in CR3-dependet manner. Finally, however stimulation of murine SKL cells by sMAC induces cells signaling (Figure 5 panel E), this effect seems not to be mediated by a Gαi protein-coupled pertussis toxin-sensitive receptor (Supplementary Figure 5).Discussion Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) are unrested travelers and circulate in peripheral blood (PB) and lymph during development, moving between major anatomical sites where hematopoiesis is initiated and/or temporarily active (e.g., blood islands in yolk sac, aorta endothelium, and fetal liver) before they reach their final destination in the bone marrow (BM) 21, 22. Later in adult life, a small percentage of HSPCs is continuously released from BM niches into the PB, which may be envisioned as a highway by which HSPCs relocate between distant stem cell niches in order to keep the total pool of BM stem cells in balance 23–25. The number of HSPCs in PB increases also during stress situations (e.g., heart infract and stroke), serious infections, and strenuous exercise 26–29. The release of HSPCs can be enforced by some drugs as seen during pharmacological mobilization, which is employed to harvest HSPCs for transplantation. It has been demonstrated that HSPCs released into PB during infections may enter tissues and locally give rise to granulocytes and macrophages or even dendritic cells 30. HSPCs that are released from BM may also return to PB and relocate to other niches in BM via the lymphatic system 30. This reverse process, called “homing”, first requires adhesion and immobilization of HSPCs on endothelium and subsequently their active proteolytic enzyme-dependent migration through the blood–bone marrow barrier to the BM microenvironment. A massive migration and homing of HSPCs from PB into BM followed by their engraftment is seen after hematopoietic transplantation. An important step here is conditioning for transplantation by high-dose γ-irradiation or myeloablative chemotherapy, which destroys endogenous hematopoiesis and increases the number of available stem cell niches in BM 16. The mechanisms that regulate migration of HSPCs out of and back into BM are not well understood. It has been proposed that there is a tug of war over the chemotactic stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) gradient between BM and PB that determines whether cells will be released or mobilized from BM into PB or home back from PB to the BM microenvironment. SDF-1, which binds to the Gαi protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane-spanning CXCR4 receptor expressed on HSPCs, plays an unquestioned role in developmental migration of HSPCs during embryogenesis and their subsequent retention in the BM 16, 31. However, observed changes in the SDF-1 gradient between BM and PB do not always support its having a crucial role as a chemoattractant present in PB that directs egress and mobilization of HSPCs or that it is the only chemoattractant for homing of HSPCs back into BM. For example, as demonstrated by others 8, 32 and us 15, 33, the plasma SDF-1 level does not always correlate with mobilization or egress of HSPCs from BM into PB. Recently, we proposed a novel paradigm where a crucial role in egress of HSPCs into peripheral blood is played by the bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate, which is released during mobilization by soluble C5b-C9 (sMAC), which is a product of the complement cascade (CC) activation. This mechanism has been recently confirmed by other investigators 34–36. On the other hand, there is increasing doubt about an exclusive role for SDF-1 in homing of HSPCs into BM. This is based on evidence that i) CXCR4−/− fetal liver HSPCs may home to BM in an SDF-1-independent manner 6, ii) homing of murine HSPCs made refractory to SDF-1 by incubation and co-injection with a CXCR4 receptor antagonist (e.g., the bicyclam AMD3100) is normal or only mildly reduced 7, and finally iii) HSPCs in which CXCR4 has been knocked down by means of an SDF-1 intrakine strategy also engraft in lethally irradiated recipients 8. All this strongly suggests the existence of other factors besides SDF-1 that are involved in the homing of HSPCs. Moreover, SDF-1, which is a well-known and potent chemoattractant for HSPCs is, as a peptide, highly susceptible to degradation by proteases, which are elevated in the BM microenvironment after myeloablative conditioning for transplantation, as we show here for the first time. By employing sensitive ELISA measurements, we found support for this notion with the observation of a decrease in SDF-1 level in murine BM after myeloablative conditioning for transplantation. Based on these observations, we became interested in other potential factors that, in addition to SDF-1, could chemoattract HSPCs and thus play a role in their homing. Interestingly, we observed that media conditioned by BM cells isolated from lethally irradiated mice show chemotactic activity against HSPCs that is resistant to AMD3100 treatment and heat inactivation, but susceptible to charcoal extraction, which suggests the involvement of bioactive lipids. In support of this notion, it is known that sphingolipids, which are important components of cell membranes, give rise to two bioactive derivatives, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), with S1P already identified as a chemoattractant for HSPCs 32 and C1P for monocytes 37, 38. While S1P is released from cells as an important signaling molecule, C1P is an intracellular second messenger and can be released only from “damaged leaky cells” —for example, after myeloablative conditioning of BM for transplantation. The obvious advantage of bioactive lipids as chemoattractants is that, in contrast to SDF-1, they are resistant to proteolytic enzymes. We report here for the first time that myeloablative conditioning for transplantation not only induces a proteolytic microenvironment in BM but also activates CC, which leads to the deposition not only of iC3b 3 but also to release of sMAC in BM. Furthermore, we also report for the first time that activation of CC correlates with an increase in the BM levels of S1P and C1P. S1P is a well-known chemoattractant for HSPCs 15, 33, but we demonstrated for a frist time that C1P also chemoattracts HSPCs and increases their adhesion to BM-derived fibroblasts. C1P, like S1P, induces activation of MAPKp44/42, p38, Akt, and several Stat proteins. In contrast to S1P, the receptor(s) for C1P is unknown, but because it is sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin, as we report here, it is likely to be a Gαi protein-coupled seven transmembrane-span type receptor. However, despite the fact that the overall SDF-1 level decreases in murine BM after lethal irradiation, the responsiveness of HSPCs to an SDF-1 gradient can be significantly enhanced by some factors such as C3 cleavage fragments 14, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 20 or uridine triphosphate (UTP) 44. Since, as already reported irradiated BM is enriched for C3 cleavage fragments 14 and UTP 44, we become interested in effect of irradiation-induced S1P and C1P in BM on the level of PGE2. As we demonstrate here (Supplementary Figure 4), an additional effect of C1P on engraftment of HSPCs may be related to an increase of PGE2 level in BM and PGE2-related pro-homing activities 20,39. In support of this observation, C1P induces activity of cPLA2, which regulates production of arachidonic acid, a substrate for PGE2 synthesis 40. Interestingly, while S1P and C1P are equally effective in inducing Cox-2 mRNA in hematopoietic cells (Supplementary Figure 4 panel A), cells stimulated by C1P produce more PGE2 (Supplementary Figure 4 panel B). This discrepancy requires further study to see, for example, whether S1P increases the half-life of Cox-2. Moreover, our experiments in C5−/− and normal wt mice have revealed, also for the first time, an important and underappreciated role for CC activation and MAC deposition in the process of BM homing of HSPCs. sMAC has been reported to affect the biology of several cell types 38, 41, but there has, until now, been no report on its effect on HSPCs. The defect in homing and engraftment of HSPCs in the BM of C5-deficient mice described here is supported by the until-now-unrecognized role of sMAC in supporting several steps that facilitate homing of HSPCs. First, sMAC enhances secretion of SDF-1 by BM stromal cells, which probably contributes to ameliorating the drop in BM SDF-1 level in the proteolytic microenvironment induced by conditioning for transplantation. Second, sMAC, as we demonstrate here for the first time, increases the adhesiveness of HSPCs to BM stromal cells in an iC3b–CR3-dependent manner. This is further supported at the molecular level by the ability of sMAC to induce signaling in normal HSPCs. However, if sMAC is employed alone, it does not chemottract HSPCs and, as we have demonstrated here, does not affect expression of CXCR4 and VLA-4 on the surface of HSPCs and does not affect proliferation of clonogenic progenitors. Thus, as we show here for the first time, activation of CC and release of sMAC potentiates the homing properties of bioactive lipids. Of note, while receptors for both C1P and sMAC have not yet been identified, the C1P receptor/s seems to be sensitive to pertussis toxin. Based on these findings, we propose a new paradigm in which S1P and C1P play an important role in homing of HSPCs. While S1P is a major chemoattractant that directs egress of HSPCs from BM into PB, C1P is released from damaged cells in BM after myeloablative conditioning and, together with SDF-1 and S1P, creates a homing gradient for circulating HSPCs (Figure 7). In addition, the pro-homing effects of both bioactive lipids are positively modulated by the end product of CC activation, which is sMAC. We also propose that S1P, C1P, and sMAC play a more universal role in trafficking of stem cells than previously thought and are involved in regulating the migration of circulating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and very small embryonic-like (VSEL) stem cells 25, 30, 42, 43. Accordingly, while S1P plays a role in egress of these cells into PB, C1P, together with S1P locally released from damaged cells (e.g., in infarcted myocardium or brain tissue after stroke) and SDF-1 may chemoattract circulating stem cells for organ repair.Supplementary Material1Supplementary Figure 1 Panel A: The chemotactic activity dose response to S1P and C1P measured by the number of BM-derived CFU-GM is presented. Chemotactic responsiveness to C1P was observed at higher concentrations of this bioactive lipid than for S1P. Panel B: C1P and S1P show some differences in chemoattraction of murine progenitors from different hematopoietic lineages. While SDF-1 at optimal doses chemoattracts all types of progenitors, bioactive lipids show little chemotactic effect against erythroid BFU-E cells.

Diabetes Prevention Trial–Type 1 (DPT-1) participants were assessed for changes in positivity and titers of GADA and IA-2A during the progression to T1D. Among 99 progressors to T1D with GADA and IA-2A measurements at baseline and diagnosis (mean interval = 3.3 ± 1.5 years), GADA positivity changed little and GADA titers decreased ( < 0.01). In contrast, both IA-2A positivity and titers increased substantially ( < 0.001). Even among those positive at baseline, IA-2A titers increased from baseline to diagnosis ( = 57; < 0.001), whereas GADA titers decreased ( = 80; < 0.01). The same patterns of change were also evident among those positive for both autoantibodies ( = 48) at baseline. IA-2A titers increase during the years before the diagnosis of T1D, even among those positive for IA-2A. In contrast, GADA titers tend to decline during those years.	We examined changes in GAD65 and ICA-512 autoantibodies (GADA and IA-2A) during progression to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Diabetes Prevention Trial–Type 1 (DPT-1) participants were assessed for changes in positivity and titers of GADA and IA-2A during the progression to T1D. Among 99 progressors to T1D with GADA and IA-2A measurements at baseline and diagnosis (mean interval = 3.3 ± 1.5 years), GADA positivity changed little and GADA titers decreased ( < 0.01). In contrast, both IA-2A positivity and titers increased substantially ( < 0.001). Even among those positive at baseline, IA-2A titers increased from baseline to diagnosis ( = 57; < 0.001), whereas GADA titers decreased ( = 80; < 0.01). The same patterns of change were also evident among those positive for both autoantibodies ( = 48) at baseline. IA-2A titers increase during the years before the diagnosis of T1D, even among those positive for IA-2A. In contrast, GADA titers tend to decline during those years. Pancreatic autoantibodies are commonly present years before the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) (1–4), and they tend to occur according to a certain sequence (5,6). Yet there is little known about changes in both autoantibody positivity and overall titers as the onset of T1D approaches. In the Diabetes Prevention Trial–Type 1 (DPT-1) (7,8), serial measurements of autoantibodies were obtained before diagnosis. These measurements, together with the large number of participants diagnosed with T1D in DPT-1, provided unique data for studying how autoantibody positivity and titers change over time with progression to T1D.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSSubjects DPT-1 parenteral and oral insulin trial participants (7,8) were all islet cell autoantibody (ICA)-positive relatives of T1D patients. Autoantibodies to GAD65 (GADA) and to ICA512 (IA-2A) were measured along with ICA at baseline. Individuals included in the analyses were selected according to whether they also had autoantibody measurements at the time of diagnosis.Clinic procedures Two-hour oral glucose tolerance tests were performed every 6 months for diagnostic surveillance. The majority of individuals were diagnosed with T1D by oral glucose tolerance test criteria (fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL and/or 2-h glucose ≥200 mg/dL) at a routine study visit. The others were diagnosed clinically. There was no overall effect of the intervention in either trial (7,8).Laboratory measures DPT-1 autoantibody procedures have been described previously (9). ICA was determined by an immunofluorescence assay on frozen sections of blood type O human pancreas in the DPT-1 ICA Core Laboratory (Gainesville, FL, February 1994 to September 1997 and January 1999 to October 2003; New Orleans, LA, September 1997 to January 1999). Combined GADA and IA-2A radioassays were performed at the Barbara Davis Center. Positive testing for ICA, GADA, and IA-2A was defined as ≥10 JDF units, ≥0.33, and ≥0.50, respectively. Although quantitative measurements of GADA and IA-2A were based on indexes, for simplicity we have characterized those measurements as “titers.”Data analysis Student t tests and χ2 tests were used for comparisons. McNemar tests were used for intraindividual comparisons of categorical variables. The SAS 9.1.3 version was used for the analyses. All P values are two-sided. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS There were 99 progressors (mean ± SD age: 11.5 ± 8.3 years; sex: 65% male) who had measurements of both GADA and IA-2A at baseline (3.3 ± 1.5 years before diagnosis) and at diagnosis. A substantial percentage was positive for GADA at baseline, with a slightly smaller percentage positive at diagnosis (80 of 99 [81%] and 76 of 99 [77%], respectively; P = 0.32). In contrast with GADA, IA-2A positivity increased markedly from baseline to diagnosis (57 of 99 [58%] and 80 of 99 [81%], respectively; P < 0.001). Figure 1 shows that GADA titers (Fig. 1A) declined (P < 0.01), whereas IA-2A titers (Fig. 1B) increased (P < 0.001) from baseline to diagnosis. When the parenteral (n = 51) and oral (n = 48) trials were analyzed separately for titers, the same difference in directionality was evident (parenteral: P = 0.14 for GADA, P < 0.001 for IA-2A; oral: P < 0.05 for GADA, P < 0.001 for IA-2A).Figure 1 Shown are titers of GADA (A) and IA-2A (B) at baseline (mean ± SD: 3.3 ± 1.5 years before diagnosis) and at diagnosis in the same individuals. Whereas there tends to be a decrease in the GADA titer, the IA-2A titer increases. White line, median; vertical line, range; bottom of box, 25th percentile; top of box, 75th percentile. We also studied changes in autoantibody titers in those positive at baseline. Among the 80 progressors positive for GADA at baseline with measurements at diagnosis, titers fell significantly (medians: 0.33 to 0.20; P < 0.01). Conversely, among the 57 progressors positive for IA-2A at baseline, titers increased from baseline to diagnosis (0.71 to 0.88; P < 0.001). Among those who were positive for both GADA and IA-2A at baseline (n = 48), GADA titers also decreased (0.30 to 0.14; P < 0.001) and IA-2A titers increased (0.73 to 0.88; P < 0.001). Because DPT-1 participants were ICA positive, we assessed the representativeness of those positive for autoantibodies by examining individuals screened for trial eligibility (n = 92,505). Of the 3,560 GADA positive, 1,353 (38%) were also positive for ICA. Of the 1,484 IA-2A positive, 895 (60%) were also ICA positive. Thus, GADA positivity and IA-2A positivity were frequently associated with ICA positivity at screening.CONCLUSIONS This analysis indicates that GADA and IA-2A positivity are both common over 3 years before the diagnosis of T1D. Whereas GADA positivity shows little overall change with progression to T1D, there is a decrease in GADA titers. In contrast, IA-2A positivity and IA-2A titers increase appreciably. Among progressors already positive for autoantibodies, GADA titers decrease and IA-2A titers increase. There have been no reports of changes in GADA and IA-2A positivity and titer with the approaching onset of T1D, although several prospective studies are currently examining incident autoantibody positivity in children at higher risk for T1D (4,6). Data from a prior report (5) are consistent with our finding that GADA positivity tended to be higher at baseline than IA-2A positivity. The data indicate that more information about changes with progression to T1D can be obtained by examining autoantibody titers rather than just positivity. A significant decline in GADA titers was observed, but not in the frequency of positivity. Moreover, even within the positive range, IA-2A titers increased. The latter finding is consistent with prior observations that within the positive range, autoantibody titer can be predictive of T1D (9,10). Because the DPT-1 participants were ICA positive, we examined the representativeness of the data for those GADA positive and those IA-2A positive at baseline. We found that when individuals are IA-2A positive, ICA positivity is frequently a concomitant. ICA positivity is less common among those GADA positive, but it is still substantial. Thus, the findings are likely to be representative of many who progress to T1D. The decline in GADA among those positive could have been exaggerated by a regression toward the mean. However, this would not affect the overall trend. Moreover, a regression toward the mean would have actually dampened rather than have exaggerated the increase in IA-2A among those positive. Even though autoantibodies are known predictors of T1D (9–11), and are commonly present at the time of diagnosis (1–4), their relevance to the pathogenesis of T1D is still unclear. The differing patterns of change between GADA and IA-2A in the years before diagnosis could be related to pathogenetic processes that are occurring during the progression to T1D.

Introduction In eukaryotes, the availability of the genetic information stored in the DNA is modulated by the interactions of this molecule with a broad spectrum of nuclear proteins, among which, histones represent key players in the regulation of DNA metabolism [1]. Histones are a group of small basic proteins responsible for the packing and compactation of DNA in the cell nucleus, constituting the chromatin fiber. These proteins can be grouped into two major categories: core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) and linker histones (H1 family). The interaction between core histones leads to the formation of an octameric core structure around which 146 bp of DNA are wrapped in approximately one and three quarter left handed superhelical turns, giving rise to the nucleosome core particle (NCP), a highly dynamic nucleoprotein complex which constitutes the fundamental packaging subunit of chromatin [2]. In contrast, linker histones bind to regions connecting adjacent nucleosomes in the chromatin fiber, mediating chromatin compaction through the assembly of higher order chromatin structures [3]. However, the role played by these proteins goes far beyond these structural considerations. They additionally have critical functions for chromatin metabolism (including DNA transcription, replication, recombination and repair, among other processes) by regulating the access of different cellular components to DNA [4]. The different ways in which histones can affect chromatin metabolism constitute what has been defined as the ‘histone language’ which is based on a ‘histone code’ [5], [6]. Such code results from the combination of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) [7] and the specialization imparted to chromatin by the exchange of canonical histones by specialized histone variants [8]. Each histone family encompasses a set of minoritary variants, in addition to the main group of canonical proteins, all of them being amenable for PTMs [9]. Among core histones, the H2A family is of great interest due to the high diversity of specialized variants it displays, including proteins involved in critical cellular processes [6]. Indeed, two H2A variants stand out regarding their functional relevance: on one hand, the histone H2A.X is involved in apoptosis, meiosis and replication through its role in the maintenance of genome integrity [6], [10]. Upon DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs), H2A.X histones of extensive regions flanking a damaged site become reversibly phosphorylated at their C-terminal SQEY motif (γ-H2A.X) creating the so-called ‘H2A.X foci’. This mechanism promotes the dynamic remodeling of chromatin, constituting the primary signal activating the mechanism of DNA DSB repair within the cell nucleus [10], [11]. On the other hand, histone H2A.Z plays critical roles in gene regulation as well as in the establishment of chromatin boundaries [12], [13]. Furthermore, different reports have directly or indirectly suggested the participation of H2A.Z in the maintenance of genome integrity. For instance, the exchange of γ-H2A.X with H2A.Z seems to facilitate the recruitment of DNA repair factors and checkpoint factors [14], [15], [16]. The interest in the study of this variant is thus reliant on its relevance for cell viability as well as on the controversy raised by its apparently dual function in regulating gene activation/repression [17], [18]. The rekindling of the interest in chromatin research during the last 20 years has led to a careful characterization of chromatin structure and dynamics in a wide range of model systems, most notably mammals. However, detailed studies on this matter are very limited in almost any other group [19], most notably in the case of protostome animals. Molluscs are of special interest for the study of chromatin within this latter group due to two main reasons: first, histone genes are subject to an intense diversification process within this taxonomic group [20], [21], [22]; and second, bivalve molluscs are sentinel organisms widely used in the biomonitoring of pollution in the marine environment, encompassing outstanding economic relevance for the aquaculture industry [23]. Within this frame, the close connection between the genotoxic effect of different pollutants in the marine environment (i.e., marine biotoxins, oil spills) and the role played by H2A.X and H2A.Z variants in the maintenance of genome integrity opens up a very interesting research pipeline with dual benefits: first, to shed light on the mechanisms underlying chromatin metabolism and dynamics in molluscs; and second, to develop quick and efficient chromatin-based genotoxicity tests in pollution biomonitoring programs [23]. In the present work we identify for the first time the presence of functionally differentiated histone H2A.X and H2A.Z variants in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, a marine mollusc widely used in biomonitoring programs. Our results suggest that these variants are functionally specialized, based on their active expression, their evolutionary conservation as well as the specialization they impart to nucleosomes. The implications of these results for the development of chromatin-based genotoxicity tests are discussed here.Results and DiscussionHistone H2A.X and H2A.Z gene variants are present in the genome of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis In the present work, the genes encoding histone H2A.X and H2A.Z variants have been identified for the first time in a bivalve mollusc (the mussel M. galloprovincialis). The complete cDNA sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers HQ242648 (MgH2A.X) and HQ242649 (MgH2A.Z). Complete cDNA sequences were obtained from polyadenylated mRNAs extracted from male gonad using RT-PCR and RACE experiments. The sequence corresponding to histone H2A.X (MgH2A.X, Fig. 1A) consisted of 548 bp, containing a 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of 47 bp, a 3′ UTR of 96 bp, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 405 bp encoding a H2A.X protein of 134 residues. In the case of H2A.Z (MgH2A.Z, Fig. 2A) the cDNA sequence consisted of a ORF of 384 bp encoding a MgH2A.Z protein of 127 residues, flanked by 5′ and 3′ UTR regions of 43 bp and 359 bp, respectively. Both sequences exhibited canonical polyadenylation signal sites (AATAAA) and a polyadenylation tail at 3′ UTR regions.10.1371/journal.pone.0030006.g001Figure 1Nucleotide and protein sequences determined for the histone H2A.X variant in M. galloprovincialis.

The 5′ and 3′ UTR regions are indicated in lowercase, the coding region in capitals, the protein sequence in capitals and boldface, and the polyadenylation site is underlined. Internal primers designed for RT-PCR and RACE experiments (boldface colored DNA sequences) are indicated in the right margin of the sequence. B) Protein sequence alignment of different H2A.X proteins (GenBank accession numbers: Human, NM_002105; Xenopus laevis, NM_001092630; Anopheles gambiae, XM_320674; Schizosaccharomyces pombe, NM_001023170). The amino (N) and carboxy (C) terminal ends of the H2A.X protein, as well as the secondary structure of the histone fold motif, are represented above the alignment. The archetypal SQEY motif involved in the formation of the H2A.X foci is indicated in grey background.10.1371/journal.pone.0030006.g002Figure 2Nucleotide and protein sequences of the histone H2A.Z variant in M. galloprovincialis. A) Nucleotide and protein sequences encoded by the H2A.Z cDNA isolated by RACE (GenBank accession number HQ242649). The 5′ and 3′ UTR regions, coding region, protein sequence, polyadenylation site and internal primers are indicated as in Fig. 1. B) Protein sequence alignment of different H2A.Z proteins (GenBank accession numbers: Human H2A.Z-1, NM_002106; Human H2A.Z-2, NM_012412; Xenopus laevis H2A.Z-1, NM_001086059; Xenopus laevis H2A.Z-2, NM_001092643; Anopheles gambiae, XM_310818; Schizosaccharomyces pombe, NM_001021524). The amino (N) and carboxy (C) terminal ends of the H2A.Z protein, as well as the secondary structure of the histone fold motif, are represented above the alignment. The amino acid sequence obtained for MgH2A.X is characteristic by showing a SQEF motif located at the C-terminal region of the protein (highlighted in grey background in Fig. 1B), displaying a high degree of similarity to the archetypal SQEY motif specific to most vertebrate H2A.X proteins. Given that this motif represents a consensus sequence for kinases (involved in the phosphorylation of the serine residue) during the early response to DNA double-strand breaks [10], [24], its presence in MgH2A.X could be potentially linked to a similar role in this group of molluscs. Indeed, comparisons among primary H2A.X protein structures across different organisms revealed a high degree of conservation of the protein region containing this motif (Fig. 1B), lending further support to the presence of intense selective constraints preserving the function on this variant. A high degree of protein conservation is even more evident in the case of H2A.Z proteins (Fig. 2B), emphasizing the functional relevance of these variants across the evolutionary scale. However, contrary to the case of H2A.Z from chordates, MgH2A.Z lacks the characteristic triresidue signature, displaying only the two first residues (alanine, asparagine) at positions 16 and 45 in the alignment shown Fig. 2B [18]. The primary structure displayed by MgH2A.Z is similar to that found in different protostomes and consistent with the stepwise mutation model for the origin of vertebrate H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 proteins [17], [18]. The phylogeny shown in Fig. 3 summarizes the evolutionary relationships reconstructed for H2A proteins in several groups of eukaryotes (see [18] for a complete list of the sequences used and their accession numbers), including histone H2A.Bbd [25], [26], the group comprising H2A.Z variants [22] and macroH2A [27], [28]. While the aforementioned H2A variants display a common feature (they all have monophyletic origins), histone H2A.X is peculiar by showing a recurrent process of differentiation across evolution, implying that it has had multiple evolutionary origins as previously reported [10], [29]. When examining the position occupied by Mytilus H2A variants in the tree topology it is evident that MgH2A.X appears interspersed with canonical H2A types (similarly to H2A.X proteins from other organisms), showing a close relationship with canonical H2A histones from molluscs. On the other hand, MgH2A.Z clusters within the monophyletic group encompassing eukaryotic H2A.Z proteins, closely related to H2A.Z proteins from non-chordate organisms (see subtree in the right handside of the topology). Overall, our results suggest that genes encoding MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z are functionally transcribed in the genome of the mussel Mytilus, encoding histone variants highly similar to those of deuterostomes probably as a consequence of the presence of strong functional constraints leading to their evolutionary conservation.10.1371/journal.pone.0030006.g003Figure 3Phylogenetic relationships among histone H2A proteins from different eukaryotes (see [18]), indicating the evolutionary position of MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z histones (highlighted in red and light-blue backgrounds, respectively). The different H2A types are indicated in the topology, including canonical H2A proteins (blue), and the variants H2A.X (red), macroH2A (green), the H2A.Z fraction (light-blue) and H2A.Bbd (purple). Circles indicate the monophyletic origin for the corresponding group of variants. MgH2A.X, similarly to H2A.X proteins from other organisms, appears interspersed with canonical H2A types, showing a close relationship with canonical H2A histones from molluscs. MgH2A.Z is, on the other hand, clustered within the monophyletic group encompassing eukaryotic H2A.Z proteins, closely related to H2A.Z proteins from non-chordate organisms (see subtree in the right handside of the topology). Numbers for interior nodes indicate BS/CP confidence values. Numbers in colored boxes and in boldface account for the bootstrap values obtained in the reconstruction of the maximum parsimony trees using all the informative positions in the alignment. Confidence values were based on 1000 replications and are only shown if at least one of the values is >50%.MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z are actively expressed in different tissues Given the extensive reorganization experienced by chromatin in the germinal cell line (involving DNA breaks/repair during meiosis), as well as the potential bioaccumulation of genotoxic pollutants in the hepatopancreas (digestive gland) of mussels, both tissues were chosen as good candidates for studying the expression and potential role of MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z in the maintenance of genome integrity. With this aim, Mytilus histone proteins were extracted and analyzed using denaturing conditions in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and acid-urea-triton (AUT) gels. As depicted by Fig. 4A, the gonad of Mytilus contains histones with an electrophoretic mobility which is similar to that of somatic histones, as well as protamine-like proteins such as PL-II. These latter proteins replace most of the histone complement during spermiogenesis but coexist with approximately 20% of the somatic complement of histones in the mature sperm [30], [31]. Interestingly, SDS gels revealed the presence of mussel H1 proteins showing similarities (in size and mobility) with the highly specialized histone H5 variant from chicken, supporting the replication-independent nature of histone H1 in molluscs [22], [32]. In addition, the identity of Mytilus histones was further confirmed by two-dimensional PAGE analyses using AUT for the first dimension and SDS for the second dimension (Fig. 4B). Although the occurrence of MgH2A.Z both in gonad and hepatopancreas is clearly observed in the AUT gels, the high similarity between MgH2A.X and canonical H2A proteins hampers the independent identity of both histone types in a single band, its presence becoming only evident after the electrophoretic separation in the second dimension.10.1371/journal.pone.0030006.g004Figure 4Electrophoretic characterization of Mytilus histones and Western blot analyses of MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z variants in different tissues.

B) Two-dimensional PAGE analysis revealing the presence of native MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z proteins in gonad and hepatopancreas extracts. C) Western blot experiments on gonad and hepatopancreas using human-specific anti-H2A.X and anti-H2A.Z antibodies, as well as a specific antibody raised against H2A.X from Mytilus, further corroborating the presence of MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z in these tissues. CM, chicken erythrocyte histones used as marker. MgH4 (Mytilus), loading control for Western experiments. In addition to revealing the presence of native MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z proteins in Mytilus, a further step into the detection and characterization of these variants was undertaken by developing specific antibodies. In an initial experiment, two independent commercial human-specific anti-H2A.X (ABM) and anti-H2A.Z antibodies (ABCAM) were preliminary used in Western blot experiments on gonad and hepatopancreas extracts from Mytilus. The results obtained (Fig. 4C) revealed the presence of positive signals in both tissues, demonstrating the ability of these antibodies in detecting the presence of MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z proteins. However, with the aim of developing a molecular routine specific for the mussel Mytilus, two primary polyclonal antibodies were raised against MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z in order to detect these proteins in vivo. In this latter case, only the Western blot experiments using the anti-MgH2A.X antibody were successful (Fig. 4C), whereas the anti-H2A.Z antibody failed to detect MgH2A.Z. Our results indicate that both variants are not only transcribed but also translated in gonad and hepatopancreas from Mytilus. Furthermore, it looks that MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z are expressed at higher levels in this latter tissue, opening a new research direction into their differential expression patterns. Given that recent reports have pointed out that the functional relevance of different histone variants could be achieved either through transcribed (mRNAs) or translated (proteins) products [33], the experimental evidence supporting the translation of MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z into proteins represents a critical result in order to fully understand their role in chromatin dynamics.MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z-containing nucleosomes organize DNA with slightly different compaction levels Histone variants impart specialized physicochemical features to the nucleosome core particle by dynamically replacing canonical histones, resulting in the remodeling of local chromatin segments associated with specific roles both at structural and functional levels [6]. Accordingly, we have studied the effect of the incorporation of MgH2A.X an MgH2A.Z into the nucleosome core particle of the mussel Mytilus. To this end, Mytilus native canonical core histones and recombinant MgH2A.X an MgH2A.Z proteins were used to reconstitute histone octamers by mixing stoichiometric amounts of Mytilus H2B, H3, and H4 histones with either: (a) native canonical H2A from Mytilus, (b) recombinant MgH2A.X, and (c) recombinant MgH2A.Z. Octamers were reconstituted onto a 193 bp DNA template obtained from the promoter region of the heat shock gene hsp90-1 from M. galloprovincialis, which represents an environmentally responsive gene [34]. Given the involvement of hsp90-1 in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis [35], [36], [37], [38], its choice in the present work bears critical relevance for future studies of chromatin dynamics associated with environmental genotoxic stress. The suitability of this DNA fragment was further assessed by high nucleosome occupancy scores (as revealed by computational analyses using the NuPoP software, see Materials and Methods), including a p53 binding site encompassing potential applications for future genotoxicity tests in aquaculture industry as well as in cancer research [39], [40], [41], [42]. Reconstitution experiments were carried out starting with the purification of the different histone proteins (Fig. 5A) and their subsequent assembly into the three different types (a, b, and c) of nucleosome octamers (Fig. 5B). Complete nucleosomes were successfully reconstituted onto the 193 bp DNA template (nucleosome positioning sequence) from M. galloprovincialis (Fig. 5C). The reconstituted particles exhibited similar electrophoretic behavior on native PAGE experiments, although nucleosome core particles containing MgH2A.Z exhibited a slightly higher electrophoretic mobility when compared with particles consisting only of native core histones. This behavior may be indicative of a slightly more compact organization of the MgH2A.Z-nucleosomes, mirroring differences in charge between canonical H2A and MgH2A.Z proteins [43]. On the other hand, the high similarity in mobility between canonical nucleosomes and MgH2A.X-nucleosomes is consistent with the high degree of homology between canonical H2A and MgH2A.X proteins, whose differences are essentially circumscribed to the C-terminal SQEF polypeptide potentially involved in the response to double strand DNA breaks [10].10.1371/journal.pone.0030006.g005Figure 5Reconstitution of canonical, MgH2A.X-, and MgH2A.Z-containing nucleosomes.

DNA, free DNA; nuc, nucleosome core particles; marker, CfoI digested pBR 322 plasmid DNA used as a marker. The present work constitutes the first report describing the presence of histone H2A variants in the chromatin of a mollusc species. Our results demonstrate that both H2A.X and H2A.Z genes are transcribed and translated into proteins in the mussel M. galloprovincialis, indicating that the evolutionary differentiation of these had already been achieved in this group of protostomes. Furthermore, the specificity in the functional role of these proteins seems to be supported by the evolutionary conservation of different molecular features, as well as by their ability to confer specialization to nucleosomes (most notably in the case of MgH2A.Z). These results have critical relevance for the characterization of chromatin metabolism and dynamics in protostomes. Furthermore, the characterization of two histone variants (H2A.X and H2A.Z) closely related with the molecular response to genetic damage in bivalve molluscs constitutes a very innovative approach for the future development of molecular assays, using these variants as biomarkers in chromatin-based genotoxicity tests. This latter objective will harbor potential additional applications in conservation genetics, for the optimization of mussel harvesting techniques as well as for the improvement of the quality controls (safety of consumer's health).Materials and MethodsEthics statement No specific permits were required for the described field studies. Mussel specimens were collected in the Ría de Arousa (NW Spain, Atlantic coast), in a location which is not privately-owned or protected in any way. The present field studies did not involve endangered or protected species.Isolation of H2A.X and H2A.Z histone genes Total RNA was extracted from male gonad of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis using Trizol (INVITROGEN) and the polyadenylated mRNA fraction was isolated by means of the MicroPoly(A) Purist system (AMBION). The cDNAs encoding H2A.X and H2A.Z genes (MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z, respectively) were amplified through RT-PCR experiments using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (INVITROGEN), and the rapid amplification of 3′ and 5′ cDNA ends (RACE) was performed by using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification Kit (CLONTECH). In order to obtain the complete cDNA sequences of Mytilus MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z genes, specific primers were designed using molecular databases from oysters [44] and mussels [45], detailed in Table 1. Agarose gel-purified PCR products were ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO vectors (INVITROGEN) and transformed into TOP10 competent cells (INVITROGEN). The plasmids were subsequently purified with the QIAprep Miniprep kit (QUIAGEN) and inserts were sequenced in a CEQ8000 sequencer (BECKMAN COULTER).10.1371/journal.pone.0030006.t001Table 1Primers used in RT-PCR and RACE amplifications of H2A.X and H2A.Z genes (GSP, gene-specific primer; NGSP, nested gene-specific primer).HistonePrimerSequence (5′-3′)H2A.XFw-OystCAGGTGCCCCTGTATATTTAGCRv-OystTCCTGGGACTGTGACGAGSP1CGATCCTCCAGCAGCTTTCTTTGACNGSP1CACAGATCCCAATAGTCTATTAAGGSP2TATCTTGCAGCAGAAGTGCTTGNGSP2TCCAAGACATATACAACTAGCCATCH2A.ZGSP1GTCTTCTGTGATCCCTTTTTGCNGSP1ATGTGGAATGACACCACCACCAGSP2GGCGGTAAAGCGGGAANGSP2AAGCTGTTTCTCGTTCCCAGAInference of the phylogenetic relationships among H2A variants All molecular and evolutionary analyses in this work were conducted using the program MEGA ver. 4.0 [46]. The phylogeny of H2A proteins was reconstructed from the obtained p-distances using the neighbor-joining method [47]. Phylogenetic inference analyses were completed by the reconstruction of maximum-parsimony trees [48] using the close-neighbor-interchange (CNI) search method. The reliability of the tree was tested by bootstrap [49] and the interior branch-test [50] methods, producing the bootstrap probability (BS) and the confidence probability (CP) values for each internal branch. Histone H2A sequences of the diplomonad protist Giardia were used as outgroups, given that this lineage is believed to be the first to diverge from all other eukaryotes [51].Protein expression and purification of recombinant H2A.X and H2A.Z histone variants The coding regions of MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z were independently cloned into pET11 expression vectors (NOVAGEN) and subsequently introduced into Rosetta (DE3) Escherichia coli (NOVAGEN) cells. The bacteria were grown in 0.5 L LB medium to an A600 of 0.8, adding isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1 mM. Cells were harvested after 14 h by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and cell pellets were resuspended in 6 M GuHCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer and homogenized with a dounce. The cell lysate was dialyzed against 2 L of 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA buffer for 2 h at 4°C. After dialysis, HCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5 N and cells were centrifuged at 11000 g for 15 min at 4°C. Six volumes of acetone were added to the supernatant and proteins were precipitated overnight at −20°C. The next day, the sample was centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 min at 4°C, dried under vacuum and resuspended in water. The HCl extracted histones were further purified using a Macro-Prep CM Cation Exchange resin (BIORAD) with a 0 to 1 M NaCl gradient in 7 M urea, 20 mM NaOAc (pH 5.2), 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA buffer. The eluted MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z proteins were dialyzed, lyophilized and further purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 as described elsewhere [52].Isolation of native histones from Mytilus Protein extractions and purifications were performed as described elsewhere [53]. Briefly, male gonad and hepatopancreas from Mytilus were independently homogenized with a dounce homogenizer in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture. After homogenization the samples were centrifuged at 3500 g in Corex tubes. The pellets were resuspended in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and centrifuged again at 3500 g. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 0.6 N HCl, homogenized as above and centrifuged in the same way. The HCl supernatant extracts were precipitated with 6 volumes of acetone at −20°C overnight and then centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The acetone pellets were dried using a speedvac concentrator and stored at −80°C until further use. In order to separate histone H1 and Protamine-Like (PL) proteins from core histones, further fractionation of the acid soluble fraction was performed by using chromatography techniques and extraction with percloric acid [54]. The protein extract obtained (eluted core histones) was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 [52].Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) Proteins were analyzed by AUT-PAGE gels (10% acrylamide, 0.5% bis-acrylamide, 5% acetic acid, 5.25 M urea, 5 mM Triton X-100) as described previously [55], and by SDS-PAGE gels (15% acrylamide, 0.4% bis-acrylamide) as described elsewhere [56]. Gels were stained with 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie blue in 25% (v/v) 2-propanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and destained in 10% (v/v) 2-propanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid. Nucleosome core particles were analyzed by 4% native PAGE gels (29∶1 acrylamide∶bisacrylamide) in 20 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) buffer as described elsewhere [57], [58]. Native PAGE gels were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with UV light. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis were carried out as described previously [17]. Briefly, histones were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide AUT gel in several lanes, one of which was cut out and soaked in 125 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 1.43 M beta-mercaptoethanol buffer while the other was stained with Coomassie blue solution. The unstained gel strip was laid horizontally and electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide stacking, 15% polyacrylamide separating SDS gel.H2A.X/H2A.Z-specific antibodies and Western blot analyses The detection of H2A variants in different tissues from the mussel Mytilus was initially carried out by using human commercial anti-H2A.X (ABM) and anti-H2A.Z antibodies (ABCAM). In addition, Mytilus-specific anti-H2A.X and anti-H2A.Z antibodies were raised against polypeptide segments from these proteins displaying high antigenicity indexes after the application of the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale [59]. The polypeptides chosen for antibody production were defined as SQSQEF (in the case of H2A.X) and KAKAVSR (for H2A.Z), located at protein regions specific for these variants and different from canonical H2A proteins. The polypeptides were synthesized at the Peptide Services of the University of Calgary (Canada) and the antibodies were raised in the animal care facility of the University of Victoria (Canada). In the present work, Western blot analyses were performed in order to detect the presence of MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z proteins in vivo. To this end, native histones were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gels, electro-transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (BIORAD), and processed as described elsewhere [60]. Both commercial (unspecific) and Mytilus-specific anti-H2A.X and anti-H2A.Z antibodies were used at a 1∶3000 dilution, membranes were incubated with secondary goat anti-rabbit antibodies (GE HEALTHCARE) at a 1∶5000 dilution, and secondary antibodies were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (GE HEALTHCARE) and exposure to X-ray films. The obtained blots were further probed with an in-house made antibody (Dr. Ausio's lab) raised against Mytilus histone H4, used as a loading control at a 1∶10000 dilution.Nucleosome core particle reconstitutions Three types of Mytilus-specific nucleosome configurations were reconstituted in the present work by mixing native canonical H2B, H3 and H4 histones with either (a) native canonical H2A from Mytilus, (b) recombinant MgH2A.X, and (c) recombinant MgH2A.Z. Three rounds of histone protein titrations were carried out using SDS-PAGE to ensure that all histones were present in equimolar amounts in the final mixtures. Each mixture thus obtained was lyophilized and then resuspended in 6 M guanidinium-hydrochloride, 20 mM mercaptoethanol, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer (1 mg/ml). After 30 min incubation at room temperature, each sample was dialyzed against 2 L of distilled water for 4 h, and then against 2 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT buffer overnight at 4°C [52]. After renaturation, histone octamers were reconstituted onto a 193 bp DNA fragment belonging to the promoter of the hsp90-1 gene from the mussel M. galloprovincialis [34]. Nucleosome positioning predictions for this DNA sequence were carried out by using the NuPoP software [61]. The DNA fragment was prepared by digesting the plasmid containing the 193 bp fragment with EcoRI followed by gel filtration chromatography, and DNA purification was conducted by repeated phenol/chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation. Histones and DNA were then mixed at a histone∶DNA ratio of 1.13∶1 (w/w) in 2 M NaCl buffer. Nucleosome core particle reconstitutions were carried out using a stepwise salt gradient dialysis (2 to 0 M) in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) buffer as described elsewhere [62]. The integrity of the core particles reconstituted was analyzed in 4% native PAGE gels.

To elucidate the mechanisms of neurovirulence caused by these viruses, a preliminary study was design to analyze host's cellular responses during infections of these viruses. An improved mRNA differential display technique (Gene Fishing™) was undertaken to analyze differentially expressed transcripts regulated during HPAI H5N1 and velogenic neurotropic NDV infections of whole brain of chickens. The identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was made possible as this technique uses annealing control primers that generate reproducible, authentic and long PCR products that are detectable on agarose gels. Twenty-three genes were identified to be significantly regulated during infections with both viruses, where ten of the genes have been selected for validation using a TaqMan® based real time quantitative PCR assay. Some of the identified genes demonstrated to be key factors involving the cytoskeletal system, neural signal transduction and protein folding during stress. Interestingly, Septin 5, one of the genes isolated from HPAI H5N1-infected brain tissues has been reported to participate in the pathogenic process of Parkinson's disease. In this limited study, the differentially expressed genes of infected brain tissues regulated by the viruses were found not to be identical, thus suggesting that their neurovirulence and neuropathogenesis may not share similar mechanisms and pathways.

In this limited study, the differentially expressed genes of infected brain tissues regulated by the viruses were found not to be identical, thus suggesting that their neurovirulence and neuropathogenesis may not share similar mechanisms and pathways. Background Influenza is the paradigm of a viral disease in which continued evolution of the virus is of paramount importance for annual epidemics and occasional pandemics of disease in humans [1]. In particular, the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Virus (H5N1), a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family of negative-stranded, segmented RNA viruses continue to pose concern both for public and animal health. As of June 22, 2011, the HPAI H5N1 avian influenza virus has caused 562 human-infected cases, and among them, 329 died [2]. The HPAI H5N1 avian influenza is also rampant in poultry with an epidemic emergence in Vietnam (2620 cases), Thailand (1140 cases), Egypt (1084 cases), 514 cases and 261 cases in Bangladesh and Indonesia respectively from the end of 2003 to 7 July 2011 [3]. Neurovirulence can be defined as the ability to undergo multicycle replication in host brain, inducing neuropathology and acute encephalitis [4,5]. The involvement of the central nervous system during influenza infections in humans and poultry is still unresolved. Although most infections of HPAI H5N1 primarily affect the respiratory system, neurological symptoms have been associated with past influenza type A outbreaks, including the 1918 "Spanish" influenza pandemic [6,7]. In a more recent note, Webster et al., 2004 have reported the neurovirulence of HPAI H5N1 in waterfowl and also the outbreak of HPAI in the parks of Hong Kong resulted in death of migratory birds [8]. The birds infected by H5N1 have shown acute neurological signs ranging from mild encephalitis to motor disturbances [9]. Apart from this, there are also evidence from in vitro studies showing that the infection of primary mouse microganglia and astrocyte with human H1N1 and avian H5N1 influenza viruses could possibly trigger apoptosis and also proinflammatory reactions [10,11]. The outcome of the infection is determined by complex host-virus interactions with a large number of altered transcriptional and translational rates, and functional kinetics of participating genes. There are evidences which clearly show the involvement of many host genes in innate immunity, interleukin activity and vesicle trafficking such as endocytosis and phagocytosis during virus entry in hosts infected with various types of influenza viruses [12-15]. However with regards of the neurovirulence of HPAI H5N1, the mechanism of how the virus causes the neuropathogenesis, the temporal features of the 'cross talks' between host and virus and the cellular response from the infection is still not very clear. To better understand the molecular and cellular basis of HPAI H5N1 avian influenza virus infection and the neurovirulence caused by the virus in poultry, chicken brain tissue was chosen to be investigated in the present study. As a comparison, we also chose to investigate the mRNA transcripts regulated in brains of chicken tissue infected with Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). NDV is an avian paramyxovirus that has recently been assigned to the new genus Avulavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae [16,17]. This particular virus causes Newcastle disease; a highly contagious and fatal viral disease affecting most species of birds especially chickens and frequently responsible for devastating losses in poultry [18,19]. NDV strains can be classified as highly virulent (velogenic), intermediate (mesogenic) or non-virulent (lentogenic). Virulent strains that cause diarrhoea and frequently haemorrhagic intestinal lesions are called viscerotropic velogenic. Strains that cause respiratory and neurotropic signs are called neurotropic velogenic [20]. We used a neurotropic velogenic strain, since chickens infected with both viruses displays similar CNS dysfunction symptoms, such as head shaking, violent tremors, and loss of balance. It would be really interesting to investigate whether both this viruses share the same mechanism or pathway in causing neurotropism towards the host. First, the model of encephalitis of chickens infected by HPAI H5N1 and NDV was constructed, then we employed a new differential display GeneFishing™ PCR technique to compare the gene expression in normal and infected cells and tissues. This sensitive technique is based on the determination of multiple expression patterns of pre-determined sequences and we also combined it with the use of annealing control primer (ACP)™ technology in order to provide a primer with annealing specificity to the template, and allow only targeted product to be amplified without any false artifacts [21,22]. The other great advantage of this technique is that the bands can be isolated and the genes cloned in a vector for sequence identification and stored for further use. Recently, this technique was successfully used by Balasubramaniam et al., 2011 in comparing the mRNA transcripts regulated in 3 different host systems infected with HPAI H5N1. This study have shown host cell responses or the regulation of host cell transcriptions of different permissible cell or host systems following infection with the same virus may have their own specific patterns for altering host gene expressions and may not share similar mechanisms and pathways [23]. We hope that this present preliminary study can contribute to the comprehension of the interaction of the H5N1 and NDV virus with chickens and compare the progress of the neuropathogenesis as well as being a stepping stone for further study of interactions between the selective transcriptome which were up regulated and down regulated during the time of infection and viral proteins.MethodsViruses Avian Influenza virus, isolate A/chicken/Malaysia/5858/2004 H5N1 was provided by Veterinary Research Institute, Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia. The viruses were initially isolated and passaged in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The virus stock was aliquoted, and titrated to determine tissue culture infection dose 50% (TCID50) in MDCK cells. The experiments were carried out in a Bio-safety level 3 (BSL-3) facility at the Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). The velogenic neurotropic NDV strain AF2240 was a gift from UPM. This particular strain causes 100% mortality in susceptible flock [24]. The mean death time and intracerebral pathogenicity index of this virus was 50 hrs and 1.8 respectively, indicating its virulency. The virus was propagated in the allantoic cavities of embryonating specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs. The allantoic fluid containing the virus was titrated and aliquoted in 1 ml lots and stored frozen in -20°C for further use.Chickens and virus infection Twelve 4-week old SPF chickens were inoculated intranasally with 100 μL of PBS containing 106 EID50 virus of the HPAI H5N1 virus A/chicken/Malaysia/5858/2004 H5N1. The chickens were kept in an isolator within a BSL-3 facility of the Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, with food and water available ad libitum. The same batch and age-matched control chickens were treated with PBS pH 7.2. The chickens were euthanized when they displayed apparent central nerve system dysfunction symptoms or were dying. Both the control and infected chickens were sacrificed at the same time. The brain tissues were kept at -80°C until used for total mRNA extraction. This experiment was repeated, but this time using the velogenic neurotropic NDV strain AF2240. Chickens infected with the HPAI H5N1 and NDV are kept in separate isolators. All animal studies were performed according to protocols approved by Animal Ethics committee of the Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia.Messenger RNA isolation mRNA was extracted from the infected (HPAI H5N1 and NDV) and control whole chicken brain tissues using the RNeasy® mini kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.First strand cDNA synthesis cDNA synthesis was carried out according to method previously described by Hwang et al., 2003 [21]. Briefly, the reaction was carried out by dT-ACP1, wherein the 3'-end core portion comprises a hybridizing sequence complementary to a poly A region of mRNA transcripts. Purified mRNA was incubated with 1 μL of dT-ACP1 at 80°C for 3 min, and reverse transcription was performed for 1.5 hour at 42°C in a final reaction volume of 20 μl containing 3 μg of the purified mRNA, 4 μl of 5 × reaction buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), 5 μl of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (each 2 mmol), 2 μl of 10 μmol cDNA synthesis primer deoxythiamine annealing control primer 1 (dT-ACP1; Table 1), 0.5 μl of RNasin® RNase Inhibitor (40 U/μl; Promega), and 1 μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 U/μl; Promega). First-strand cDNA was diluted by the addition of 80 μl of ultra-purified water for the GeneFishing™ PCR, and stored at -20°C until use.Table 1 Primer sequence used in cDNA synthesis and ACP™-based PCRUsePrimer nameSequencecDNA synthesis primerdT-ACP15'-CTGTGAATGCTGCGACTACGATIIIII (T) 18-3'Reverse primerdT-ACP25'-CTGTGAATGCTGCGACTACGATIIIII (T) 15-3'Arbitrary primerACP15'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIIGCCATCGACC-3'(Forward primer)ACP25'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIIAGGCGATGCC-3'ACP35'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIICCGGAGGATG-3'ACP45'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIIGCTGCTCGCG-3'ACP55'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIIAGTGCGCTCG-3'ACP65'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIIGGCCACATCG-3'ACP75'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIICTGCGGATCG-3'ACP85'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIIGGTCACGGAG-3'ACP95'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIIGATGCCGCTG-3'ACP105'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIITGGTCGTGCC-3'ACP115'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIICTGCAGGACC-3'ACP125'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIIACCGTGGACG-3'ACP135'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIIGCTTCACCGC-3'ACP145'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIIGCAAGTCGGC-3'ACP155'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIICCACCGTGTG-3'ACP165'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIIGTCGACGGTG-3'ACP175'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIICAAGCCCACG-3'ACP185'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIICGGAGCATCC-3'ACP195'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIITCTGCGAGC-3'ACP205'-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCATIIIIIGGTCACGGAG-3' ACP, annealing control primer; the polydeoxyinosine [poly (dI)] linkers are underlined. In the table, "I" represents deoxyinosineAnnealing control primer™-based GeneFishing™ PCR Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by the annealing control primer (ACP) ™-based PCR method using the GeneFishing™ DEG kits (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea). The GeneFishing™ PCR technique involved an ACP™ system that had a unique tripartite structure in that its distinct 3'-end target core sequence and 5'-end nontarget universal sequence portions were separated by a regulator, it used primers that annealed specifically to the template, and it allowed only genuine products to be amplified; this process eliminates false positive results. Second-strand cDNA synthesis and subsequent PCR amplification were conducted in a single tube. Briefly, second-strand cDNA synthesis was conducted at 50°C (low stringency) during one cycle of first-stage PCR in a final reaction volume of 49.5 μl containing 3-5 μl (about 50 ng) of diluted first-strand cDNA, 5 μl of 10 × PCR buffer plus Mg (Promega, Madison, WI), 5 μl of dNTP (each 2 mM), 1 μl of 10 μM dT-ACP2, and 1 μl of 10 μM arbitrary primer preheated to 94°C (Table 1). The tube containing the reaction mixture was held at 94°C, while 0.5 μl of Taq DNA Polymerase (5 U/μl; Promega, Madison, WI) was added to the reaction mixture. The PCR protocol for second-strand synthesis was one cycle at 94°C for 1 min, followed by 50°C for 3 min, and 72°C for 1 min. After the completion of second-strand DNA synthesis, 40 cycles were performed. Each cycle involved denaturation at 94°C for 40 s, annealing at 65°C for 40 s, extension at 72°C for 40 s, and a final extension at 72°C to complete the reaction. The amplified PCR products were separated in 1.5-2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide [21,22].Cloning and sequencing Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) bands were extracted from gels with the QIAquick® Gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) and directly cloned into a TOPO-II TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cloned plasmids were sequenced with an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using M13 forward primer (5'-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCAC-GA-3') or M13 reverse primer (5'-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA-3'). All sequences were, in turn, used to perform a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search for gene identification [25].Quantitative reverse transcription--polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) For the confirmation of the differential expression of DEGs, quantitative real-time PCR was carried out for 10 DEGs selected from 23 DEGs. All RT-PCR were set up in 96-well optical plates using 50 ng of extracted uninfected and infected RNA (both H5N1 and NDV) from chicken brain tissues, 10 μl TaqMan Universal RT-PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and 1 μl of primers/probe set containing 900 nM of forward and reverse primers and 300 nM probe was added to a final volume of 20 μl per reaction. All samples were tested in triplicates. RT-PCR program consisted of incubation at 48°C for 30 min, and 40 cycles at 95°C for 10 min, 95°C for 15 sec, and 60°C for 1 min with the Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System® (Applied Biosystems). A non-template control and an endogenous control (eukaryotic 18 s rRNA) were used for the relative quantification. All quantitations (threshold cycle [CT] values) were normalized to that of 18 s rRNA to generate ΔCT, and the difference between the ΔCT value of the sample and that of the reference (uninfected sample) was calculated as ΔΔCT. The relative level of gene expression was expressed as 2-ΔΔCT [26]. Primers for qRT-PCR were designed using Primer3 software http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3.cgi with these parameters: amplicon length, 95-100 bp; primer length, 18-27 nucleotides; primer melting temperature, 60-64°C; primer and amplicon GC content, 20-80%; difference in melting temperature between forward and reverse primers, 1-2°C. Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA). Primer information is listed in Table 2.

Differentially expressed mRNAs using a combination of 20 arbitrary primers and two anchored oligo (dT) primers (dT-ACP1 and dT-ACP2) of the brain tissues infected with 2 different types of viruses (HPAI H5N1 and NDV) were isolated, cloned and sequenced. For each one the brain tissue, more than 100 transcripts were observed however, only distinct up regulated or down regulated transcripts as observed on the agarose gels were chosen i.e. after exclusion of poor bands and bands which did not show much differences in intensity between the control and infected cells. For HPAI H5N1 infected brain (Figure 2) 12 distinct bands could be observed, of which 6 of the transcripts are up-regulated and 6 down-regulated. For NDV infected brain (Figure 3), 11 distinct bands, of which 6 are up regulated and 5 down regulated were isolated. Using the BLAST database search, the 23 differentially expressed genes were identified i.e. 12 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated genes in the samples of infected hosts, compared to the uninfected. The functional roles, sequence similarities and characterization of the differentially expressed transcripts are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. BLASTn searches in GenBank revealed that the differentially expressed genes displayed significant similarities with known genes or expressed sequence tags (ESTs).Figure 2 Gel picture showing DEGs obtained from control and HPAI H5N1 infected brain tissues.

For optimal relative quantification of the 10 selected genes, the fold difference of ΔCT (2-ΔΔCT ± SD) between study groups were calculated (uninfected and infected brain tissues). Resulting values were tabulated in Table 5. In general, the trends of the change of the ten genes' mRNA abundance in the infected and uninfected brain tissues were similar to the changed patterns of their chosen corresponding genes (band intensity) in agarose gels. Among these genes, in brain tissues infected with HPAI H5N1, the mRNA abundance of Hsp70, SNAP25, CRMP2, and septin5 was up-regulated, while vimentin, TBCD were down-regulated (Figure 4). Meanwhile, in brain tissues infected with velogenic neurotropic NDV strain AF2240, the mRNA abundance of Hsp60, IL-8 and TRPV6 was up-regulated while CNTNAP5 were down-regulated (Figure 4). These data provided transcriptional information complementary to the differentially expressed bands detected by the annealing control primer™-based GeneFishing™ PCR analysis.Table 5 Expression changes of some of the selected genes from both the HPAI H5N1 and AF2240 NDV infected brain tissues from the qRT-PCR assayHPAI H5N1 infected brain tissuesGeneControl (2-ΔΔCT)Infected (2-ΔΔCT)Hsp701.00 ± 0.113.48 ± 0.14SNAP251.02 ± 0.054.23 ± 0.09CRMP20.87 ± 0.133.01 ± 0.15SEPT50.55 ± 0.163.76 ± 0.14VIM2.69 ± 0.020.78 ± 0.09TBCD2.14 ± 0.100.77 ± 0.03AF2240 NDV infected brain tissuesGeneControl (2-ΔΔCT)Infected (2-ΔΔCT)Hsp601.00 ± 0.103.26 ± 0.15IL-81.00 ± 0.095.78 ± 0.03CNTNAP52.10 ± 0.100.91 ± 0.13TRPV62.12 ± 0.104.77 ± 0.03 Data expressed in mean ± SEM, n = 3.

However, many pathways that are involved in antiviral defense can also have negative effects on the host, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses, cytokine responses, and apoptosis, resulting in either dysfunction or death of infected and also neighboring uninfected cells. The potential for host pathology due to vigorous antiviral responses is of particular importance for tissues containing vital nonrenewable cell populations, such as the central nervous system (CNS) [27]. Therefore, elucidating the host response from infection of neurotropic viruses is vital in understanding the pathogenesis of CNS viral infections, particularly, in this study, both the HPAI H5N1 and the velogenic AF2240 NDV. Gene expression has been extensively applied to screening of host cellular factors which is involved in many viral infections that may contribute to the pathogenesis of the virus. Among them are the uses of differential display in mining of host cellular genes regulated in HPAI H5N1 infection [23], microarray analysis to screen the changes of mRNA profile of mouse spleen and brain after JEV infection [28,29], and effect of rabies virus infection on gene expression in mouse brain [30]. Microarray technology permits large scale analysis of expression surveys to identify the genes that have altered expression as a result of disease. However, microarray data is known for its unreliable reproducibility of DEGs across platforms and laboratories, as well as validation problems associated with prognostic signatures [31]. In addition, identification of a gene responsible for a specialized function during a certain biological stage can be difficult to determine because the gene might be expressed at low levels, whereas the bulk of mRNA transcripts within a cell are abundant [32,33]. In this preliminary study, we utilized a new mRNA differential display GeneFishing™ PCR technique to screen for regulated cellular transcripts during HPAI H5N1 and velogenic neurotropic NDV infection in chicken brain tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore and compare the host cellular responses from these two viruses in chicken brain tissue, using this new mRNA differential display technique. This technique provides a primer with annealing specificity to the template and allows only genuine products to be amplified [21-23]. The structure of the ACP includes (i) a 3' end region with a target core nucleotide sequence that substantially complements the template nucleic acid of hybridization; (ii) a 5' end region with a non-target universal nucleotide sequence; and (iii) a polydeoxyinosine [poly (dI)] linker bridging the 3' and 5'end sequences. Because of the high annealing specificity during PCR using the ACP system, the application of the ACP to DEG identification generates reproducible, accurate, and long (100 bp to 2 kb) PCR products that are detectable on agarose gels [21-23,32,33]. The present study provides a comprehensive overview on the altered protein expression of chicken brain tissue responding to HPAI H5N1 and velogenic NDV virus infection. It proves that the function of some of the identified genes involves cytoskeleton organization, signal transduction, stress response, macromolecular biosynthesis, and metabolism. Apart from this, the present study also identified the HPAI H5N1 PA gene transcript in the infected chicken brain tissue (Figure 2 and Table 3), demonstrating that the brain tissues were infected by the virus. Overall, our studies have demonstrated that the host cellular responses of the brain tissues to infections with the HPAI H5N1 and velogenic NDV were substantially different from each other. The functional roles, sequence similarities and characterization of differentially expressed transcripts are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Some of the selected identified differential transcripts participating in different biological progresses were discussed as follows. Chicken Vimentin was found to be down regulated in brain during infections with HPAI H5N1. Vimentin shows the most complex pattern of expression of all known intermediate filament (IF) proteins [34] in the host cytoskeleton system. The cytoskeleton system is vital in maintaining cell morphology, regulating the progress of protein synthesis, enabling cellular motion, and playing important roles in both intracellular transport and cell division. The obtained data have strongly indicated the important role of the cytoskeleton system in the progress of HPAI infection in chicken brain tissue as vimentin was significantly down regulated after infection. Apart from that, recent evidence demonstrates that various viruses manipulate and utilize the host cytoskeleton to promote viral infection [35]. Several studies have shown that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease cleaves the IF vimentin and induces the collapse of vimentin in infected cells [36,37]. Immunofluorescence assay study also have clearly demonstrated that the vimentin and beta-tubulin networks collapse and disperse in IBDV-infected cells, prompting speculations to be made whether cytoskeletal disruption may be a critical mechanism of IBDV particle release from infected cells [35,38]. Further elucidation is required to determine whether HPAI H5N1 uses a human immunodeficiency virus-like strategy to cleave vimentin, resulting in highly decreased expression and the collapse of the vimentin network to release viral particles. We also found both the stress response proteins, Hsp60 and Hsp70 are significantly up regulated in both the velogenic NDV and HPAI H5N1 infection in chicken brain respectively. HSP70 is one of the major classes of chaperone molecules and plays many roles in eukaryotic cells, especially when the host is under stress from abiotic factors such as heat and also pathogen attack (plant journal). However, cumulative findings indicate that the induction of Hsp70 is not a general response to viral infection but, instead, a highly specific response with regard to both the infecting virus and the host cell. Phillips et al., 1991 [39] conducted an experiment on the induction of the 70-kDa family of heat shock genes in monkey and human cells infected with different DNA viruses, such as adenovirus type 5, herpes simplex virus type 1, simian virus 40, and vaccinia virus. It appeared that only adenovirus type 5 and herpes simplex virus type 1 were able to induce Hsp70 and that, between three examined Hsps, only Hsp70 was induced, thus accounting for a highly specific response. Apart from, this, there is evidence showing the constitutive form Hsc70 as a target protein of the multistep process required for the entry of rotavirus into epithelial intestinal cells [40,41]. On the other hand, Hsp60 is another type of stress protein that have important role in correct folding of proteins and stabilizing unfolded labile proteins [42]. The heat shock response is a homeostatic mechanism that that protects cell from damage by up regulating the expression of genes that code for Hsp60 [43]. The up regulation of Hsp60 production allows for the maintenance of other cellular processes occurring in the cell, especially during stressful times. However, Sung and Guhung, 2001 have also shown that Hsp60 is an essential factor for the activation of human Hepatitis B Virus polymerase for it to function inside cellular environment, proving the direct involvement of this protein in viral pathogenesis [44]. It would be really interesting to investigate further whether Hsp70 and Hsp60 have similar role in the pathogenesis of HPAI H5N1 and velogenic NDV in brain. From this study also, we have substantial amount of data to suggest that the HPAI H5N1 disrupts normal neural signal transduction associated transcripts in brain. We found that, CRMP2, Septin 5 and SNAP25 genes were significantly up regulated in chicken brain in the time of infection. The chicken collapsin (formerly known as semaphorin) response mediator protein (CRMP)-62 molecule (also known as CRMP2) was originally identified as a signalling molecule of Sema3A, a type of semaphorin protein. The semaphorins constitute a major family of axon guidance cues in central as well as peripheral nervous system [45]. Uchida et al., 2005 have demonstrated that sequential phosphorylation of CRMP2 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5, a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase) and GSK3β was a vital progress of Sema3A signaling [46]. On the other hand, Gao et al., 2001 have evidence showing Cdk5 mediates changes in morphology and promotes apoptosis of astrocytoma cells [47]. So, we would like to postulate that the activation of CRMP2 by cdk5 could be related to the neuron cells apoptosis in chicken brain tissues, induced by HPAI H5N1. Apart from this, Septin5 was also significantly up regulated during infection with HPAI H5N1. Septin5, a parkin substrate, is a vesicle and membrane associated protein that plays a significant role in inhibiting exocytosis. Studies have shown that homologues of Septin5, such as SEPT5 v1 and SEPT5 v2a can bind and be ubiquitinated by parkin. The levels of both these septins can also be modulated by parkin. Both SEPT5 v1 and SEPT5 v2 accumulate in brains of patients with ARJP, whereby patients with ARJP show increased levels of SEPT5 v1 and SEPT5 v2 compared to controls suggesting that parkin is essential for the normal metabolism of these proteins. Unfortunately, insufficient knowledge is available to determine how elevated levels of SEPT5 v1 and SEPT5 v2 might contribute to the pathophysiology of ARJP [48]. Further studies needs to be conducted to elucidate the role played by septins in neurovirulence of HPAI H5N1. Another important finding in this study is the up regulation of SNAP25 transcript in brain tissues infected with HPAI H5N1, a gene involved in synaptic physiology of the brain. SNAP25 gene gives rise to proteins which are known as SNAREs. These particular groups of proteins are involved in all fusion competent membranes of the cell [49]. Fusion cannot occur without SNAREs and is blocked when SNAREs are removed genetically or destroyed by neurotoxins [50,51]. SNAP25 are involved in docking of synaptic vesicles [52] to the presynaptic membrane and thus play a key role in the release of neurotransmitters at the synapse [53], interestingly found to be down regulated in brain tissues infected with rabies virus, resulting in reduced release and uptake of neurotransmitters [54,55], contradicting with our findings. CD163, a member of the scavenger receptor family with cysteine-rich domains (SCRC) identified as a receptor of haptoglobin-hemoglobin (Hp-Hb) and exclusively expressed in cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage was significantly down regulated in brain tissues infected with velogenic NDV. CD163 has been identified as a marker for perivascular macrophages in humans, monkeys, and mice. There are also evidence showing that perivascular CD163 expression is up regulated and the number of CD163-positive cells increases in HIV and SIV encephalitis (HIVE and SIVE) brains [56,57]. However, CD163 is not a "classical" activation marker, because peripheral blood monocytes and most tissues macrophages of normal uninfected controls all express it and because in vitro pro-inflammatory stimuli largely down-regulate its expression, thus suggesting that the down regulated transcript in velogenic NDV infected brain tissue is due to decreased number of activated perivascular macrophages resulted by inflammatory disorder-related apoptosis response.Conclusions Conclusively, the chickens infected by the HPAI H5N1 A/chicken/Malaysia/5858/2004 H5N1 and velogenic neurotropic NDV strain AF2240 displayed severe CNS dysfunction, and infected chickens developed classic nonsuppurative encephalitis. We have managed to identify and isolate 23 authentic genes which were up and down regulated in this study. Some of the identified genes demonstrated to be key factors in the cytoskeletal system, neural signal transduction and protein folding during stress. Interestingly, one of the identified genes, Septin5, participated in pathogenic process of Parkinson's disease which also developed encephalitis and CNS dysfunction as well. Although, the current data is just a preliminary one, it may suggest that both the HPAI H5N1 and velogenic neurotropic NDV may have different mechanism in causing neurovirulence towards the host. Further elucidation of these genes is needed to facilitate the understanding the mechanism of neurovirulence of both viruses especially the interaction of viral proteins with the identified genes.Abbreviations HPAI: Highly pathogenic avian influenza; NDV: Newcastle disease virus; CNS: Central nervous system; ACP: Annealing control primer; DEG: Differentially expressed genes; TCID: Tissue culture infective dose; EID: Egg infective dose; SPF: Specific pathogen free; PBS: Phosphate buffered saline; Hsp60: Heat shock protein 60; Hsp70: Heat shock protein 70; SNAP25: Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa; CRMP2: Collapsin response mediator protein 2; SEPT5: Septin 5; VIM: Vimentin; B2M: Beta-2 microglobulin; TRPV6: Sus scrofa calcium transporter 1; JEV: Japanese encephalitis virus; IF: Intermediate filament; cdk5: Cyclin-dependent kinase 5; ARJP: Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism; SNARE: Soluble NSF(N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) attachment protein receptor.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributions SSH and VRMTB conceived of the study, participated in its design and coordination.

Introduction The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe reproduces asexually by mitosis under favorable conditions. When haploid cells are starved of nutrients, particularly of nitrogen, they arrest the cell cycle at G1 and undergo sexual differentiation [1]. Cells of opposite mating types, h+ and h−, fuse to form a diploid zygote, which undergoes meiosis to give four haploid ascospores that remain dormant until they encounter favorable growth conditions [2]. The transition from the mitotic cell cycle into meiosis is tightly regulated by a network of positive and negative factors that are controlled at various levels of gene expression, from transcription initiation [3]–[6] to protein modification [7]–[11]. One important regulatory component of S. pombe sexual development is Ste11. Ste11 positively regulates transcription of the mating type genes, matP and matM, and the mei2+ gene, which is essential for commitment to meiosis, by binding to an upstream cis-acting element under conditions of nitrogen starvation [12]. ste11Δ mutants are completely defective in mating and sporulation, while ectopic expression of ste11+ leads to sexual differentiation irrespective of nutritional conditions. The activity of Ste11 is regulated by two antagonistic protein kinases, Pat1 and Spk1, via the pheromone signaling pathway [13] and by the TOR protein kinase, Tor2, which is activated in the presence of nitrogen and represses sexual differentiation by directly interfering with the function of Ste11 and Mei2 [11]. Expression of ste11+ is regulated by at least three different signal transduction pathways: mating pheromone signaling (RAS/MAPK pathway), cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) in conjunction with MAPKKKs (Wis4 and Win1), MAPKK (Wis1), and MAPK (Sty1/Spc1/Phh1) [14], [15]. So far, only positive regulatory factors of ste11+ expression, such as Atf1 [6], [16], Pcr1 [5], Rst2 [4], Prr1 [17], and Ste11 itself [4] have been reported. Furthermore, only Rst2 and Ste11 are transcription factors that directly activate ste11+ expression. No transcription factor that directly represses the expression of ste11+ has been identified. Here, we explore the role of Gaf1, the first GATA transcription factor identified in S. pombe [18], [19], in the expression of ste11+. GATA family transcription factors have a wide range of functions, from terminal differentiation in vertebrates [20]–[22] to nitrogen metabolism, siderophore biosynthesis, photoinduction, and mating type switching in fungi [23]. In S. pombe, Ams2 is a cell cycle-regulated GATA factor that is required for centromere function [24] and Fep1/Gaf2 occupies a central role in iron homeostasis by coordinating the reductive and non-reductive iron transport systems [25], [26]. GATA factors recognize a six base-pair consensus sequence, 5′-HGATAR-3′ (where H can be A/C/T and R can be A/G), contained in the promoters of their target genes. Although the C-terminal fragment of Gaf1 (Gaf1565–855) has been shown to bind specifically to the GATA motif DAL7 UAS, a canonical GATA motif of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [18], little is known about the function of Gaf1 in S. pombe. We present evidence that Gaf1 down-regulates the transcription of ste11+ via direct binding to its promoter and consequently delay the shift of nitrogen-starved cells from the vegetative cycle to the meiotic cycle.Materials and MethodsS. pombe strains, media, and general procedures S. pombe strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Cells were maintained on complete medium (YES) containing 0.5% yeast extract, 3% glucose, 2% Bacto agar, adenine (225 µg ml−1), leucine (225 µg ml−1), and uracil (225 µg ml−1). Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM2) [27]–[29] was used as a minimal selective medium. EMM-N (EMM2 without NH4Cl) was used for starvation of nitrogen source, and EMM-G (EMM2 containing 0.5% instead of 2% glucose) for glucose-restriction experiments. All the minimal media were supplemented with required auxotrophic nutrients (adenine, leucine, and uracil) at the concentrations of 225 µg ml−1 each, which led to the presence of a starved amount of organic nitrogen source in EMM-N. Thiamine was added to the medium at a final concentration of 20 µM to repress expression from the thiamine-repressible nmt42+ (no message in thiamine) promoter. Transformation was performed by the lithium acetate procedure [27]. Standard techniques were used for genetic manipulation and analysis [29].10.1371/journal.pone.0042409.t001Table 1S. pombe strains used in this study.StrainRelevant genotypeSource or reference972h−Lab stockED005h− ade6-M210 leu1–32Lab stockED665h− ade6-M210 leu1–32 ura4-D18Lab stockED668h+ ade6-M216 leu1–32 ura4-D18Lab stockJY4h90 ade6-M216 leu1–32 ura4-D18Lab stockJZ396h90 ade6-M216 leu1–32 ura4-D18 ste11::ura4+[12]KL210h− ade6-M210 leu1–32 ura4-D18 gaf1::kanMXThis workKL211h90 ade6-M216 leu1–32 ura4-D18 gaf1::kanMXThis workKL213h90 ade6-M216 leu1–32 ura4-D18 gaf1::kanMX ste11::ura4+This workKL216h+ ade6-M216 leu1–32 ura4-D18 gaf1::kanMXThis workKL230h− gaf1::kanMXThis workKL240h− ade6-M210 leu1–32 ura4-D18 gaf1::hphMXThis workKL416h+ ade6-M216 leu1–32 ura4-D18 ste11::kanMXThis workConstruction of plasmids To construct pREP-Gaf1 with a full-length open reading frame (ORF) of gaf1+ downstream of the nmt42+ promoter, a 2.6-kb fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the following primers: P1 (5′AACCCGGGCCATGGATCTAAAGTTTTCC3′) and P2 (5′AACCCGGGCATAACGCTATACCAATC3′) in which underlines designate SmaI sites. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) to yield pGEM-Gaf1. After confirming the absence of PCR artifact by sequence analysis, the gaf1+ ORF was excised by digestion with SmaI and ligated to SmaI-digested middle-copy expression vector pREP42 [30] to yield pREP-Gaf1. For construction of pGEX4T3-Gaf1 encoding the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged Gaf1 (GST-Gaf1), the 2.6-kb gaf1+ ORF was excised from pGEM-Gaf1 by SmaI-digestion and cloned in frame into the SmaI site of pGEX4T3 (Amersham). A lacZ-based reporter plasmid used for analysis of ste11+ promoter was constructed as follows. First, the replication origin of S. pombe, ars1+, was amplified from pESP1 (Stratagene) by PCR using primers P3 (5′CCGAATTCAGGCCTGAGTCTAACTCCTTAACCACT3′; underline designates StuI site) and P4 (5′CCGATATCCAACCTTCCAATTCATTAAATC3′; underline designates EcoRV site). The 1.2-kb DNA fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector to yield pGEM-ars1. A 1.5-kb fragment containing the kanMX gene was amplified from pFA6a-kanMX6 [31] using PCR primers P5 (5′CCGATATCGGGTTAATTAAGGCGCGCCAGA3′; underline designates EcoRV site) and P6 (5′CCGCATGCCACTGGATGACGGCGTTAGTAT3′; underline designates SphI site) and inserted into the pGEM-T vector to yield pGEM-kanMX6. The 1.5-kb kanMX fragment was then excised by EcoRV-SphI double digestion and subcloned into EcoRV-SphI-digested pGEM-ars1. From the resulting pGEM-ars1-kanMX6 vector, a 2.7-kb fragment containing both ars1 and kanMX was excised with SphI, Klenow enzyme, and StuI. The resulting 2.7-kb SphI(blunted)-StuI fragment was then ligated with the 6.5-kb SnaBI-StuI fragment of YEp353 plasmid to yield pJLC-LacZ. Then a 1.4-kb BamHI fragment containing the promoter region of ste11+ from −834 to +575 (the major transcription start site is assigned as position +1 for nucleotide numbering) [4] was PCR-amplified using primers P7 (5′GGATCCGCATGCCATCTCCAGGGAT3′) and P8 (5′GGATCCCAAAAGAACGTAGAGGCAA3′) in which underlines designate BamHI sites. The reporter plasmid pJLC-Ste11(p)-LacZ was constructed by subcloning the PCR-amplified 1.4-kb BamHI fragment into the BamHI site of pJLC-LacZ upstream of lacZ in the correct orientation.Gene disruption Construction of gaf1Δ strains was performed by direct chromosomal integration as described previously [28]. The 2.6-kb genomic regions corresponding to the entire gaf1+ ORF (855 amino acids) of the wild-type strains, 972, ED665, JY4, and ED668, carrying different auxotrophic markers or mating type were replaced with the 1.5-kb PCR-amplified gaf1::kanMX deletion cassette derived from pFA6a-kanMX4 [32]. Stable transformants were selected by resistance to G418, and the disruptions were confirmed by PCR with appropriate primers (data not shown) yielding the gaf1Δ strains, KL230, KL210, KL211, and KL216, respectively. ste11Δ strain JZ396 [kindly donated by Dr. Yamamoto [12]] was transformed with the gaf1::kanMX deletion cassette to yield the gaf1Δ ste11Δ double-deletion mutant (KL213). To construct a gaf1Δ strain carrying the hphMX marker, the gaf1::kanMX allele of KL210 strain was replaced with the 1.6-kb gaf1::hphMX deletion cassette amplified from pFA6a-hphMX6 [33]. Stable transformants were selected by resistance to hygromycin B and sensitivity to G418 (indicating loss of kanMX), and the disruptions were confirmed by PCR (data not shown) to yield strain KL240.Growth tests To analyze growth by plate assays, S. pombe cells grown to mid-exponential phase in EMM2 for 18 h were washed and resuspended in EMM2-N (for nitrogen starvation) or EMM-G (for glucose restriction) to a concentration of 5×106 cells ml−1. The cell suspensions were serially diluted in 5-fold steps, and then a 5 µl aliquot of each dilution was spotted onto EMM, EMM-N, and EMM-G plates. The plates were incubated at 30°C and photographed after 3 d.Preparation of total RNA For preparation of total RNA, wild-type (ED668) and gaf1Δ (KL216) strains were grown to mid-log phase in EMM2 for 18 h at 30°C. Cells were harvested from the mid-log phase cultures and used as unstarved cell preparations (+N). To prepare nitrogen-starved cell samples (−N), cells harvested from the mid-log phase cultures in EMM2 were washed with distilled water and shifted to EMM-N. Nitrogen-starved cells used for microarray analysis were harvested 4-h cultivation in EMM-N. For Northern blot analysis, aliquots of the nitrogen-starved culture were removed at intervals, i.e., at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 18 h after shift. The cells were washed twice with distilled water and frozen immediately at −70°C for total RNA preparation. Total RNA samples were extracted from approximately 2×108 cells using a bead beater as described previously [12].Microarray analysis Thirty-microgram total RNA of each sample was further purified using RNeasy (QIAGEN) columns and submitted for microarray analysis by the SeouLin Bioscience (Korea). Probes were generated and hybridized to the GeneChip Yeast Genome 2.0 Array (Affymetrix), and the data were analyzed using GeneSpring GX software (Agilent).Northern blot analysis Approximately 20 µg of total RNA was fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing 18% formaldehyde, transferred onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham), and fixed by UV cross-linking (Stratagene). DNA probes for ste11+, gaf1+, and actin (act1+) genes were prepared using the PCR fragments amplified with the following primer pairs: P11 (5′GACCTGCGATCCAGATGATT3′) and P12 (5′CCAACAGCACTCTTGACGAA3′) for ste11+; P13 (5′TTACAACTTGCGTCCAGCA3′) and P14 (5′TGAATTCAGGAGCACCTTCC3′) for gaf1+; and P15 (5′GAAGCACACCATGACGCTTA3′) and P16 (5′CCTTGATCTCACCACAAGCA3′) for act1+. The DNA probes were labeled with [α-32p]-dCTP using a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Amersham). Hybridization was carried out at 42°C overnight in Rapid-hyb solution (Amersham). The signal was visualized by exposing the membrane to X-ray film and the relative signal intensity was quantified using a shareware program (Scion Image Beta 4.0.2).Flow cytometric analysis For flow cytometry, cells grown to mid-log phase (5×106 cells ml−1) were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol containing 50 mM sodium citrate overnight at 4°C. After brief centrifugation, cell pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 7) and treated with RNase A (10 µg ml−1) at 37°C for 2 h. The cells were stained with propidium iodide (16 µg ml−1) and analyzed using a BD FACScalibur Flow Cytometer as described previously [28]. Data were analyzed using WinMDI software, version 2.8.Mating and sporulation assay In order to monitor the efficiency of sporulation, S. pombe cells grown to mid-log phase were prepared by two successive transfers of young colonies on EMM2 agar plates. The cells were then collected and washed three-times with distilled water. Suspensions of homothallic haploid cells (h90) or mixtures of mating pairs (h+ and h−) were spotted in 10 µl aliquots (1.0×109 cells) onto EMM2 and EMM-N agar plates. Cultures were grown at 30°C, and the cells were observed at intervals by DIC microscopy to determine sporulation frequencies. At least 400 cells from three independent experiments were evaluated, and mating and sporulation frequencies (FM) were calculated using the following equation [34]: FM (%) = (2Z+2A+0.5S)×100/(H+2Z+2A+0.5S), where Z stands for the number of zygotes, A for the number of asci, S for the number of free spores, and H for the number of cells that failed to mate. When necessary, sporulation was visualized by iodine vapor staining.β-Galactosidase reporter assay S. pombe cells containing β-galactosidase reporter plasmids were pre-grown to mid-log phase in liquid EMM2 medium for 18 h and shifted to EMM2 or EMM-N medium. Cells were harvested at intervals by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended at a concentration of 5×106 cells ml−1. After the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% sodium lauroylsarcosinate, β-galactosidase activity was determined by measuring hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate, o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside, as described previously [35].Electrophoretic mobility shift assay To prepare GST and GST-Gaf1 fusion proteins for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), cells of Escherichia coli BL21 strains carrying pGEX4T3 or pGEX4T3-Gaf1 were cultured in LB medium with 50 µg ml−1 of ampicillin at 30°C to A600 of 0.5. Isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the cells were grown for 4 h at 25°C. Harvested cells were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 7.6; 137 mM NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 µg ml−1 lysozyme. Resuspended cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 24,000×g for 20 min at 4°C. The protein extracts were purified through a Glutathione Sepharose 4B column (Amersham). To prepare EMSA probes and cold competitors, the upstream 0.60-kb SphI-NdeI (PA) and downstream 0.25-kb NdeI-EcoRV (PB) segments of the partial ste11+ promoter region [4] were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of S. pombe 972 using the following primers: P17 (5′GCATGCCATCTCCAGGGA3′) and P18 (5′ACATATGATGCGAAAGCATT3′) for PA; and P19 (5′CATATGTTACTTTAACCCCT3′) and P20 (5′GGATATCCTTTTAATATATGCT3′) for PB. Specific double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for wild-type (PW) and mutant (PM) GATA motifs corresponding to nucleotides −385 to −352 of the ste11+ promoter were prepared by annealing complementary pairs of the following single-stranded oligonucleotides: P21 (5′CATTTTGCCTTGCGCTATCTCCCTCAACGAAAAG3′) and P22 (5′CTTTTCGTTGAGGGAGATAGCGCAAGGCAAAATG3′) for PW; and P10 and P9 for PM. The duplex DNAs were end-labeled with [γ-32P] ATP by T4-polynucleotide kinase and purified using a G-50 or G-25 column (Amersham). All binding reactions were carried out in 20 µl binding buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol) containing 2 µg of poly (dI·dC) as a non-specific competitor, 0.1–1 µg of recombinant GST-Gaf1 protein, and 5 ρmol 32P-end-labeled double-stranded probe, at room temperature for 20 min. For competition experiments, DNA binding reactions were allowed to reach equilibrium and a 50- or 100-fold excess of unlabeled specific competitor DNA was added to the binding reaction mixture. For detection of a specific DNA-protein complex, samples were loaded onto a 6% non-denaturation polyacrylamide gel in 0.5×Tris-glycine buffer and electrophoresed at 10 V cm−1 at room temperature. The gels were run for 2 h, dried on a gel dryer and autoradiographed at −70°C using Fuji X-ray film. Putative binding sites for transcription factors were searched by using TRANSFAC program (http://gene-regulation.com/pub/databases.html).ResultsDeletion of gaf1+ causes accelerated G1-arrest under nitrogen-starved conditions Previously, we suggested that gaf1+ might function as a transcriptional activator, although its biological relevance was unclear as a deletion mutant showed no significant defects [18]. However, recent genome analysis revealed that the gaf1+ sequence previously reported (Accession No. AAC35593) contains only a partial ORF corresponding to the C-terminal 290-amino acid segment of Gaf1, and that the complete gaf1+ sequence comprises a 2,565-bp ORF encoding an 855-amino acid protein (Accession No. Q10280) [36]. In the present study, we deleted the entire gaf1+ ORF from the genome of S. pombe (Table 1) and evaluated the response of gaf1Δ cells to nitrogen starvation and glucose restriction by plate assay. Cells of the gaf1Δ strain did not show any growth defect on EMM2 or EMM-G plate, indicating that the gaf1+ gene is dispensable for mitotic growth under normal and glucose-restricted conditions (Figure 1A). However, gaf1Δ cells showed significantly reduced growth on EMM-N which lacked the inorganic nitrogen source, NH4Cl, compared to wild-type cells that did grow to a limited extent by utilizing the supplementary auxotrophic nutrients, adenine, leucine, and uracil, as organic nitrogen sources.10.1371/journal.pone.0042409.g001Figure 1Deletion of gaf1+ causes reduced growth on nitrogen-starved medium. Cells grown to mid-log phase in EMM2 for 18 h were serially diluted 5-fold and spotted on agar plates. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 3 d. (A) Cells of WT (972) and gaf1Δ (KL230) strains were spotted on EMM, EMM-N, and EMM-G agar plates. (B) Cells of WT(ED665)/pREP42, gaf1Δ(KL210)/pREP42, WT(ED665)/pREP42-Gaf1, and gaf1Δ(KL210)/pREP-Gaf1 strains were spotted onto EMM-N plates with (+B1) or without (−B1) 20 µM thiamine. WT denotes the wild-type (gaf1+). To confirm that the sensitivity of the gaf1Δ mutant to nitrogen starvation is due to the loss of Gaf1 activity rather than acquisition of abnormal activity, we constructed a system in which the production of Gaf1 could be shut off artificially using the thiamine-repressible nmt42+ promoter. In the absence of thiamine, the gaf1Δ/pREP-Gaf1 cells carrying ectopic copies of gaf1+ under the control of the nmt42+ promoter exhibited growth similar to the wild-type strains (WT/pREP42 and WT/pREP-Gaf1) on EMM-N plates (Figure 1B). In the presence of thiamine, gaf1Δ/pREP-Gaf1 cells exhibited as poor growth on EMM-N medium as gaf1Δ/pREP42 cells. These results suggest that the gaf1+ gene is dispensable for mitotic growth under normal conditions, but apparently plays a significant role in sustaining growth, though to a limited extent, under nitrogen-starved conditions. In S. pombe, as key nutrients become limited, cells exit the mitotic cycle and enter either G0 stationary phase or a program of sexual differentiation [37]. During early nitrogen starvation, S. pombe cells undergo several rounds of rapid cell division and then arrest at the G1 phase [8], [13]. In this study, the gaf1Δ strain accumulated G1-arrested cells after 4 h of nitrogen starvation, but the wild-type strain did not accumulate any detectable amount of G1-arrested cells until 6 h after the nitrogen shift (Figure 2A). Correspondingly, the homothallic haploid strain h90 gaf1Δ/pREP-Gaf1 began to accumulate G1-arrested cells after 2 h of nitrogen starvation in the presence of thiamine, however, it did not show any signs of G1-arrest even after 8 h of nitrogen starvation in the absence of thiamine (Figure 2B). Therefore, the deletion of gaf1+ causes accelerated entrance into G1 under nitrogen-starved conditions. Accordingly, the function of gaf1+ might be to delay the shift of nitrogen-starved cells from the vegetative cycle to the meiotic cycle, helping to sustain the vegetative cycle upon transient nitrogen starvation.10.1371/journal.pone.0042409.g002Figure 2Deletion of gaf1+ causes accelerated G1-arrest under nitrogen-starved conditions. Cells grown to mid-log phase in EMM2 for 18 h were shifted to EMM-N medium, and their DNA contents were monitored by FACS analysis at intervals. The FACS data represent typical examples of three independent experiments. (A) Cells of heterothallic (h−) WT (972) and gaf1Δ (KL230) strains were shifted to EMM-N medium. (B) Cells of homothallic (h90) gaf1Δ(KL211)/pREP-Gaf1 strain were shifted to EMM-N medium with (+B1) or without (−B1) 20 µM thiamine. WT denotes the wild-type (gaf1+).Sporulation efficiency is enhanced by gaf1Δ mutation and reduced by gaf1+ overexpression To evaluate the function of gaf1+ in sporulation under nitrogen-starved conditions, we spotted suspensions of pre-grown homothallic haploid cells (h90) and mixtures of mating pairs (h+ and h−) with or without gaf1Δ on EMM2 (+N) and EMM-N (−N) agar plates and estimated their mating and sporulation efficiencies (FM) after 3-d cultivation. The homothallic haploid gaf1Δ strain showed a significantly higher FM value (24%) than the wild-type strain (7%) on EMM2 plates (Table 2). In addition, the FM value of the h+ gaf1Δ×h− gaf1Δ mating mixture (63%) was approximately 5-fold higher than the h+×h− mating pair of wild-type (13%) on EMM2 plates. The homothallic gaf1Δ strain (85%) and h+ gaf1Δ×h− gaf1Δ mating mixture (80%) showed approximately 10–15% higher FM values than the homothallic wild-type strain (69%) and h+×h− mating mixture of wild-type strains (71%) on EMM-N plates. These results indicate that the gaf1Δ mutation elevates mating and sporulation efficiency by making cells more sensitive to nitrogen starvation.10.1371/journal.pone.0042409.t002Table 2Mating and sporulation frequency of S. pombe strains.Mating and sporulation frequency (%)bStrain genotypea+N−Nh906.5±2.169.2±6.1h90 gaf1Δ24.0±1.285.3±4.4h+×h−12.7±2.571.1±7.4h+ gaf1Δ×h− gaf1Δ62.5±2.980.0±9.6h+ ste11Δ×h− gaf1Δ<0.01<0.01h90 ste11Δ<0.01<0.01h90 gaf1Δ ste11Δ<0.01<0.01a For analysis of homothallic strains, pre-grown cultures of h90 WT (JY4), h90 gaf1Δ (KL211), h90 ste11Δ (JZ396), and h90 gaf1Δ ste11Δ (KL213) were spotted onto EMM2 (+N) and EMM-N (−N) plates, and the cells were observed by DIC microscopy to determine sporulation frequencies after 3-d incubation at 30°C. For analysis of heterothallic strains, 1∶1 mixtures of the pre-grown mating pairs, h+ (ED668)×h − (ED665), h+ gaf1Δ (KL216)×h− gaf1Δ (KL210), and h+ ste11Δ (KL416)×h− gaf1Δ (KL240) were spotted onto EMM2 and EMM-N plates.b The values represent the average ± the standard deviation of at least three independent assays carried out in triplicate. We also evaluated the role of gaf1+ in sporulation using an overexpression system of gaf1+ under the control of the nmt42+ promoter in homothallic strains. In liquid EMM-N medium, no sporulation was observed among h90 gaf1Δ/pREP-Gaf1 and h90 WT/pREP-Gaf1 cells even after 18-h exposure to nitrogen-starved conditions, while a considerable portion of the h90 gaf1Δ/pREP42 and h90 WT/pREP42 cells showed mating behavior after 3- and 18-h exposure, respectively (Figure 3A). On EMM-N plates, the h90 WT/pREP-Gaf1 and h90 gaf1Δ/pREP-Gaf1 strains exhibited negligible levels of iodine staining and FM value (<0.01%) in the absence of thiamine, but moderate levels of iodine staining and FM values (23–25%) in the presence of thiamine (Figure 3B). On the contrary, the spots of h90 WT/pREP42 and h90 gaf1Δ/pREP42 strains were stained dark brown with iodine vapor and exhibited high FM values (69–85%) after 3-d cultivation regardless of the presence of thiamine, indicating luxuriant sporulation under nitrogen-starved conditions. Together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of gaf1+ leads to a significant reduction of sporulation efficiency.10.1371/journal.pone.0042409.g003Figure 3Overexpression of gaf1+ results in reduction of sporulation efficiency. Cells and colonies of the homothallic (h90) strains, WT(JY4)/pREP42, gaf1Δ(KL211)/pREP42, WT(JY4)/pREP-Gaf1, and gaf1Δ(KL211)/pREP-Gaf1, were analyzed for sporulation by DIC microscopy and iodine staining, respectively. (A) Cells were grown to mid-log phase in EMM2 for 18 h and shifted to EMM-N medium. Samples were taken from the cultures at intervals, and the morphological characteristics of cells were observed by DIC microscopy. Bar, 10 µm. (B) Cells were grown to mid-log phase in EMM2 for 18 h and spotted onto EMM-N plates with (+B1) or without (−B1) 20 µM thiamine. Sporulation was monitored by iodine vapor staining of colonies after 3-d incubation at 30°C. The FM value presented under each panel was determined by observing the cells under a DIC microscope. The values represent the average of at least three independent assays carried out in triplicate. WT denotes the wild-type (gaf1+).Gaf1 controls both the nitrogen starvation- and pheromone-responsive genes To search for a set of genes whose expression is specifically altered in response to the loss of gaf1+, microarray-based transcriptome analysis was performed using the RNA samples from the nitrogen-starved (−N) and unstarved (+N) cells of wild-type (gaf1+, ED668) and gaf1Δ (KL216) strains. A Venn diagram (Figure 4) was constructed from the groups of the genes up-regulated (≥1.5-fold, p<0.05) in unstarved gaf1Δ cells (Group −G), nitrogen-starved wild-type cells (Group −N), and nitrogen-starved gaf1Δ cells (Group −N/−G). One hundred and eighty-three genes were up-regulated in unstarved gaf1Δ cells (Group −G, Table S1). A total of 1,301 and 1,418 genes were up-regulated by nitrogen starvation in wild-type (Group −N, Table S2), and gaf1Δ cells (Group −N/−G, Table S3).10.1371/journal.pone.0042409.g004Figure 4Effect of gaf1Δ mutation and nitrogen starvation on the global gene expression profiles of S. pombe. RNA samples from the nitrogen-starved (−N) and unstarved (+N) cells of wild-type (gaf1+, ED668) and gaf1Δ (KL216) strains were used for the transcriptome analysis with the GeneChip Yeast Genome 2.0 Array. A Venn diagram is constructed from the lists of the genes up-regulated (≥1.5-fold, p<0.05) in unstarved gaf1Δ cells (Group −G, Table S1), nitrogen-starved wild-type cells (Group −N, Table S2), and nitrogen-starved gaf1Δ cells (Group −N/−G, Table S3). The overlapping and non-overlapping portions of the three groups (Group −G, −N, and −N/−G) are designated as Subgroup A to G. The lists of the genes included in Subgroup A–G are provided in Tables S4, S5, S6, S7, S8 S9, and S10, respectively, in the Supporting Information. The overlapping and non-overlapping portions of the three groups (Group −G, −N, and −N/−G) are designated as Subgroup A to G (Figure 4), which enables more detailed clustering of the genes of interest. Approximately 63% (116 genes) of the members of Group −G were up-regulated by both gaf1Δ mutation and nitrogen starvation (Subgroup B+G, Table S5 and S10), while most of the remainders (61 genes) were up-regulated solely by gaf1Δ mutation (Subgroup A, Table S4). Therefore, it is suggested that Gaf1 down-regulates the basal expression levels of the nitrogen starvation-responsive genes included in Subgroup B+G. Although majorities of the members in Group −N and −N/−G were shown to be up-regulated by nitrogen starvation in both gaf1Δ and wild-type cells (1,043 genes, Subgroup D+G, Table S7 and S10), a considerable portions of them were up-regulated by nitrogen starvation in either gaf1Δ (375 genes, Subgroup E+F, Table S8 and S9) or wild-type cells (262 genes, Subgroup B+C, Table S5 and S6). A considerable number of the genes of Subgroup B+G are up-regulated during mating and sporulation (the Sanger Centre Database; http://www.genedb.org/genedb/pombe) [38]: genes involved in nitrogen and/or pheromone response such as mei2+, ste11+, spk1+, ppk33+, ste4+, gpa1+, mfm1+, map1+, map2+ and map3+; genes function in double-strand break (DSB) formation, meiotic recombination, and/or nuclear segregation such as mug8+, mug14+, mug24+, mug55+, mug112+, mug133+, rec24+, bqt2+, and moa1+ [39]; genes encoding permeases (5 genes) and transporters (15 genes) for amino acids, sugars, urea, and other nutrients; and 5 wtf genes belonging to Tf transposon-containing sequences that are transcribed during meiosis. Taken together, it is suggested that deletion of gaf1+ may result in cellular physiology similar to one induced by nitrogen starvation and, accordingly, that Gaf1 plays an important role in both nitrogen starvation and mating response. Furthermore, by comparing our data with the result of microarray analysis using the wild-type, Ste11-overexpressing, and ste11Δ strains [40], we found that 25 genes among those induced by gaf1Δ mutation are included in the list of the 61 Ste11 target genes (Table 3). Among the genes exhibiting increased expression in gaf1Δ cells, 10 genes including mei2+, spk1+, and ste11+ were up-regulated even under unstarved conditions (Subgroup G), while the remainders (15 genes) including ran1+, tht1+ and ste6+ were induced only under nitrogen-starved conditions (Subgroup D+E). This result supports the speculation that ste11+ is possibly a direct target of Gaf1 that negatively regulates its expression at the transcriptional level.10.1371/journal.pone.0042409.t003Table 3List of the Ste11 target genes up-regulated by gaf1Δ mutation.Expression ratioaSubgroupSystematic No.GeneDescription (GeneDB)(G)bSPAC27D7.03cmei2+RNA-binding protein involved in meiosis4.0743.749.30SPAC32A11.01mug8+conserved fungal protein2.275.824.25SPAC31G5.09cspk1+MAP kinase1.9536.4623.90SPBC32C12.02ste11+transcription factor1.765.873.10SPBC359.06mug14+adducing1.7382.7645.98SPAC11E3.06map1+MADS-box transcription factor1.7211.776.14SPBC19C2.04cubp11+ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase1.725.073.84SPBC24C6.06gpa1+G-protein alpha subunit1.7011.547.32SPAC1565.04cste4+adaptor protein1.6910.875.41SPCC162.10ppk33+serine/threonine protein kinase1.5346.3530.03(D+E)cSPAC1F5.09cshk2+PAK-related kinase1.2720.7253.30SPCC1442.01ste6+guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor0.987.4015.76SPAC1093.06cdhc1+dynein heavy chain0.301.4715.66SPAC23E2.03cste7+meiotic suppressor protein1.1911.0515.28SPBC19C2.05ran1+serine/threonine protein kinase1.185.386.88SPCC1393.07cmug4+sequence orphan1.171.975.57SPAC31G5.07conjugation protein (predicted)0.891.524.45SPBC354.08cDUF221 family protein0.360.924.07SPBC2D10.06rep1+MBF transcription factor complex subunit0.922.003.36SPAC13C5.03tht1+nuclear membrane protein involved in karyogamy1.040.623.01SPAC1F5.08cyam8+calcium transport protein1.071.552.65SPAC27E2.07pvg2+galactose residue biosynthesis protein1.211.592.48SPAPB2B4.03cig2+cyclin0.801.092.39SPAC31G5.10eta2+Myb family protein1.041.412.22SPBP4H10.11clcf2+long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase0.751.022.08a Relative expression of the genes was measured by microarray assay in the nitrogen-starved (−N) and unstarved (+N) cells of wild-type (ED668) and gaf1Δ (KL216) strains. Unstarved (+N) cells were prepared from the mid-log phase cultures in EMM2. Nitrogen-starved (−N) cells were prepared by shifting the mid-log phase cells to EMM-N for 4 h as described in Materials and Methods.b Genes up-regulated by gaf1Δ mutation under both nitrogen-starved and unstarved conditions (Subgroup G, p<0.05).c Genes up-regulated by gaf1Δ mutation only under nitrogen starved conditions (Subgroup D+E, p<0.05).ste11+ is epistatic to gaf1+ Epistasis analysis was performed to determine whether Gaf1 functions in the same pathway as Ste11, a key transcription factor for sexual development [12]. Pre-grown cells of the homothallic haploid strains, h90 gaf1Δ, h90 ste11Δ, and h90 gaf1Δ ste11Δ, were spotted on both EMM2 and EMM-N plates and the sporulation efficiencies were monitored after 3 d. The FM value of h90 gaf1Δ reached approximately 85% on EMM-N and 24% on EMM2, but h90 ste11Δ and h90 gaf1Δ ste11Δ cells, and the h+ ste11Δ×h− gaf1Δ mating mixture exhibited negligible levels of sporulation efficiencies even on EMM-N (Table 2). Therefore, the phenotype of the gaf1Δ mutation, i.e., accelerated initiation of sporulation and elevated sporulation efficiency, is masked by the ste11Δ mutation, causing impaired sporulation. Thus, ste11+ is epistatic to gaf1+ with respect to sporulation efficiency, and furthermore, gaf1+ functions upstream of ste11+ in the signaling pathway governing sexual development.Expression of ste11+ is accelerated and increased in gaf1Δ cells To test whether gaf1+ is responsible for the transcriptional regulation of ste11+, we analyzed the expression of ste11+ under both nitrogen-starved and normal conditions in gaf1Δ and wild-type strains by Northern blot analysis. Under normal conditions, gaf1Δ cells showed increased level of ste11+ compared to wild-type cells (Figure 5A). When the wild-type cells were exposed to nitrogen starvation, the level of gaf1+ transcript increased considerably during the first 6 h of nitrogen starvation, followed by a subsequent decline. Unexpectedly, the levels of ste11+ transcript in both the wild-type and gaf1Δ cells harvested from the nitrogen-starved cultures at the time point of 0 h were considerably higher than those in the corresponding cells from the unstarved culture, which might be due to the very short exposure of the cells to EMM-N medium followed by washing with distilled water. This result is similar to that observed in the previous study conducted by other research group [41]. Therefore, we adopted the data from the unstarved cells of corresponding strains cultivated in EMM2 for 18 h, rather than those from the nitrogen-starved cells sampled at the time point of 0 h, as references. As shown in Figure 5A, the amount of ste11+ transcript increased at a much slower rate than that of gaf1+ transcript, and it did not reach its highest level until at least 9 h after the transfer. The level of ste11+ transcript in gaf1Δ cells, however, increased steeply up to the plateau within 3 h and was maintained during the following 6 h. The expression of ste11+ was also monitored by assaying the ectopic expression of Ste11(p)-lacZ hybrid gene in wild-type and gaf1Δ strains carrying the pJLC-Ste11(p)-LacZ plasmid. In accordance with the result of Northern blotting, the expression of Ste11(p)-lacZ was higher in gaf1Δ cells than in wild-type cells under unstarved conditions (Figure 5B). When cells were subjected to nitrogen starvation, the expression of Ste11(p)-lacZ was induced more rapidly in gaf1Δ cells than in wild-type cells. These results suggest that deletion of gaf1+ causes accelerated induction of ste11+ expression under nitrogen-starved conditions and increased ste11+ expression even under unstarved conditions.10.1371/journal.pone.0042409.g005Figure 5Deletion of gaf1+ results in accelerated induction of ste11+ expression under nitrogen-starved conditions. (A) Northern blot analysis of ste11+ and gaf1+ mRNA from wild-type and gaf1Δ cells exposed to nitrogen starvation. Cells of wild-type (972) and gaf1Δ (KL230) strains pre-grown in EMM2 (+N) were shifted to EMM-N (−N) and cultured with constant shaking. At indicated time points, cells were harvested and washed twice with distilled water, and total RNAs were extracted from the cells. RNA blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled PCR-amplified gaf1+ and ste11+ probes. For internal control, all blots were stripped and subsequently rehybridized with 32P-labeled actin-specific probe (act1+). (B) β-Galactosidase reporter assay for analysis of ste11+ expression in wild-type and gaf1Δ cells subjected to nitrogen starvation. Cells of wild-type (ED665) and gaf1Δ (KL240) strains carrying pJLC-Ste11(p)-LacZ were cultivated to mid-log phase in EMM2 (+N) and shifted to EMM-N (−N). At indicated time points, cells were harvested and washed twice with distilled water, and the level of ste11+ expression was estimated by measuring the activity of β-galactosidase in each sample. Values are the mean ± standard error of three independent experiments carried out in triplicate, n = 9. *, p<0.01; **, p<0.05 (two-tailed Student's t-test, versus wild-type). WT denotes the wild-type (gaf1+).Gaf1 protein binds to the promoter region of ste11+ We performed EMSA to address whether Gaf1 can directly bind to the promoter region of ste11+. The upstream probe (PA), encompassing the region from −835 to −227 of the ste11+ promoter, was amplified by PCR and end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Figure 6A). A DNA-protein complex was observed in the reaction mixture containing the 32P-labeled PA probe and the recombinant GST-Gaf1 (Figure 6B, lanes 2 and 5). The DNA-protein complex was specifically reduced in the presence of 50- and 100-fold molar excess of cold PA competitor probe (Figure 6B, lanes 3 and 4), but not in the presence of 50- or 100-fold molar excess of cold PB competitor (Figure 6B, lanes 6 and 7). This suggests that the Gaf1 protein specifically binds to a cis-element contained in the upstream region (from −828 to −227) of the ste11+ promoter.10.1371/journal.pone.0042409.g006Figure 6Gaf1 protein specifically binds to the GATA binding motif of ste11+ promoter in vitro.

Restriction sites: Sp, SphI; N, NdeI; RV, EcoRV. (B) Search for Gaf1-binding region in ste11+ promoter by EMSA. GST-Gaf1 protein (1 µg) was incubated with labeled PA probe containing the 0.6-kb upstream region of ste11+ promoter in the absence (lanes 2 and 5) or presence of excess cold competitor, PA (lane 3, 50-fold; lane 4, 100-fold) or PB (lane 6, 50-fold; lane 7, 100-fold). (C) Analysis of Gaf1 binding to the GATA motif of ste11+ promoter by EMSA. GST-Gaf1 protein (lane 3, 0.1 µg; lanes 4–6, 1 µg) was incubated with labeled PA probe in the absence (lanes 3 and 4) or presence of 100-fold excess of cold competitor PM (lanes 5) or PW (lanes 6). (D) Mutational dissection of the Gaf1-binding GATA motif of ste11+ promoter by EMSA. Varying amounts of GST-Gaf1 protein (lane 3, 0.1 µg; lane 4, 0.2 µg; lane 5, 0.5 µg; lanes 6, 7, 11, and 12, 1 µg) were incubated with labeled PW oligonucleotide probe in the absence (lanes 3 and 4) or presence of 100-fold excess of cold competitor PM (lanes 5) or PW (lanes 6). Mock reaction mixtures without GST-Gaf1 or with GST protein were used as negative controls in (B)–(D). The closed and open arrow heads in (B)–(D) represent shifted bands and free probes, respectively. We also performed competition experiments using cold oligonucleotide probes spanning base pairs −385 to −351: PW containing a canonical GATA motif and PM containing mutations in the GATA motif (Figure 6A). The DNA-protein complex between the 32P-labeled PA probe and GST-Gaf1 protein was diminished by the addition of 100-fold molar excess cold PW (Figure 6C, lanes 4 and 6), but not by a similar amount of cold PM (Figure 6C, lanes 4 and 5). Accordingly, the amount of PW-GST-Gaf1 complex increased in proportion to the amount of GST-Gaf1 (Figure 6D, lanes 3–6) and was diminished to the basal level by addition of 100-fold molar excess of cold PW (Figure 6C, lane 6). The PM probe did not produce any detectable amount of DNA-protein complex with GST-Gaf1 (Figure 6D, lane 10) or exhibit competition against the PW probe to GST-Gaf1 even at a 100-fold molar excess (Figure 6D, lane 11). These results reflect that the canonical GATA motif from −371 to −366 in the promoter of ste11+ (Figure 6A) is the target sequence of the Gaf1 protein. It is thus suggested that the GATA motif in ste11+ promoter functions as a cis element to delay and attenuate the induction of ste11+ expression via the interaction with Gaf1.Discussion The S. pombe protein Ste11, which activates a number of genes required for mating and meiosis, is a pivotal regulator of sexual differentiation induced by nutrient starvation or environmental stress [12]. In the present study, we identified Gaf1, an S. pombe GATA factor, as a negative regulator of ste11+ expression. Deletion of gaf1+ caused no growth defects under normal conditions. However, under nitrogen-starvation, it led to reduced mitotic growth (Figure 1), accelerated entrance into G1 (Figure 2), and elevated mating and sporulation efficiency (Table 2). Overexpression of gaf1+ resulted in a remarkable reduction of sporulation efficiency under nitrogen-starved conditions (Figure 3). It seems likely that Gaf1 functions as a modulator of the mitosis-meiosis transition, delaying the entrance of growing cells into the meiotic cycle during the initial stages of nitrogen starvation and signaling the optimal time for promoting sexual development. The delay in G1-arrest and subsequent sporulation may provide a safety mechanism allowing cells to revert to vegetative growth when nutrient availability again becomes favorable [6], [16], [42], [43]. In accordance with the present result, overexpression of tor2+ encoding the TOR protein kinase Tor2 strongly represses mating, meiosis and sporulation efficiency, whereas its inactivation has the opposite effect, leading to cell differentiation regardless of nutritional conditions [11]. In S. cerevisiae, it has been shown that Tor kinase and GATA transcription factor are involved in nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR), a regulatory event in which transcription of certain genes is down-regulated by a good nitrogen source such as glutamine but up-regulated by a poor nitrogen source such as proline [44]. Therefore, the involvement of TOR kinase and GATA transcription factor in nitrogen signaling may be a widely conserved phenomenon among various organisms. Microarray analysis of the global gene expression profiles in gaf1Δ and wild-type cells under nitrogen-starved and unstarved conditions enabled us to search for a cluster of genes controlled by the action of Gaf1. Approximately 63% of the genes induced by the deletion of gaf1+ under normal conditions (Subgroup B+G, Figure 4) overlap with those induced by nitrogen starvation in wild-type cells. In addition, many of the Subgroup B+G genes are identified to be induced during mating and sporulation [38]. Thus, it is likely that Gaf1 plays an important role not only in nitrogen signaling pathway but also in mating response. In accordance with the present result, recent microarray analysis using temperature-sensitive tor2 mutants revealed that a total of 151 of 194 genes induced by the loss of Tor2 function are included in the list of roughly 1,000 genes found to be induced by nitrogen starvation in S. pombe [45]. This result pointed to an important role that Tor2 plays in nitrogen starvation and mating response. Interestingly, we also found that 13 genes among those induced by the deletion of gaf1+ overlap with those induced by the loss of Tor2 function, suggesting that the two genes might be involve in the same signaling pathway activated by nitrogen starvation. Thus, it would be interesting to determine the relationship between gaf1+ and tor2+ genes. Comparison of our microarray data with the genome-wide view of Ste11 target genes reported previously [40] enabled us to speculate that ste11+ is a strong candidate for a direct transcriptional target of Gaf1 (Table 3). Especially, it is noteworthy that the genes involved in Ras/MAPK signaling pathway stimulated by pheromone such as gpa1+, ste4+, spk1+, ste11+, and mei2+ are transcriptionally induced in response to the loss of gaf1+ function under normal conditions. In addition, this finding is in agreement with the observation that deletion of gaf1+ causes accelerated entrance of cells into meiotic cell cycle (Figure 2) and elevated mating and sporulation efficiency on exposure to nitrogen starvation (Table 2). In accordant with the result of microarray analysis, cells of the gaf1Δ ste11Δ strain were completely defective in mating and sporulation (Table 2), indicating that ste11+ is epistatic to gaf1+. Deletion of gaf1+ not only increases the expression of ste11+ in unstarved cells but also accelerates the induction of ste11+ transcription in nitrogen-starved cells (Figure 5). In addition, the result of EMSA provides compelling evidence that Gaf1 binds to the canonical GATA motif (5′-HGATAR-3′) spanning from −371 to −366 in the promoter of ste11+ to attenuate and delay its expression (Figure 5). Thus, it becomes evident that Gaf1 functions as a negative regulator of ste11+ transcription, via direct interaction with the GATA motif in the ste11+ promoter. The expression of ste11+ is regulated directly by two transcription factors, Rst2 and Ste11, that bind to the upstream activating sequence (UASst; 5′-CCCCTC-3′) and the T-rich box (TR box; 5′-TTCTTTGTTY-3′) in the ste11+ promoter, respectively [4]. No other proteins that either activate or repress the transcription of ste11+ through direct binding to its promoter had been identified. Our research indicates that Gaf1 provides the prime example for negative regulation of ste11+ transcription through direct binding to a cis-acting motif of its promoter. Figure 7 shows a simplified view of the proposed role of Gaf1 in the nitrogen-signaling pathways governing the expression of ste11+ and consequent sexual differentiation in S. pombe together with the cAMP-dependent PKA and stress-activated MAPK pathways determined previously. We found in the present study that nitrogen starvation causes induction of gaf1+ expression, and Gaf1, in turn, represses the expression of ste11+ via direct interaction with its promoter. Starvation of carbon or nitrogen source leads to decrease in the level of cAMP and subsequent drop of PKA activity, which consequently induces expression of ste11+ through the activation of Rst2 that can bind to the promoter region of ste11+ [4], [7], [46]. Nitrogen starvation also causes activation of the stress-activated MAPK pathway including Wis4, Win1, Wis1, and Sty1 [14], [15], leading to activation of Atf1 by phosphorylation [16], [47], [48]. Activated Atf1, in turn, forms a complex with another cAMP response element-binding protein Pcr1 to yield an Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimeric transcription factor, which is also required for expression of ste11+ [5], [6], [49]. It has not yet been determined whether the Atf1-Pcr1 complex directly regulates the expression of ste11+ or not. However, it has been reported that the Atf1-Pcr1 heterodimer directly activates the expression of cgs2+ encoding a phosphodiesterase that has a major role in regulating the single cAMP-dependent PKA pathway [3]. In addition, phosphodiesterase is most likely stimulated by PKA activity to create a feedback mechanism [50]. Thus there exists a direct connection between the MAPK and PKA pathways mediated by the action of Atf1-Pcr1 complex. It remains to be determined whether the expression of gaf1+ is subject to the control of either the cAMP-dependent PKA or the stress-activated MAPK pathway.10.1371/journal.pone.0042409.g007Figure 7Schematic diagram showing the proposed function of Gaf1 in the nitrogen-signaling pathways in S. pombe. Nitrogen starvation causes induction of gaf1+ expression, and Gaf1, in turn, represses the expression of ste11+ via direct interaction with its promoter. It has been previously known that nitrogen starvation leads to the activation of Rst2 via the cAMP-dependent PKA pathway [14], [15] as well as Atf1-Pcr1 via the Sty1 MAPK pathway [3], [5], [6], [14]–[16], [47]–[49], consequently resulting in induction of ste11+ expression. In addition, phosphodiesterase is most likely stimulated by PKA activity to create a feedback mechanism [50]. The pathway addressed in this study is shown in thick lines, and other paths previously determined are shown in thin lines. Activation and inhibition are indicated by arrows and crossing bars, respectively. Dotted lines indicate pathways remained to be fully determined.Supporting InformationTable S1 List of the genes up-regulated in unstarved (+N) gaf1Δ cells (Group −G).

Discovery of Src and EGFR, and Their Crosstalk Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation was initially discovered as the catalytic property of the viral oncogene product v-Src [1,2]. Its cellular homologue, namely, the protein product of the c-Src gene (Src), also possesses the activity of a protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK). While the activity of v-Src is deregulated (i.e., constitutively activated) and thus contributes to malignant cell transformation, the activity of the normal cellular Src is usually negatively regulated and its signal-dependent transient activation contributes to physiological cell responses (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, cell motility) [3–5]. Src is also recognized as the first example of a cytoplasmic as well as membrane-associated PTK, whose structural organization is shared by several other proteins, collectively termed the Src family PTKs [6]. Src and other Src family PTKs are expressed ubiquitously (e.g., Src, Fyn and Yes) or in certain specific tissues (e.g., Lck in lymphoid cells), exerting both common and specific functions. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), on the other hand, was identified as the first example of a transmembrane receptor/PTK whose activation depends upon the binding of extracellular ligands (EGF and other EGF-like ligands, such as transforming growth factor-α, heregulin, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor) to and dimerization of the receptor molecules [7] (Figure 1). EGFR also constitutes a family of proteins, named the HER family in humans, which includes EGFR/erbB1/HER1, erbB2/HER2/Neu, erbB3/HER3 and erbB4/HER4, which can form homologous (e.g., EGFR-EGFR) as well as heterologous dimers (e.g., EGFR-HER2) exerting specific functions as highly specific ligand-receptor interaction [8]. It is also known that v-erbB, a product of avian erythroblastosis virus AEV-H, is the oncogenic version of EGFR/erbB1, in which the N-terminal ligand-binding sequence is almost entirely truncated and thus the PTK activity of the protein is deregulated [7,9]. The function of EGF and EGFR was initially documented in epidermal cellular physiology; however, later studies showed that they are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of cells and tissues, and contribute to a variety of cellular functions [10]. After the discovery of Src and EGFR, much work has focused on understanding how PTKs and their substrates act as a trigger of cellular functions, including malignant cell transformation. These studies include analysis of physical and/or functional interactions, that is, crosstalk, between Src and transmembrane receptor/PTKs such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor [11], Trk/nerve growth factor receptor [12], colony-stimulating factor receptor [13], erbB2/HER2/Neu [14], and EGFR [15,16]. In particular, the interaction of Src and EGFR has raised much interest because both are ubiquitously expressed and their co-overexpression and/or mutations have often been found in cancer cells of humans and model animals.1.2. Auto- and Trans-Phosphorylation of EGFR Soon after the molecular identification and cDNA cloning of EGFR performed in the mid-1980s, several tyrosine residues that reside in the carboxyl-terminal tail were identified as the autophosphorylation sites in activated EGFR (for reviews, see [17]) (Figure 1). In addition, several research groups demonstrated the importance of these phosphotyrosine residues in EGF-induced signal transduction, namely, as docking sites for phosphotyrosine-binding adaptor proteins such as Grb2 and Shc, in the early 1990s [18]. We demonstrated for the first time the occurrence of the EGFR-Y845 phosphorylation in 1995 [19], and the Parsons group demonstrated for the first time the physiological as well as pathological importance of the Y845 phosphorylation in 1999 [20,21]. Ligand-activated EGFR undergoes autophosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues, most of which are located in the C-terminal non-catalytic sequence; they include Y992, Y1068, Y1086, Y1148, and Y1173 [7,22–26]. Later studies showed that tyrosine residues in EGFR could also be phosphorylated by other kinases including Src (Y845, for detail see below; Y891 and Y920 [27]; Y1045 [28]; Y1101 [20]; Y1173 [29]). The phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in EGFR was also found: it included T654, T669, S967, S971, S1002, and S1046/S1047 [15,16,30–32]. Several lines of evidence indicate that the autophosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking sites for a variety of signaling molecules that contain a phosphotyrosine-binding sequence (i.e., Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine-binding domains). On the other hand, serine/threonine phosphorylation acts as a regulatory mechanism for the dimerization, catalytic activity, and/or turnover of the protein [8]. In many protein kinases so far identified and biochemically characterized, a tyrosine and/or serine/threonine residue(s) in a segment, which resides between kinase subdomains VII and VIII (often called the “activation segment”), serves as an autophosphorylation and/or trans-phosphorylation site(s) [33,34], a well-known example of which is Y416/Y418 in the chicken/human Src protein. However, a homologous tyrosine residue that is present in the activation segment of EGFR, that is, Y845 (or Y869, if the N-terminal signal sequence of 24 amino acids is included) (Figure 1), was not identified as the phosphorylation site in the early years of EGFR study. Against this background, initial characterization of Y845 phosphorylation was made by in vitro kinase assays using a synthetic peptide straddling Y845 (E-E-K-E-Y845-H-A-E) and mutated forms of it [35]. Subsequently, Gotoh et al. [36] made an initial evaluation of the role of Y845 in EGFR function, by which the Y845F mutant of EGFR was shown to be able to transform NIH3T3 cells and undergo autophosphorylation. This result suggests that, at least in the NIH3T3 cell system, Y845 is dispensable for cellular functions regulated by EGFR. However, a growing body of knowledge indicates that Y845, through its trans-phosphorylation rather than autophosphorylation, plays a pivotal role in several aspects of cellular functions involving EGFR, a main mediator of which is the tyrosine kinase Src that catalyzes the phosphorylation of Y845.1.3. Discovery of Y845 Phosphorylation of EGFR by Src Intracellular communication between EGFR and Src, which contributes to cancer malignancy, was first demonstrated in the late 1980s. Parsons and others showed that EGF-dependent protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and mitogenic cell responses are augmented in cells overexpressing Src [16,37,38]. At this time, however, phosphorylation of Y845 by Src was unknown. Later, Wasilenko et al. [39] made the first demonstration that Src is capable of phosphorylating EGFR on unknown tyrosine residue(s). In this work, trypsin-digested phosphopeptides were analyzed in cells expressing both EGFR and Src, and thus the identification of phosphorylated Y845 was not made. The first evidence showing that Src directly phosphorylates EGFR on Y845 was provided by our work [19], where in vitro phosphorylated EGFR in the presence of Src was analyzed by tryptic digestion and two-dimensional electrophoresis, by which the identities of EGFR-derived phosphopeptides and a synthetic peptide containing phosphorylated Y845 were evaluated. In addition, we showed that Y845 phosphorylation also occurs in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, where a fraction of EGFR and Src constitutes a physical complex via the activation segment of Src [19,40] that we called the inter-DFG-APE region [33,41]. At almost the same time, Parsons and others demonstrated that phosphopeptide maps, analyzed after preparation from C3H10T1/2 murine fibroblast-derived 5H cells overexpressing Src, contain an Src-dependent phosphopeptide that is suggested to contain Y845 [42]. Later, the same group showed that EGFR is phosphorylated on Y845 and Y1101 in 5H cells [20]. Stover et al. also showed that EGFR is phosphorylated on two novel tyrosine residues in DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells: in this case, Y891 and Y920, but not Y845, were identified [27]. These studies suggest that EGFR and Src communicate with each other by Src-dependent phosphorylation of novel tyrosine residues (for review, see [4,43–46]).2. Y845 Phosphorylation and Cancer Cell Functions2.1. Cooperation of EGFR and Src in Cancer Cells Involving Y845 Phosphorylation As described above, elevated levels of Src and EGFR are often found in a variety of cancer cells [42]. Search of the physiological roles played by these two overexpressed PTKs has demonstrated a breakthrough finding that they exert synergism in promoting as well as maintaining cancerous cell growth, the main phenomenon implicated in which is Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR by Src [21]. It was shown that the activity of Src is required for C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cells overexpressing EGFR to undergo cell transformation. As opposed to the case using an NIH3T3 cell system ([36], see above), expression of Y845F mutant EGFR in this cell line leads to a failure of DNA synthesis in response to not only EGF but also serum and lysophosphatidic acid, indicating that the Y845F mutant has a dominant-negative effect on the cellular function of EGFR [21]. In this case, however, the Y845F mutant is still capable of interacting with Src. In addition, it was demonstrated that neither stimulation of the kinase activity of EGFR nor that of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was affected by the expression of the Y845F mutant, suggesting that an unknown, non-canonical signaling pathway contributes to the alteration of EGFR molecular function, DNA synthesis, and malignant cell proliferation under the control of Y845 phosphorylation [20,21]. Subsequent studies using breast cancer and other types of human cancer cells demonstrated that the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein (STAT) is a possible mediator of the Y845 phosphorylation-dependent synergism of EGFR and Src [47–49]. In breast cancer cells, STAT5b was identified as a prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated protein and that expression of the Y845F mutant of EGFR has an inhibitory effect on this event [47]. The importance of STAT5b is further demonstrated by the fact that the tyrosine phosphorylation-defective mutant of STAT5b is inhibitory to DNA synthesis and proliferation in cells expressing EGFR and Src [47,50,51]. On the other hand, STAT1 and 3, but not STAT5b, have been identified as tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in EGF-stimulated A431 cells [49], in which the physical interaction of EGFR and Src involving Y845 phosphorylation has been demonstrated [19,40,48,52]. In this system, it has been shown that high concentrations of EGF or the expression of the Shc adaptor protein p52/p66, a direct regulator of the Src activity [48,53], promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which is accompanied by the induction of p21waf1[54,55]. The application of a Src-specific inhibitor PP2 or an anti-Y845 phospho-specific antibody into the cells results in decreases in the EGF-dependent phosphorylation of STAT1/3 and in the extent of p21waf1 induction [49], suggesting that Src-dependent Y845 phosphorylation serves as a pro-apoptotic signal in this system. The group of Parsons also showed that cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (CoxII) is an alternative binding partner of the phosphorylated Y845 of EGFR [50]. CoxII is a mitochondrion-associated protein that acts as a component of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Mitochondria are well known as the center for energy metabolism as well as survival machinery. The importance of Y845 phosphorylation and CoxII engagement of EGFR in mitochondria is suggested by the fact that wild-type EGFR, but not Y845 mutant of EGFR, translocates to mitochondria where it physically associates with CoxII, and that such interactions contribute to an increase in survival of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells under serum-deprived or adriamycin-treated “pro-apoptotic” conditions [56,57]. A growing body of knowledge indicates that Src can also be localized to mitochondria [58–64] (for review, see [65]) and that Src may be responsible for maintaining cell survival through phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins [66], suggesting that EGFR and Src communicate not only in the plasma membrane but also in cytoplasmic organelles. In addition, a mutant form of EGFR expressed in glioma cells, named de2-7EGFR/EGFRvIII, was shown to translocate to mitochondria in an Src-dependent manner and to be phosphorylated on Y845 [67]. More recently, Miyake and Parsons [68] have shown that choline kinase α, an enzyme that converts choline to phosphocholine in the phosphatidylcholine synthesis and whose overexpression correlates with poor prognosis, high grade and increased aggressiveness in some types of human cancer, interacts directly with EGFR, is tyrosine-phosphorylated in an Src-dependent manner, and contributes to breast cancer cell proliferation. However, the importance of Y845 phosphorylation in this process is not known.2.2. Y845 Phosphorylation in Several Types of Cancer Cells In hepatocellular carcinoma, where transmembrane 4 L six family member 5 (TM4SF5), a tetraspanin-type protein, is implicated in their migration and invasion, a high incidence of Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR was demonstrated [69]. Later studies by Jung et al. [70] showed that TM4SF5 is responsible for the recruitment of negatively regulated Src to the vicinity of EGFR, by which Src becomes activated and phosphorylates Y845 of EGFR, and cells acquire the ability to form invasive protrusions that involve actin and cortactin interactions. A similar mechanism of activation of the Src-EGFR pathway was also reported in breast epithelial cells, where expression of translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) results in a release of inactive Src from its interaction with Na+, K+-ATPase α subunit, so that Src becomes activated and induces cell transformation involving Y845 phosphorylation [71,72]. EGFR activation is often accompanied by the redistribution of EGFR from the plasma membrane to intracellular vesicles [73]. This event involves endocytosis of the receptor via clathrin-coated vesicles and endosome formation. Such endocytic internalization of EGFR can be augmented by overexpression [74] and temperature shift-dependent activation of Src (ts/v-Src) [75] in C3H10T1/2 murine fibroblasts and MDCK/tsLA31 cells, respectively. In the latter case, the occurrence of Y845 and Y1173 phosphorylation, in conjunction with the endosomal distribution of EGFR, is demonstrated [75]. There is a specific type of EGFR mutation, called de2-7EGFR or EGFRvIII, whose expression is often found in glioma or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In this case, Src-dependent phosphorylation of Y845 seems to be important for the survival and proliferation of glioma cells through its involvement in the stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism under low-glucose conditions [67]. Actually, mitochondrial localization of this EGFR mutant was shown to depend upon Y845 phosphorylation. In another study using U373MG cells, another type of GBM cells, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) was shown to interact with EGFRvIII and to be important for Y845 phosphorylation and sustained ERK activation in this cell system [76]. Huang et al. [77] showed that, by mutating Y845 or two other tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Y1148 and Y1173), these specific tyrosine residues in EGFRvIII are required for suppressing the ERK activity, which acts against the cell proliferation of EGFRvIII-expressing U87MG glioblastoma cells. Src also participates in cancer cell functions involving the other family member of the EGFR and/or its phosphorylation on a tyrosine residue that is analogous to the EGFR Y845. In murine fibroblasts, C3H10T1/2, and human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-361, where high levels of expression of erbB2 (naturally overexpressed) and erbB3 (ectopically or naturally overexpressed) are evident, mutual interaction between erbB2 and erbB3 takes place. Such erbB2-erbB3 interaction was shown to be responsible for the erbB3-dependent (i.e., the erbB3 ligand heregulin-dependent) anchorage-independent growth and cell motility in a Src-dependent manner [78]. In MBA-MB-361 cells, the heregulin-dependent cell functions involve the phosphorylation of erbB2 on Y877, a tyrosine residue analogous to EGFR Y845 [78]. Thus, Src-dependent phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue that resides in the activation segment is a phenomenon that occurs commonly for at least two EGFR family proteins, EGFR and erbB2. The incidence of EGFR-erbB2 interaction is also implicated as a prognostic parameter for high malignancy and drug resistance of breast cancer cells, and it is also associated with the occurrence of Y845 phosphorylation [79].2.3. Y845 Phosphorylation as a Diagnostic Marker for Cancer Treatment In the search for the molecular basis of drug resistance in patients with non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), Y845 and some other phosphorylation sites such as Y1045 and Y1068 have been identified as prominently phosphorylated sites in many gefitinib-resistant EGFR mutants [80,81]. Chung et al. [82] showed that Src-dependent Y845 phosphorylation in some mutated EGFR is critically important for the malignancy of NSCLCs. On the other hand, evaluation of the effect of gefitinib using human squamous cell carcinoma cells, UMSCC-1, demonstrated that this drug, in combination with gemcitabine (2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine), suppresses the phosphorylation of EGFR Y845 and arrests the cell cycle at the S or G1 phase, which leads to the increased incidence of apoptosis in the cells [83]. The occurrence of the EGFR mutation and its correlation with the appearance and/or the subcellular localization of Y845 phosphorylation have been examined in NSCLCs, adenocarcinomas [84], and breast cancer [85]. Sonnweber et al. [86] have shown that, in stage I NSCLCs, Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR, rather than the incidence of EGFRvIII mutation, has independent and highly predictive value for prognosis. In some cases of NSCLC expressing mutant EGFR, gefitinib does not inhibit cell proliferation, but PP2 does, collectively suggesting that gefitinib resistance of the mutant EGFR is due to the Src-dependent modulation of EGFR activity. In NSCLCs, the functional association of Y845 phosphorylation with the extent of autophosphorylation of co-expressing EGFR wild type and mutants (e.g., Y1068) and the sensitivity of the cells to Src-specific inhibitor PP2, have been demonstrated [87]. In breast cancers that are not responsive to EGFR inhibitor therapy, not only Src but also Met, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor that is itself a tyrosine kinase, is implicated in cancer cell malignancy [88]. For example, in SUM229 breast cancer cells, Src activation and Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR depend upon the activity of Met, as judged by the effects of the Met-specific activator (HGF) and inhibitors (SU11274). Crosstalk of Met with the Src/EGFR signaling pathway has also been demonstrated in bladder carcinoma cells, in which serum-independent growth of the cells requires the activation of EGFR and Src, which leads to the phosphorylation of Met on Y1003 [89]. In this case, the phosphorylated Y1003 of Met, rather than the kinase activity of Met, seems to be responsible for the anti-apoptosis and proliferation under serum-starved culture conditions [89,90]. Whether or not Y845 phosphorylation takes place under serum-deprived conditions is unknown. In glioma cells, it has been shown that HGF stimulates the transcription of EGFR ligands such as transforming growth factor α (TGF α) and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), whose inhibitions result in the failure of EGFR activation involving Y845 phosphorylation [91]. Thus, crosstalk between EGFR and Met is, at least in some cases, transcription-dependent. Tamoxifen-resistant variants of MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells are reported to exert Y845 signaling via the activation of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) in response to IGF-II [92]. The anti-invasive effect of oxidized streptolysin O on MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells is characterized by its ability to activate the autophosphorylation of EGFR selectively on tyrosine residues besides Y845, indicating that, in this case, Y845 may not be involved in the anti-cancer malignancy [93]. On the other hand, Y845 phosphorylation has been identified as a diagnostic marker for the inhibitory effect of ipriflavone on osteolytic bone metastasis of the same cells in a nude mouse model [94]. The prognostic value of Y845 phosphorylation has also been examined in oral squamous cell carcinoma; tumors bearing this phosphorylation correlated with a worse prognosis and were poor responders to chemotherapy [95]. In another case, where the effect of cetuximab, an anti-EGFR drug monoclonal antibody, on the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells was evaluated, the drug-induced reduction of the Y845 phosphorylation did not necessarily correlate with the reduction in the growth potential of the cells [96], demonstrating that, under certain conditions, the Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR is dispensable for the EGFR-dependent cancer cell malignancy. In colorectal cancer cells, sensitivity to an anti-EGFR drug (i.e., gefitinib) can be improved by the pharmacological inhibition of insulin receptor isoform-A [97]. In this case, Y845, Y1068, and Y1173 are employed as diagnostic markers for the active state of EGFR. The anti-tumor effect of gefitinib and anastrozole has been investigated in estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer cells, where the extent of Y845 phosphorylation is used as one of the outcomes of the drug treatments [98]. The anti-cancer pro-apoptotic function of an indole compound, 3,3′-diindolylmethane, toward ovarian cancer cells also involves the suppression of the Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR and the subsequent ERK/MAPK signaling pathway [99]. Specific inhibition of Y845 phosphorylation by the Src-specific inhibitor PP2 was also shown in cervical carcinoma cells HeLa and SiHa [100], and in ionizing irradiation-treated MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells [101]. X-radiation-induced DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes was additionally shown to involve Y845 phosphorylation [102]. Lu et al. [103] have reported the mechanism of resistance to the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab in colorectal cancer that had been made insensitive to this drug by exposure to subeffective doses of cetuximab over an extended period of time. In this system, the inhibition of Src activity and Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR reverses the drug resistance. An alternative explanation for the cetuximab resistance in breast cancer cells was reported by Li et al. [104], who showed that breast tumor kinase (Btk)/protein-tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6), a non-receptor, as well as a non-Src family PTK, which was originally identified in human melanocytes, is highly expressed in most human breast cancers and that Btk/PTK6 seems to be responsible for the Y845 phosphorylation, the retention of which confers the resistance of cancer cells to an anti-EGFR drug, cetuximab. This was the first report describing that a non-Src family PTK can mediate Y845 phosphorylation. Morgan et al. [105] showed that the combined use of the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab or erlotinib with gemcitabine increases the efficacy of radiation of damaging pancreatic cancers. In this case, phosphorylation of Y1173, but not Y845, was shown to be effectively decreased, indicating that Y1173, rather than Y845, is a target of these EGFR kinase inhibitors. In ovarian cancer cells that exhibit resistance to cisplatin therapy, NCX-4016, a nitro-derivative of aspirin, has been reported to inhibit effectively the EGFR signaling involving Y845 and Y992 phosphorylation of the receptor, and the activation of Akt and STAT3 [106]. Similar efficacy to EGFR signaling was also shown with the use of a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, and a cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, exisulind, in the Wistar-Unilever rat prostate cancer model [107]. There are some alternative approaches to evaluate the EGFR Y845-dependent cancer cell conditions. Hudelist et al. [108] have shown that immunocytochemical detection of the phosphorylation of Y845 and other tyrosine residues in EGFR can be useful for predicting the clinical outcome of breast cancer patients undergoing anti-HER2/Neu antibody treatment. Proteomic tools such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and/or liquid chromatography-based protein separation and mass spectrometric determination of the protein structures are broadly used for “unbiased” identification of the molecules that participate in a complex array of the EGF-dependent signaling pathway. Phosphotyrosine-based proteome analysis has been employed in squamous carcinoma cells overexpressing EGFR (HN5) to elucidate the interactive networks involved in EGFR Y845 phosphorylation and activation, leading to the identification of its cross-talk relationship with not only well-characterized proteins, but also poorly described proteins such as desmoplakin3, a progesterone target of adhesion-related proteins [109].3. Y845 Phosphorylation in a Variety of Cellular Functions3.1. Y845 Phosphorylation in Transactivated EGFR In HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, SK-BR-3, endothelin-induced transactivation of EGFR via phosphorylation of Y845 has been demonstrated, and dual targeting of the endothelin and EGFR systems, using atrasentan and trastuzumab, respectively, was shown to be effective in reducing cell proliferation and invasion [110]. In SK-BR-3 cells, it was also shown that macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1, a member of the TGF superfamily, transactivates EGFR and induces Y845 phosphorylation via Src activation [111]. Transactivation of EGFR by β2-adrenergic receptor signaling requires the phosphorylation of Y845 by Src to exert the full range of EGFR activation that is comparable to EGF-induced EGFR activation. In this particular case of transactivation, the priming of the EGFR activity via either the ligand stimulation or the overexpression of the receptor protein is also necessary [112]. Isoproterenol-induced transactivation of EGFR in astrocytes was also shown to involve Src-dependent Y845 phosphorylation; in this case, nanomolar concentrations, but not micromolar concentrations, of isoproterenol activation of β2-adrenergic receptor signaling are the trigger for this functional interaction, the astrocytic consequences of which are morphological differentiation and an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein [113]. Transactivation of EGFR by α2-adrenergic receptor signaling in astrocytes in mature brain also involves Y845 phosphorylation [114]. In glioblastoma cell lines U-1242 MG and U-87 MG, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), has been shown to activate EGFR, as judged by the phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues (including Y845) [115]. In this transactivation system for EGFR, PKCδ-dependent activation of Src, which seems to require PKCδ phosphorylation of Src on serine 12 and/or serine 48, takes place. As has been well appreciated, PKC (namely, classical PKCs such as PKCα, βI/βII, γ)-dependent phosphorylation of EGFR on T654 promotes endocytic disappearance of the receptor from the cell surface and thus acts as an inhibitory signal to EGFR signaling [30,116]. In A431 and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, diacylglycerol kinase θ has been shown to counteract such PKC-dependent inactivation of EGFR, so that Y845 phosphorylation and other signaling events are maintained [117]. Insulin also promotes the transactivation of EGFR, involving the phosphorylation of Y845 and Y1173, but not Y1045, in rat perfused liver or primary hepatocytes [118]. These events, as well as subsequent ERK/MAPK activation, are sensitive to an NKCC1 cation-chloride co-transporter inhibitor, bumetanide, suggesting that insulin-induced swelling of the cells is involved. In fact, low osmolality alone induces EGFR and ERK/MAPK activation. In addition, integrin-dependent signaling (see also below), a known sensing system for osmolality, is implicated in Src activation and Y845 phosphorylation in this system [118].3.2. Reactive Oxygen Species and Y845 Phosphorylation In cultured renal tubular epithelial cells, chronic angiotensin II (AII) exposure-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is reported to involve the phosphorylation of EGFR Y845 and caveolin-1, both of which depend upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced Src activity [119]. This signaling pathway localizes to lipid rafts and serves as a prolonged signaling cue to activate ERKs/MAPKs, which are critical components for EMT, whereas the AII exposure also induces acute signaling that involves the conventional ligand-induced activations of EGFR and ERKs, which seem to be unrelated to the occurrence of AII-induced EMT. In rat vascular smooth muscle cells, SII-angiotensin, a triply mutated angiotensin octapeptide (Ser1, Ile4, Ile8), and AII have been shown to promote ERK/MAPK activation in a manner that depends upon the Src phosphorylation of Y845 of EGFR [120]. The stimulation of dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) by bromocriptine in PC12 cells ectopically expressing D2R (PC12-D2R) also induces transactivation of EGFR involving Src phosphorylation of Y845 and leads to further signaling to the PI3K/Akt pathway, cytoprotective responses against oxidative stresses and anti-apoptotic cell functions [121]. Bombesin and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), both of which are activators for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), also stimulate, in a transactivation-dependent manner, the EGFR signaling involving Y845 phosphorylation in rat-1 cells expressing bombesin/gastrin release hormone receptor (BoR-15) [122]. Src-dependent phosphorylation of caveolin-1 and EGFR Y845 was shown to occur in ionizing radiation-treated human bronchial carcinoma cells, A549. These phosphorylation events seem to occur independently of each other; however, radiation-induced nuclear transport and activation of DNA repair machinery in the cells were shown to require both of these events [123,124]. UVB radiation was shown to promote the phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues of EGFR, including Y845, and subsequent activation of Akt and inactivation of Ras-ERK/MAPK in epidermal keratinocytes [125]. In rat liver epithelial cells, GN4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligand induced not only the Pyk2-p38 MAPK pathway but also the Y845 phosphorylation-induced Grb2-Sos-RAS-ERK pathway, the latter of which can be blocked by the application of either PP2 or the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine, suggesting that Src and ROS are involved in this signaling system [126]. In the cell proliferation and malignancy of MCF7 and SUM149 breast cancer cells, Src-dependent (i.e., dasatinib-sensitive) Y845 phosphorylation (i.e., Y845F mutation-sensitive) signaling was shown to require the activity of p38 MAPK, but not the activity of the EGFR/kinase ERK/MAPK, as well as Akt [127]. ROS that are produced by colchicine and nocodazole, both of which disrupt microtubules, have also been reported to promote Y845 phosphorylation in vascular smooth muscle cells, R22, by which ERK/MAPK signaling is triggered to activate plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression [128]. Functional interaction between uPAR and wild-type EGFR has been shown in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells [129] and in murine embryonic fibroblasts [130], in which Y845F mutation of EGFR or Src inhibition impairs the uPA-induced signaling events, such as STAT5b activation and cell proliferation. The uPAR-Src-EGFR Y845 pathway also contributes to fibronectin matrix assembly and integrin activation in foreskin fibroblast A1-F [131]. The neuronal function of Y845 phosphorylation has been demonstrated by Goldshmit et al. [132], who showed that it plays an important role in neurite outgrowth that is induced by the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2/SOCS2 in central nervous system neurons and in cultured PC12 cells. The cytotoxicity of arsenic trioxide in keratinocytes involves NADPH oxidase/p67phox-mediated production of ROS, which is under the control of Src activation and Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR [133]. ROS-induced Y845 phosphorylation has also been demonstrated in mammary epithelial cells that are treated with benzo[a]pyrene 3,6-quinone and benzo[a]pyrene 1,6-quinone [134]. Survival of hepatocytes in the presence of cadmium also involves a mechanism mediated by NADPH oxidase, the activation of which in turn activates Src, eventually resulting in EGFR Y845 phosphorylation [135].3.3. Involvement of Y845 Phosphorylation in Cell Cycle Control and Cell Viability In some cell systems, Y845 phosphorylation seems to promote growth arrest and/or inhibition of proliferation. In A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, growth arrest induced by high concentrations of EGF is accompanied by Y845 phosphorylation and up-regulation of the STAT3-p21waf1 pathway. In this case, sequestration of the phosphorylated Y845 signal by the introduction into the cells of an antibody that binds to Y845 attenuated these events [49]. A similar anti-proliferative function was also demonstrated in MB-231 breast cancer cells, in which angiocidin and EGF promoted the Y845 phosphorylation and activation of NFκB, which resulted in the induction of p21waf1 and cell cycle arrest [136]. Activation of EGFR signaling sometimes involves action of the extracellular signal that stimulates the shedding of the EGFR ligand. Liu et al. [137] have reported that thrombospondins, and their recombinant proteins containing EGF-like repeats, are capable of inducing EGFR activation (involving the phosphorylation of Y845 and other tyrosine residues) and cell migration in A431 cells through the activation of matrix metalloprotease 9 (but not through direct binding to EGFR). In A431 cells, in which EGFR is overexpressed, depletion of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin causes site-specific phosphorylation of EGFR, including Y845 [138]. Further characterization of this event has revealed that cholesterol most likely affects the phosphorylation state of EGFR by perturbing membrane properties to form membrane microdomains or “lipid rafts”, where Src and other signaling proteins are enriched and constitute a platform for a variety of signal transductions [139–143]. Lipid rafts in vascular smooth muscle cells [144] and bladder carcinoma cells [89,90] have also been reported to work as a scaffold for Src-EGFR signaling. In the case of bladder carcinoma cells, disruption of the membrane microdomains by methyl-β-cyclodextrin results in the interference with Src-dependent signal transduction and the promotion of apoptosis under serum-deprived culture conditions [89,90], although its relationship to the phosphorylation state of EGFR (i.e., Y845) is unknown. The anti-apoptotic mechanism of cell proliferation often involves Y845 phosphorylation. In microvessel endothelial T2 cells, serum-deprivation-induced apoptosis can be prevented by TGFβ1, which promotes such EGFR signaling [145]. Knockdown of EGFR results in the decrease in TGFβ1-induced expression of PAI-1, a major TGFβ1 target that is required for the anti-apoptotic mechanism. TGFβ1-induced expression of PAI-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells, R22, has also been shown to require the Src phosphorylation of Y845 of EGFR [146]. EGFR function, as judged by Y845 and Y1068 phosphorylations, has also been implicated in the anti-apoptosis of PC-3 prostate cancer cells, for which the combined application of β-phenylethyl isothiocyanate and curcumin leads to apoptotic cell death [147]. The activation of EGFR involving Y845 phosphorylation by neurotensin, which is secreted from LNCaP-derived neuroendocrine-like cells, was also shown in PC-3 cells [148]. This supports the idea that malignant prostate cancer cells develop in an environment in which neuroendocrine-differentiated cells secrete mitogenic ligands. Depletion of polyamine sometimes confers resistance to apoptosis, and Y845 phosphorylation is reported to be important in this process [149]. In this case, the kinase activity of EGFR is also required for anti-apoptosis, suggesting the possibility that EGFR and Src synergize in this process. There are some reported examples of the pro-apoptotic function of EGFR Y845 phosphorylation. Reinehr et al. [150] described that, in hydrophobic bile salt-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes, Yes, a Src family PTK, associates with and phosphorylates EGFR on Y845, and contributes to activation of the CD95/Fas/Apo-1-dependent death pathway. In this system, the association of Yes with EGFR can be prevented by the inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase/protein kinase A (PKA), suggesting that the cAMP-PKA pathway acts as anti-apoptotic machinery. Further characterization of this hepatocyte apoptosis system has revealed that death ligand (e.g., CD95 ligand)-induced apoptosis involves the production of ROS, a direct activator of Yes, by a signaling pathway that includes sphingomyelinase, ceramide, PKCζ, and p47phox[151]. In primary hepatocytes, prothrombin induces apoptotic cell death that is accompanied by the prothrombin-dependent degradation of integrin α5. In this system, it has been shown that prothrombin promotes the interaction between integrin α5 and EGFR, which in turn leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of both proteins including Y845 phosphorylation, and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase that is thought to be directly involved in the thrombin-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes [152].3.4. Cell Adhesion Signaling and Y845 Phosphorylation Integrin-mediated cell adhesion is reported to involve the assembly of a macromolecular complex containing integrin αβ dimers, EGFR, p130cas, and Src, in primary skin fibroblasts, ECV304 [153]. In this multimolecular complex, EGFR is phosphorylated in an EGF-independent manner on Y845, Y1068, Y1086, and Y1173, but not on Y1148, a major autophosphorylation site. The involvement of Src in these phosphorylations is not known; however, Src seems to be required for the recruitment of EGFR to the cell surface in response to integrin activation [153]. On the other hand, Wang et al. [154] have shown that, in squamous carcinoma cells, SCC12, the depletion of ganglioside GM3, which has been reported to be inhibitory to the integrin-dependent activation of EGFR, induces the phosphorylation of EGFR on Y845, Y1068, and Y1148, but not on Y1086 and Y1173. In this case, Src dependence is only evident in Y845 phosphorylation, whereas Y1068 and Y1148 phosphorylations seem to require EGFR and PI3K activities, respectively [154]. In NMuMG cells that are derived from epithelial cells of mouse mammary gland, fibronectin-induced cell adhesion promotes ligand-independent activation of EGFR involving Y845 phosphorylation and the recruitment of p120RasGAP and p190RhoGAP, thereby leading to the inhibition of stress fiber formation as well as the stimulation of filopodium formation and priming to EMT [155,156]. In this system, the dominant-negative function of mutant EGFR, in which a dileucine motif (679-LL) in the juxtamembrane domain of EGFR is mutated to two alanine residues (679-AA) because of its failure to undergo fibronectin-induced Y845 phosphorylation, has been characterized. In colon carcinoma cells (HT29 and SW480) and breast cancer cells (MCF-7), homophilic ligation of E-cadherin and its interaction with β-catenin are reported to be inhibitory to cell growth by reducing the frequency of cells entering S phase [157]. In this system, inhibition of EGFR signaling involving Y845 phosphorylation, but not EGFR autophosphorylation, and STAT5-dependent signal transduction, but not ERK/MAPK activation, are critical. Intracellular interaction between Cas and Src is also reported to be responsible for the activation of EGFR signaling involving Y845 phosphorylation and STAT5b translocation to the nucleus that contribute to the tamoxifen-resistant proliferation and survival of MCF7 cells [158]. Epithelial cell adhesion, migration, and wound healing in hydrogen peroxide-treated rabbit cornea also involve the Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR [159].3.5. Sperm Functions and Y845 Phosphorylation Some recent reports have shown that the Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR may be important for the biological functions associated with male gamete cells, sperm. The treatment of bovine sperm with EGF or ouabain, a specific inhibitor of Na+/K+-ATPase, has been shown to promote the acrosomal exocytosis of sperm cells, an event that needs to occur before the contact between sperm and egg at fertilization [160]. Ouabain is known to stimulate intracellular signal transduction through the binding to membrane-associated Na+/K+-ATPase, trans-activations of the EGFR (suggesting the involvement of Src), and the release of ROS from mitochondria. In fact, the ouabain-induced acrosomal exocytosis involves PKA/Src-dependent Y845 phosphorylation in EGFR [160]. Y845 phosphorylation has also been shown to occur in ram sperm in response to EGF-induced capacitation [161]. As opposed to the case mentioned above, PKA activity can also act as an inhibitory signal for the Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR. In primary rat hepatocytes cultured on collagen-containing gels, EGF-induced Src-dependent Y845 phosphorylation and cell proliferation are augmented by the addition of H-89, a specific PKA inhibitor [162].3.6. Other Cellular Functions and Y845 Phosphorylation In pancreatic β-cells, Y845 and Y1068 phosphorylations of EGFR are involved in EGFR activation in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone, by which pancreatic β-cells undergo successful development and maturation [163]. In the renal cortical collecting duct cell line, M1-kidney CCD, the mineralocorticoid aldosterone acts as a critical hormone in the regulation of sodium, potassium, and proton fluxes. Under these conditions, Src-dependent Y845 phosphorylation acts as a signal of the crosstalk between aldosterone receptor and EGFR, which culminates in the activation of protein kinase D1, a kinase responsible for gene expression in response to aldosterone [164]. A study of the intracellular signaling response to environmental pollutants has revealed the involvement of Y845 phosphorylation. Zinc ions (Zn2+) have been shown to promote Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR, by which Zn2+-induced Ras activation is triggered in B82L fibroblast cells [165]. This effect of Zn2+ involves neither dimerization nor autophosphorylation of EGFR, and can be canceled by the Src-specific inhibitor PP2, but not by the EGFR inhibitor PD153035; however, PD153035 has been shown to interfere with ERK/MAPK activation [166]. Another kind of environmental pollutant, hexachlorobenzene, has also been shown to promote Src activation and Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR, which leads to the activation of STAT5b and the ERK/MAPK pathways and cell migration [167,168]. Iron-containing air pollution particles have been shown to activate NF-κB, a major trigger of an acute inflammatory response that would act on the pulmonary epithelial cell surface, via a pathway involving Src and EGFR [169]. Other cellular functions involving Y845 phosphorylation include wound-induced activation of the Src/EGFR pathway in corneal epithelial cells [170], intestinal cell proliferation and tumorigenesis that can be inactivated by the interaction of farnesoid X receptor with Src, leading to the inactivation of Src and the decrease in Y845 phosphorylation [171], and colon cancer proliferation that is stimulated by Src-mediated aryl hydrocarbon receptor and EGFR interactions, leading to Y845 phosphorylation and ERK/MAPK activation [172]. In primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells, sialyl Lewis X modification of EGFR involving Y845 phosphorylation contributes to wound-induced epithelial repair [173]. Another line of evidence shows that reduction of the expression of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-μ results in an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, including that on Y845, in response to airway epithelial injury [174]. Analysis of keratinocytes as a model system for analyzing cutaneous tissue repair also demonstrates the involvement of EGFR phosphorylation including Y845 [175]. In this case, EGFR is trans-activated by the kinin B(1) receptor system; however, the involvement of Src in this event is not known. Src-dependent Y845 phosphorylation also contributes to ERK/MAPK activation and proliferation of normal keratinocytes, which involves amphiregulin-mediated autocrine signaling of EGFR [176]. An alkylating agent, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, has been shown to compete with EGF in the binding to EGFR, thus inhibiting the signaling pathway regulated by EGFR phosphorylation, including the basal level of Y845 phosphorylation [177]. The sensitization of EGF-induced signaling (e.g., intracellular Ca2+ release) in primary cultures of rat adrenal chromaffin cells and PC12 cells by bradykinin-dependent G-protein-coupled signal transduction involves Src activation and the Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR [178]. This study also demonstrated that cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains serve as a platform for the Src-EGFR functional interaction, and that Y845F mutation results in a failure of signal transduction. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of nuclear translocation/localization of EGFR in cetuximab-resistant NSCLC cells (NCI-H226), Iida et al. [179] have shown that Y1101, but not Y845, in EGFR is a critical tyrosine residue that is phosphorylated by Yes and Lyn.4. Molecular Insights into Y845 Phosphorylation and Its Applications In an initial report on Y845 phosphorylation of EGFR by Src, it was noted that the phosphorylation requires not only the catalytic activity of Src but also the binding of EGF to EGFR [40]. This suggests that EGF-induced dimerization and/or other conformational changes of EGFR are required for Y845 phosphorylation. As mentioned above, Y845 is present in the activation segment of the protein kinase domain, a region that is located in-between the protein kinase subdomains VII and VIII. Protein-serine/threonine kinases as well as tyrosine kinases contain one or two phosphorylation sites in their own activation segment, most of which are autophosphorylation sites (e.g., PKA, Src) and/or kinase-activating phosphorylation sites (in some cases, they are phosphorylated by other kinases, e.g., EGFR, ERK/MAPK) [33,34]. Structural analyses of some protein kinases (e.g., cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1/CDK1, ERK/MAPK, PKA, Src) have demonstrated that phosphorylation in the activation segment leads to a conformational change in the catalytic cleft of the kinase domain, which allows the kinase domain to interact effectively with substrate proteins [180–186]. In the case of EGFR, the following scheme can be hypothesized: (1) binding of EGF to the extracellular domain of EGFR promotes a conformational change in its kinase domain (opening of the activation segment); (2) Y845 in the activation segment becomes exposed to the outer surface of the EGFR kinase domain (display of Y845); (3) exposed Y845 becomes accessible to Src, thereby being phosphorylated; and (4) the phosphorylated Y845 and its surrounding amino acid sequence provide a docking site for the Src homology 2 domain of Src and phosphotyrosine-binding domains of other signaling molecules (e.g., STAT3, CoxII), leading to the physical interaction of EGFR and these molecules. Mutational studies on EGFR have shed light on the molecular insights into Y845 phosphorylation. Choi et al. [187] and Yang et al. [188] have shown that, in L834R and/or L837Q mutants of EGFR, which are pathologically found in NSCLC and 32D cells, Y845 phosphorylation takes place in an erlotinib-sensitive, but EGF- and Src-independent manner. Under these conditions, the activation of STAT5 and the expression of c-Myc are also stimulated, suggesting that the Y845 phosphorylation acts as in the case of its Src-dependent phosphorylation. Shan et al. [189] have studied further the structural impact of the L834R mutation of EGFR; it may counteract the disordered structure of the inactive EGFR kinase domain and facilitate the dimerization, so that the active kinase domain is stabilized. In addition, it has been suggested that Y845 phosphorylation, by acting as a more physiological trigger of the conformational change seen in the L834R mutant, is part of the self-sustained EGFR activation and amplification. A similar mechanism of stabilization of the active site by the amino acids near Y845 has also been reported by Timms et al. [190], who showed that E844 and H846 may participate in H-bonding interactions, thus stabilizing the active site region of the EGFR kinase domain. Another line of evidence using a synthetic peptide (EGFR-13), which corresponds to residues 645–657 of EGFR, has indicated that the EGFR-13 region interacts markedly with some other regions of the EGFR kinase domain, so that kinase activity of EGFR involving Y845 phosphorylation is stimulated [191]. These results suggest that EGFR has the potential to autophosphorylate on Y845 in an EGFR conformation-dependent manner. This idea is also supported by the study of Qiu et al. [192], who showed that a mutant EGFR, in which a stop codon had been introduced following the position encoding G998, could autophosphorylate Y845 in a PP2-insensitive and erlotinib-sensitive manner. There are some reports showing that the phosphorylated Y845 sequence may be useful as a resource for artificial substances that could manipulate cellular functions. Buerger et al. [193] have reported the screening and identification of a short peptide aptamer that interacts with the kinase domain of EGFR and interferes with certain steps of EGFR signaling, including Y845 phosphorylation, Shc and STAT3 activations, and the growth of Herc cells (NIH3T3 overexpressing EGFR), SKBR breast cancer cells, and A431 cells, but not ERK/MAPK activation. The short aptamer peptide, termed KDI1, has an amino acid sequence of VFGVSWVVGFWCQMHRRLVC and its amino and carboxyl termini are coupled with bacterial thioredoxin protein that serves as a scaffold protein for the peptide. Kim and Huang [194] have reported that a synthetic peptide mimicking the EGFR Y845 site (EEEEpYFELV) can be successfully delivered into lung cancer cells, H460, and to the tumor in a xenograft mouse model, by which biochemical (e.g., STAT5 phosphorylation) as well as cell biological functions (e.g., tumor growth) of cancer are effectively blocked. We have also shown that an antibody, which recognizes a phosphoY845 region of EGFR, can be introduced into A431 cells, and that it acts as an inhibitor of EGF-dependent signal transduction, such as STAT3 activation and p21waf1 induction [49]. Thus, these materials designed for the Y845-containing region of EGFR are useful tools to investigate the cellular functions regulated by Y845, with a potential for further development as therapeutic reagents for cancer and other diseases.5. Conclusions For the past eighteen years or so, since the initial discovery of the Src phosphorylation of EGFR on Y845, much progress has been made in the recognition that Y845 phosphorylation takes place in a variety of cancerous and normal physiological cell contexts, as well as in the understanding that Y845 phosphorylation plays pivotal roles in these cellular contexts (Figure 2). Because EGFR and Src are expressed in almost all normal cells and tissues, the possible impact of their molecular interactions that lead to Y845 phosphorylation may not be limited to the known phenomena described in this review article, but rather spread more to other cellular functions that have not yet been documented. EGFR and Src are prototypical gene products, whose viral counterparts are oncogenic, and molecular and enzymatic functions are the transmembrane receptor PTK and the cytoplasmic non-receptor PTK, respectively. The co-overexpression of these proteins sometimes confers high malignancy for certain kinds of human cancer, and their continued study should provide more information of fundamental importance in the field of basic cell biology, as well as in cancer and other pathological areas of cell biology and medicine.

Introduction The oxidation of quinol by the cytochrome (cyt) bc1 complex is a key step of cellular energy conversion in respiration and photosynthesis. The mitochondrial cyt bc1 complex couples electron transfer from ubiquinol to cyt c with the translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane and contributes to the proton motive force that drives ATP synthesis (Saraste 1999; Hunte et al. 2008). The cyt bc1 complex has three cofactor-containing catalytic subunits, cyt b, cyt c1, and the Rieske iron–sulfur protein (Rieske ISP), and it has two active sites, which are integrated in the membrane-embedded cyt b. The quinol oxidation site (Qo site) and the quinone reduction site (Qi site) are located on opposite sides of the membrane close to intermembrane space and matrix, respectively. Reversible docking of the Rieske ISP to a small opening of the Qo site closes the site and brings it to its active conformation (fig. 1). The oxidation of the lipophilic two-electron two-proton carrier ubiquinol is the central step of the enzyme mechanism, the so-called Q cycle (Mitchell 1976). Two protons are released from ubiquinol to the intermembrane space, and the two electrons are transferred in a bifurcated manner in one direction through the iron–sulfur cluster of the Rieske ISP to cyt c and in the other direction through heme bL and heme bH to the Qi site, at which ubiquinone is reduced to semiquinone and after a second reaction cycle to ubiquinol with concomitant uptake of two protons from the matrix side. His181 of the Rieske ISP and Glu272 of cyt b were identified as potential primary proton acceptors at the Qo site (Crofts et al. 1999; Hunte et al. 2000; Palsdottir et al. 2003). Glu272 and the adjacent amino acid residues Pro271, Trp273, and Tyr274 were early recognized as catalytically important and denominated as conserved PEWY motif of mitochondrial cyt b (Hauska et al. 1988; Trumpower 1990; Gennis et al. 1993). Whereas the spatial arrangement of iron–sulfur cluster and heme bL that enables bifurcated electron transfer is well described by X-ray structures of mitochondrial and bacterial complexes (Xia et al. 1997; Zhang et al. 1998; Hunte et al. 2000; Kurisu et al. 2003; Stroebel et al. 2003; Esser et al. 2006; Kleinschroth et al. 2011), the proton acceptors at the Qo site and the proton transfer mechanism are debated (Hunte et al. 2000; Palsdottir et al. 2003; Seddiki et al. 2008; Crofts et al. 2013; Postila et al. 2013). As the Q cycle substantially contributes to the generation of proton motive force, malfunction of cyt bc1 complex results in lowered energy levels (Wallace 2005), increase of deleterious reactive oxygen species (Wallace 2012), and failure in redox control of mitochondria (Vafai and Mootha 2012). Mutations in the mitochondrial cyt b gene are also associated with neurodegeneration (Koopman et al. 2013), cardiomyopathy (Andreu et al. 2000), and cancer (Wallace 2012). Fig. 1.— Model of ubiquinol oxidation in the Qo site of mitochondrial cyt bc1 complex. The catalytic site is embedded in cyt b (white surface) and closed by the Rieske ISP (brown surface). The Rieske iron–sulfur cluster (Rieske ISC) and the low potential b heme (heme bL) are electron acceptors for quinol oxidation, and His181 from the Rieske ISP and Glu272 from cyt b are postulated proton acceptors. Ubiqinone-6 (UQ) was docked in the X-ray structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cyt bc1 complex (pdb 3cx5) by RosettaLigand (Combs et al. 2013). The isoprenyl chain of ubiquinone was partially truncated for clarity. The Qo motif of S. cerevisiae cyt b, Pro271, Glu272, Trp273, and Tyr274 (PEWY) is depicted with side chains. The latter are also shown for His253 of cyt b and for His181 of Rieske ISP. Many bacteria also employ cyt bc1 complexes in metabolic pathways that require electron transfer between quinone and cyt c, for instance, in oxidative phosphorylation, anaerobic photosynthesis (Gennis et al. 1993), or nitrate reduction (Richardson et al. 2001). Furthermore, homologous sequences of cyt b can be found in many enzyme complexes with quinol oxidase activity, such as the cytochrome b6f (cyt b6f) complexes from Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts (Kurisu et al. 2003; Stroebel et al. 2003) or the Sulfolobales quinone oxidase (Sox) complex from thermoacidophilic Archaea (Schäfer et al. 2001). The natural quinone species of prokaryotes is phylogenetically dependent (Collins and Jones 1981), and the respective substrates of prokaryotic cyt bc1 and b6f complexes are therefore diverse. Nevertheless, the quinone substrates can be classified into two groups as high potential (ubiquinone, plastoquinone, and caldariella quinone) and low potential (menaquinone, phyloquinone, and thermoplasma quinone) (Nowicka and Kruk 2010). Accordingly, the redox potential of the cofactors of the respective cyt bc1 and b6f complexes also correlates with that of the substrates (Schoepp-Cothenet et al. 2009). The catalytic core of cyt bc1 and cyt b6f complexes from eukaryotic and prokaryotic origin is structurally very similar. Mitochondrial cyt b consists of eight transmembrane helices (helices A–H, fig. 2), which can be grouped in N- and C-terminal region (Xia et al. 1997). The N-terminal region covers a four helix bundle (helices A–D), which hosts the four canonical histidine ligands heme bH and heme bL. The C-terminal region comprises helices E–H including Glu272 of the PEWY motif, which is part of the ef loop between helices E and F (fig. 1). Notably, in cyt b6f complexes, the N- and C-terminal regions of cyt b exist as two separately encoded polypeptides (fig. 2). The protein equivalent to the N-terminal region is called cyt b6, whereas the protein equivalent to the C-terminal region is called subunit four (SUIV) (Stroebel et al. 2003). These two subunits of the cyt b6f complex were hypothesized to share a common ancestor with cyt b due to the high degree of sequence similarity (Widger et al. 1984; Hauska et al. 1988). In addition, cyt b with separate N- and C-terminal proteins, referred to as “split form” hereafter, is also present in haloarchaea and Firmicutes (Gonzalez et al. 2009; Baymann and Nitschke 2010). Glu272 of cyt b is the likely ligand of ubiquinol in cyt bc1 and in cyt b6f complexes as its interaction with substrate analogs was documented in X-ray structures of these complexes (Xia et al. 1997; Zhang et al. 1998; Hunte et al. 2000; Kurisu et al. 2003; Stroebel et al. 2003; Esser et al. 2006; Kleinschroth et al. 2011). However, direct experimental evidence for ubiquinol binding is still lacking, and the key role of this residue in quinol oxidation was debated as enzyme activity shows resilience to mutations of this residue (Hunte et al. 2008). Substitution of Glu272 by site-directed mutagenesis to aspartate, glutamine, or valine lowered quinol cyt c reductase (QCR) activity of the cyt bc1 complex substantially but did not completely abolish it (Zito et al. 1998; Osyczka et al. 2006; Wenz et al. 2006; Seddiki et al. 2008). Interestingly, mutations of Glu272 of the yeast enzyme elevate the production of reactive oxygen species as a result of unproductive bypass reactions (Wenz et al. 2006, 2007). In addition, Glu272 is not fully conserved in cyt b as previously pointed out, but Val272 appears to be characteristic for β- and γ-Proteobacteria (Wenz et al. 2006). In the latter study, the hypothesis was put forward that in organisms which lack a protonable amino acid residue in position 272, a conserved glutamate at position 253 takes over the role of Glu272. This is supported by the fact that both residues are structurally very close, namely in hydrogen bonding distance in mitochondrial cyt bc1 (fig. 1). Fig. 2.— Structural composition of cyt b. The subunit can be divided in N- and C-terminal regions. Cyt b is encoded as single protein in mitochondria and most bacteria (left, pdb 2ibz). In cyt b6f complexes, these two regions are encoded as two separate polypeptides (right, pdb 1q90) and are denoted cyt b6 and SUIV. Transmembrane and relevant surface helices are labeled with upper and lower case letters, respectively. The Qi site of cyt bc1 complexes is occupied by the natural substrate ubiquinone-6. The Qo site of both cyt bc1 and cyt b6f complexes are, respectively, indicated by their inhibitors, stigmatellin and tridecylstigmatellin, in hydrogen bonding distance to the Glu272 equivalent residue of the Qo motif. The structural composition of cyt b is shown schematically in the lower panel. The four “H” denote the four strictly conserved histidine axial ligands of heme bH and heme bL, and the Qo motif is labeled on the C-terminal region and SUIV. Cyt b6f complexes possess a heme ci at the Qi site, which is absent in cyt bc1 complexes. Cyt b is universal in mitochondrial genomes and its high degree of conservation led to its use as molecular phylogenetic marker (Meyer 1994). As evolutionary, biochemical, and structural studies of cyt bc1 complexes are largely focused on complexes of mitochondrial, proteobacterial, and photosynthetic origin, the aforementioned PEWY residues are so far considered as highly conserved and as characteristic motif for ubiquinol oxidation, thus denoted PEWY motif of ubiquinol oxidation (Lebrun et al. 2006; Osyczka et al. 2006). Although variations in the PEWY motif were detected for individual organisms (Brasseur et al. 2002; Wenz et al. 2006), this motif has never been challenged systematically using the information of the latest genomic sequences available in public databases, which grew over 10-fold in the past 10 years (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/, last accessed July 18, 2014), nor discussed in phylogenetic context (Baymann et al. 2012; Dibrova et al. 2013; ten Brink et al. 2013). Here, a comprehensive evolutionary study of cyt b sequences addresses the molecular evolution of the quinol oxidation motif. Domain-based homology search and homologous sequence clustering enabled analysis of split cyt b sequences and processing of large genomic data. A substantial natural variance of the PEWY residues was revealed and phylum-specific patterns were identified. A clear correlation between the pattern of the motif, which is now denoted Qo motif, the redox-potential of cyt bc1 complexes, and of quinol species was observed leading to the hypothesis that the Qo motif evolved from PDWY in menaquinol utilizing low potential complexes to PEWY in ubiquinol oxidizing high potential complexes in adaptation to the emerging oxygen atmosphere.Materials and MethodsDomain-Composition-Based Homology Search The definition of N- and C-terminal regions of cyt b was obtained from the protein domain database PROSITE (entry names: PS51002 and PS51003) (Sigrist et al. 2010). The respective profile hidden Markov models of both cyt b regions were built on the true-positive multiple sequence alignments of PS51002 and PS51003 by HMMER3 (Eddy 2011), as HMM_COBn and HMM_COBc. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence (RefSeq) protein database release 59 (May 2013, Pruitt et al. 2007) was queried with HMM_COBn and with HMM_COBc by HMMER3, and all the protein sequences above the default inclusion threshold (e value < 1e-3) were collected into two pools of accession numbers, COB_n and COB_c, with 7,301 and 6,490 entries, respectively. Accession numbers that are present in both COB_n and COB_c represent protein sequences, which carry both N- and C-terminal regions of cyt b. They were selected and aligned by Clustal Omega (Sievers et al. 2011). After removing entries that lack any of the four axial histidine ligands of heme bH and heme bL (His82, His96, His183, and His197), and entries with gaps (incomplete sequences) or with nonidentified amino acids (X) at the Qo motif (amino acids 271–274), 5,524 cyt b sequences with both N- and C-terminal regions were obtained and are named as the group COB_NC (fig. 3). Unless denoted, all amino acids throughout the text are numbered according to the sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Fig. 3.— Domain search strategy and homology clustering. Homologous sequences of the N- and C-terminal region of cyt b (COB_n) and (COB_c) were detected by HMMER3 (Eddy 2011) from the NCBI RefSeq database (Pruitt et al. 2007). Colors of the N- and C-terminal regions are identical to figure 2, and the striped box denotes the C-terminal region below the inclusion threshold of HMMER3, whereas its Qo motif was identified by multiple sequence alignment (COB_NC’). Entries from COB_n and COB_c were sorted according to their structural compositions as COB_NC, COB_NC’, COB_N, and COB_C (see Materials and Methods), with incomplete sequences removed. The latter two groups represent cyt b with split N- and C-terminal regions and were further paired according to their gene locus tags to represent their full-length form (COB_N//C). Representative sequences were obtained by clustering all sequences with 50–100% identity by CD-HIT (Li and Godzik 2006). Protein sequences that do not simultaneously possess N- and C-terminal regions are either separate N- and C-terminal polypeptides (COB_N and COB_C) or cyt b with a conserved N-terminal region but with the C-terminal region below the inclusion threshold of HMMER3 (COB_NC’). Although the C-terminal region of group COB_NC’ could not be detected by HMMER3, the Qo motif correctly aligned with the yeast sequence. After removing incomplete sequences as for COB_NC, 865, 859 and 743 entries were obtained in COB_N, COB_C and COB_NC’, respectively. Six cyt b homologous to the archaeal genus Pyrobaculum were found to consistently lack the fourth histidine ligand of the b hemes. To examine their phylogenetic positions, all six Pyrobaculum cyt b were merged to COB_NC’, resulting in 749 entries (fig. 3). Because functional cyt b must contain both its N- and C-terminal regions, the full-length form of the cyt b encoded as two separate polypeptides was reconstituted based on gene locus (locus_tag) and the genome source (“taxon,” the NCBI Taxonomy identifier) parsed from the GenePept Full Format of NCBI RefSeq database. Split N- and C-terminal protein sequences of cyt b with the same “taxon” and consecutive locus_tags represent the gene translation products from the same cluster. By this approach, 820 N- and C-terminal proteins of cyt b were paired (COB_N//C, fig. 3). Many organisms possess more than one N- or C-terminal region, which resulted in unpaired 45 N- and 39 C-terminal sequences of cyt b, and which were not used in phylogenetic analysis. To summarize, 5,524 cyt b with both N- and C-terminal regions (COB_NC), 749 cyt b with strong N-terminal but weak similarity at C-terminal region (COB_NC’), and 820 pairs of split form of cyt b (COB_N//C) were obtained from NCBI RefSeq database. Multiple sequence alignments were analyzed with the Jalview application (Waterhouse et al. 2009).Data Reduction, Phylogenetic Analysis, and Structural Modeling As the number of cyt b sequences obtained by domain-based homology search is large and includes many close homologs, the phylogenetic tree of cyt b was constructed on a set of selected sequences, of which each entry represents a cluster of sequences with 50–100% of the identity. The CD-HIT application (Li and Godzik 2006) was employed to choose the representative cyt b sequences from COB_NC, COB_NC’, and the C-terminal sequences of COB_N//C, respectively, and 94, 46, and 27 sequences were obtained from each group. The 27 selected cyt b C-terminal proteins were concatenated with their N-terminal counterpart to constitute the artificial full-length form, and all 167 sequences were merged for multiple sequence alignment. ZP_07204297 and YP_003734430 were removed as the third conserved histidine ligand of b hemes failed to align. XP_004728903 was replaced by the concatenated NP_958365 and NP_958359 due to a long (606 aa) N-terminal fusion of XP_004228903 to photosystem II CP47 chlorophyll apoprotein-like protein. The yeast cyt b (NP_009315) was added to the final set of representatives (COB_50, 166 sequences, fig. 3) for allocating equivalent residues. The Bayesian inference tree of the COB_50 was calculated by MrBayes (Ronquist et al. 2012), with eight chains, 3,500,000 generations, burnin set to 25% of the sample, and temperature set to 0.1. The Bayesian tree of Rieske ISP was calculated with identical parameters but with 500,000 generations. Phylogenetic trees were plotted by FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/, last accessed July 21, 2014). The standalone NCBI BLAST+ application (version 2.28) was used for managing the local copy of RefSeq database and performing homology search (Altschul et al. 1997). The natural substrate of cyt bc1 complex, ubiquinone-6 was docked into the Qo site by RosettaLigand (Combs et al. 2013), with the coordinates of ubiquinone-6 obtained from pdb 2ibz, and the coordinate of Rieske ISP and cyt b from pdb 3cx5. Open Source PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org, last accessed July 21, 2014) was used for analyzing X-ray structures of proteins and generating illustrations.ResultsSystematic Sampling of cyt b Sequences by Structural Composition Analysis and Sequence Clustering For the comprehensive retrieval of all protein sequences homologous to cyt b, the structural composition of cyt b with its N-terminal cofactor-bearing helical bundle and the C-terminal region that encompasses the Qo site as well as the split form of cyt b must be taken into account. Homologous sequences were identified in the curated, nonredundant NCBI RefSeq database (Pruitt et al. 2007) with the program HMMER3 (Eddy 2011) using two profile hidden Markov models for N- and C-terminal region, respectively. This resulted in two groups of proteins, COB_n and COB_c, which were subsequently sorted into four groups according to their structural composition (fig. 3). Group COB_NC comprises cyt b sequences with both N- and C-terminal regions and is with 5,524 entries the largest group. Group COB_N encompasses those proteins with the N-terminal region only and group COB_C the ones which only have the C-terminal region. Group COB_NC’ comprises cyt b sequences for which an N-terminal region but not a C-terminal region was detected by HMMER, yet the Qo motif could still be identified by multiple sequence alignment. As functional cyt bc1 or b6f complexes must contain both N- and C-terminal regions, COB_N and COB_C from the same organism were further paired according to their gene loci, forming the COB_N//C group (fig. 3, details see Material and Methods). The quality of the sequences obtained was examined by an initial multiple sequence alignment within each group. The four axial histidine ligands of heme bH and heme bL (His82, His96, His183, and His197) are considered as invariable, because the loss of either heme bH or heme bL would abolish the electron transfer across the membrane leading to an incomplete Q cycle. Sequence fragments that do not cover these four histidine ligands and those which carry other residues than histidine at these positions were removed. The resulting alignment showed complete conservation at these positions. As His82 and His96 locate on transmembrane helix B, and His183 and His197 are positioned at transmembrane helix D, this principle ensured that the multiple sequence alignment of the N-terminal region of cyt b fits to its actual spatial arrangement, and therefore, the alignment did not need any further optimization. Six cyt b sequences homologous to Pyrobaculum aerophilum, which do not possess the fourth His ligand of the b hemes (supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online), were intentionally included in our analysis for examining its phylogenetic position. The same sequence alignment approach was applied to the C-terminal region of cyt b. As the variability of the quinol oxidation motif is the subject of analysis, sequence fragments which do not cover or could not be aligned without gaps for this motif were removed. Because 7,093 homologous sequences of cyt b were identified from the NCBI RefSeq database with the aforementioned approach, the CD-HIT sequence clustering algorithm (Li and Godzik 2006) was employed to reduce the size of this sequence pool by selecting representatives. Sequences that share identities higher than 50% were grouped in one cluster, and the longest one was selected as the cluster representative. The resulting group of sequences was named COB_50 (166 sequences, fig. 3). The multiple sequence alignment of COB_50 shows 100% identities for the heme ligands His82, His96, His183, and His197 with a single exception of His197 due to the presence of P. aerophilum cyt b. The PEWY sequence (Pro271, Glu272, Trp273, and Tyr274) of the C-terminal region is so far considered as characteristic motif for quinol oxidation (Trumpower 1990; Gennis et al. 1993; Crofts et al. 2013). Interestingly, the analysis of the frequency of amino acids at these four positions shows a substantial natural variance (table 1). The highest diversity is at the second position, in which glutamate, aspartate, and proline are present at the frequency of 50%, 23%, and 19%, respectively. The other residues show less variation, with proline at the first, tryptophane at the third and tyrosine at the fourth position with frequencies of 84%, 96%, and 84%, respectively. Notably, Trp273 has the highest degree of conservation. It might be structurally important to position the N-terminus of the ef-helix (fig. 1). Six major patterns were identified, namely PEWY, PDWY, APWY, PDWF, PPWF, and GPWF. With these variations in mind, the sequence of the four characteristic Qo site residues that have functional importance for quinol oxidation is henceforth called Qo motif. The evolutionary analysis below shows that the described variations are lineage specific (fig. 4), and the biochemical implications of the distinct patterns of the Qo motif are discussed in phylogenetic context. Fig. 4.— The unrooted Bayesian phylogenetic tree of 166 cyt b representatives (COB_50), obtained by sequence clustering from 7,093 homologs based on maximum 50% shared identities. All branches were transformed to equal length for demonstration. Detailed information on tip labels, branching probabilities, and original branching lengths is provided in supplementary figure S1, Supplementary Material online. Major clades are illustrated in the same color. The first line of the clade annotation is the dominant taxon, and the second line refers to the major Qo motifs. Five clades of cyt b marked with “mixed taxa” do not have a major phylogenetic group but show distinct Qo motifs. Cyt b fused with class I cyt c and ISP are labeled with -cyt c and -FeS, respectively. The accession numbers of all sequences analyzed, and Qo motifs and clade-specific informations are listed in supplementary tables S3–S10, Supplementary Material online.

Noteworthily, the patterns of the Qo motif are consistently distributed in major clades of the cyt b tree. Most clades are systematically composed of organisms, which are close on the 16s rRNA tree (Yarza et al. 2008). The major branches are named according to their predominant phylogenetic groups. Cyt b from α, β, γ, and ε-Proteobacteria as well as from Aquificae, mitochondria, and the genus Geobacter from δ-Proteobacteria form the proteobacterial clades. More than 99% of cyt b from α-Proteobacteria and mitochondria, and all cyt b from ε-Proteobacteria and Aquificae carry PEWY as Qo motif, whereas cyt b from β- and γ-Proteobacteria mainly comprise PVWY (fig. 4, supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). PEWY as the conventional Qo motif is only dominating in mitochondrial and α-, δ-, ε-proteobacterial cyt b as well as in cyt b6f complexes from cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. PDWY is the major pattern of the Qo motif in Firmicutes, haloarchaea, Actinobacteria, Deinococcus–Thermus, and in most of the Archaea (fig. 4). Notably, four clades are formed by cyt b with distinct Qo motif yet from phylogenetically distant organisms. The APWY clade was named after the conserved Qo motif APWY. The PEWY-cyt c and PDWY-cyt c clades denote the general feature that a class I cyt c domain is fused to the C-terminal end of cyt b and PEWY and PDWY as respective Qo motif. Cyt b with the GPWY motif are clustered in an independent branch, and a few bacteria possess cyt b with PDWF as Qo motif and a non-Rieske type ISP fused (PDWF-FeS). Most of the archaeal cyt b homologous sequences, with the exception of the haloarchaeal ones, form a single clade (Thaumarchaeota, Thermoplasma, and Thermoprotei), whereas cyt b from haloarchaea is clustered with cyt b of Deinococcus–Thermus and Actinobacteria. Notably, cyt b from the green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobi), the photosynthetic acidobacteria Candidatus Chloracidobacterium thermophilum (Bryant et al. 2007), and the anaerobic methane oxidizer Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera, which belongs to the candidate division NC10 (Ettwig et al. 2010), are clustered in the same branch with PEWY as the common Qo motif. In addition to the phylogenetic analysis, a detailed evaluation of lineage-specific frequency of the especially variable second residue of the Qo motif was carried out for all 7,093 cyt b homologous sequences (supplementary tables S1 and S2, Supplementary Material online). Furthermore, the natural variance of the residue His253 was analyzed as it is postulated to conduct proton transfer when the residue at the 272nd position is neither glutamate nor aspartate (Wenz et al. 2006). The assignment of His253 equivalent residues was unambiguously determined for all sequences from cyt b from α-, β-, γ-, ε-Proteobacteria, Aquificae, and mitochondria based on the invariable amino acids up- and downstream of this position (for instance, see supplementary fig. S4, Supplementary Material online). As cyt b6f and cyt bc1 complexes coexist in photosynthetic eukaryotes, supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online, exclusively includes organisms that possess cyt b6f complexes, and supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online, contains cyt b from all other organisms. Lineage-specific Qo motifs were identified by these phylogenetic and frequency analyses and are described in detail below.The Qo Motif Is PEWY in Mitochondria, Proteobacteria, and Photosynthetic Organisms Among all sequences analyzed, in mitochondria, α- and ε-Proteobacteria, and in cyt b6f complexes from photosynthetic organisms, the Qo motif is identified as PEWY. Cyt b from Viridiplantae, Stramenopiles, and Alveolata form the deepest, and fungal cyt b form the second deepest branches among the mitochondrial clades. All other mitochondrial branches are from Metazoa (fig. 4). Histidine at position 253, the residue potentially involved in proton translocation (Palsdottir et al. 2003), also dominates in α-Proteobacteria and in fungi (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). All ε-Proteobacteria carry PEWY as Qo motif and Asp253. Cyt b from δ-Proteobacteria systematically possess glutamate or proline at the second position of their Qo motif. PVWY as Qo motif was exclusively found in β-proteobacterial and γ-proteobacterial homologs. In these sequences, glutamate is present at the 253rd position. A few γ-proteobacterial sequences (26 out of 629, supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online, column “Glu-all”) carry leucine, threonine, isoleucine, methionine, or proline at the 272nd equivalent position, yet glutamate is identified at the 253rd position. Therefore, among β- and γ-Proteobacteria, it is a specific trait that Glu253 is conserved, and a hydrophobic residue is located at the 272nd position in cyt b. A Glu253 and PVWY combination, which is typically seen in β- and γ-Proteobacteria, was also identified in two metazoa sequences, namely Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis (XP 002944063) and Amphimedon queenslandica (XP_003389655). These two sequences have 90% amino acid sequence identity when compared with β-proteobacterial cyt b (YP_006853258, Acidovorax sp. KKS102) and 88% when compared with γ-proteobacterial cyt b (YP_006295122, Methylophaga sp. JAM1). Notably, both eukaryotic sequences are present in nuclear genomes, whereas their mitochondria encode a typical mitochondrial cyt b (YP_203382 and YP_001031207, respectively). These cases would indicate interdomain horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and metazoa (Dunning Hotopp et al. 2007) if they are not the result of errors in genomic sequencing or due to the contamination by genomes from symbionts.PDWY as the Predominant Qo Motif in Gram-Positive Bacteria and Deinococcus–Thermus Aspartate at the second position of the Qo motif is mostly identified in Gram-positive bacteria, Archaea, and bacteria, which do not belong to the phylum Proteobacteria. Among the 304 cyt b homologous proteins identified in Firmicutes, 297 sequences carry aspartate (PDWY) and 2 carry glutamate (PEWY) at the 272nd equivalent position (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). Notably, the only Firmicutes that carry PEWY are the anaerobic, nonoxygenic photosynthetic heliobacteria (fig. 5a). Except Desulfosporosinus which locates at the lowest branch of the PEWY-cyt c/PDWY-cyt c clades, all cyt b homologs from Firmicutes are separate N- and C-terminal proteins, as it is the case for cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. Fig. 5.— Details of selected clades of the phylogenetic tree of cyt b. (a) Cyt b from the photosynthetic Heliobacteria, Chlorobi, Acidobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and chloroplasts carries PEWY as Qo motif. The photosynthetic label (hν) marks organisms which possess Photosystem I or bacterial type I reaction centers. Cyt b from acidophilic organisms of the PEWY-cyt c and PDWY-cyt c clades consistently shows PAWY. The position of cyt b from the deep branching Actinobacteria Rubrobacteridae is close to all Firmicutes cyt b homologs, whereas actinobacterial homologs from Actinobacteridae are associated with the Deinococcus–Thermus clade. (b) Clades which contain archaeal cyt b homologs. “Archaeal clades” in the text refer to Pyrobaculum, Korarchaeum, Thaumarchaeota, Thermoplasma, and Sulfolobus but not to haloarchaea, which cluster with the two bacterial phyla Deinococcus–Thermus and Actinobacteria. (c) Clades of cyt b which carry heme ci binding motifs. Lineages with experimental confirmed heme ci are marked with a tick, otherwise a question mark is shown. (d) Clades containing multiple copies of cyt b with distinct Qo motifs encoded by the same organism. The predicted range of the midpoint potential of the respective Rieske ISP of all cyt b branches is labeled as follows: Low: 150 mV; Mid−: around 200 mV; Mid+: around 260 mV; High: above 260 mV. Note that PDWY is only present in Low and Mid− Rieske ISP. Cyt b of the PDWF-FeS branch is fused to a non-Rieske type iron–sulfur (FeS) protein, and no Rieske ISP are found in the QcrABC cluster. In the RefSeq database, 618 actinobacterial cyt b homologs were identified, 613 are the full-length form of cyt b, whereas 5 are the split form (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). Notably, the C-terminal region of the full-length actinobacterial cyt b could not be detected by the profile hidden Markov model within the e-value threshold (1e-3) when all sequences from the RefSeq database were searched. However, multiple sequence alignment of all actinobacterial cyt b to the yeast homolog clearly showed 13 completely conserved residues within the N-terminal region, including the four axial ligands of the b hemes (data not shown), and Pro271, Tyr274, and Pro306 were completely conserved within the C-terminal region. Therefore, the Qo motif was clearly identified as PDWY, and the 613 sequences were grouped in to COB_NC’ (fig. 3). Apart from the 613 full-length actinobacterial cyt b grouped in COB_NC’, five pairs of split cyt b were found in Actinobacteria, which carry Glu272 (PEWY) or Pro272 (APWY) at the Qo motif (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). They were exclusively identified from three strains of the subclass Rubrobacteridae: Rubrobacter xylanophilus DSM 9941 (encoding two copies of cyt b homologs), Patulibacter sp. I11, and Conexibacter woesei DSM 14684 and one strain of the subclass Acidimicrobidae (Ilumatobacter coccineum YM16-304). Their representative sequences are clustered either to the PEWY-cyt c clade (fig. 5a) or to the APWY clade. These two subclasses are known to be deep branching Actinobacteria from systematics studies (Pukall et al. 2010). Therefore, these split cyt b should have evolved independently from the actinobacterial full-length cyt b. The latter is characteristic for the subclass Actinobacteridae and is clustered with Deinococcus–Thermus and haloarchaea (fig. 5b).Cyt b Homologs in Archaea Rieske ISP and cyt b are universally conserved in Bacteria and Archaea, therefore they are considered as the evolutionary core of cyt bc1 complexes (Schütz et al. 2000). Aeropyrum pernix and P. aerophilum possess a cyt c gene close to the Rieske-cyt b gene cluster. No cyt c genes were identified in Sulfolobales (Schmidt 2004) and Haloarchaea (Gonzalez et al. 2009). In these two genera, cyt b is part of the quinol oxidase supercomplex, which consists of the quinol oxidase module (cyt b, Rieske ISP), the oxygen reductase module (catalytic subunits of heme-copper oxidases), and a copper containing, membrane-bound protein which mediates electron transfer between the two modules. Haloarchaea encode both the full-length and the split form of cyt b, with PDWF and PDWY as their Qo motif, respectively (fig. 5b). The full-length haloarchaeal cyt b sequences cluster with homologs from Actinobacteria and Deinococcus–Thermus. In a sequence similarity search with all archaeal cyt b as query sequences and all bacterial cyt b as the customized database (performed as standalone NCBI BLAST), the highest identity (41%) was identified between the haloarcheal (Halococcus saccharolyticus DSM 5350, ZP_21711443) and the bacterial (Thermus scotoductus SA-01, YP_004056741) homologs, which clearly indicates the result of a horizontal gene transfer. This observation is in line with the hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer of bioenergetic gene clusters from bacteria to haloarchaea described for NADH dehydrogenase (nuo), menaquinone biosynthesis (men), and heme-copper oxidase (cox) of the archaea Halobacterium NRC-1 due to their high similarity in sequence composition and gene structures (Baymann et al. 2012; Nelson-Sathi et al. 2012). The thermoacidophilic Sulfolobales (Thermoprotei, fig. 4) encode three copies of cyt b homologs: SoxG, SoxC, and SoxN of the SoxMEFGHI, SoxABCD, and SoxNL-CbsAB quinol oxidase supercomplexes, respectively (Schäfer et al. 2001). Interestingly, PDWY was identified in SoxG, whereas SoxN and SoxC carry PPWF as Qo motif (fig. 5b). Cyt b from the genus Pyrobaculum were found to systematically lack the second histidine ligand of heme bH, which suggests the absence of that b-type heme (supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online). The Pyrobaculum cyt b shares the same common ancestor with all Thermoprotei homologs (fig. 5b), suggesting that the loss of one b-type heme occurred specifically in this genus. The only archaea which carry PEWY are the early branching Candidatus Korarchaeum cryptofilum OPF8 (YP_001737595) and two strains from the ammonia oxidizing Thaumarchaeota. Neither cyt c nor heme-copper oxidase subunits were identified in Candidatus Korarchaeum cryptofilum, and the quinone biosynthesis pathway is incomplete (Elkins et al. 2008). Unlike the Euryarchaeota haloarchaea, none of the sequences in the branches of Thermoprotei, Thermoplasma, and Thaumarchaeota show significant homology to bacterial homologs, so there is no indication for horizontal gene transfer in these branches. However, Thermoplasma is the only euryarchaeon identified in the archaeal clade and was clustered in the Thermoprotei branches, suggesting that their cyt bc1 complexes were probably acquired via intradomain horizontal gene transfer from other archaea.APWY, PPWY, and PAWY as Qo Motif Suggest Adaptation to Specific Environmental Conditions In all branches of the phylogenetic tree of cyt b analyzed above, each clade is composed of sequences from organisms of close phylogenetic origin, and therefore, a representative Qo motif at the level of phylum or class could be concluded. However, the APWY clade consists of cyt b from δ-Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirales, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, and two genera of deep-branching Firmicutes Symbiobacterium and Thermaerobacter (Ueda and Beppu 2007; Han et al. 2010) with APWY as Qo motif (supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). With the presence of proline on the second position of the Qo motif, the quinol substrate cannot be hydrogen bonded by the amino acid side chain, but it could be bound through water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the peptide backbone, as seen in a yeast cyt bc1 complex structure with the inhibitor HHDBT (Palsdottir et al. 2003). None of the homologous proteins carrying APWY as Qo motif have been characterized in vitro nor in vivo. However, in Geobacter metallireducens, such cyt bc1 complex forms a gene cluster with p-cresol methylhydroxylase (Peters et al. 2007), and it was proposed that the cyt bc1 complex would accept electrons from the oxidation of p-cresol for the reduction of the menaquinone pool by a reversed Q cycle mechanism (Johannes et al. 2008). Cyt bc1 complexes from the acidophilic γ-Proteobacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans carry PPWY as the Qo motif. They cluster with other γ-Proteobacteria, and therefore, this cyt b has most likely evolved independently from homologs in the APWY clade. The biochemical properties of A. ferrooxidans cyt bc1 complexes have been extensively studied (Brasseur et al. 2004). Acidophilic bacteria employ a variety of ion transport machineries to maintain their intracellular pH close to neutral usually at pH 6.5 (She et al. 2001), whereas the acidity of the periplasm is similar to the environmental pH (Elbehti et al. 1999). As the Qo site of cyt bc1 complex is close to the positive side of the plasmamembrane in prokaryotes, the Qo site is directly exposed to the periplasm when the extrinsic domain of the Rieske ISP changes conformation to transfer an electron to cyt c1 (Hunte et al. 2000). Low pH decreases the quinol cyt c reductase (QCR) activity of the yeast cyt bc1 complex. The pH dependence of the QCR activity is affected by the pKa of Glu272, which is 6.2 in the S. cereviseae enzyme (Wenz et al. 2006). The yeast E272P mutant, which mimics the Qo site of A. ferrooxidans, showed pH independent QCR activity (Seddiki et al. 2008). The mutant has 2-fold higher residual activity below pH 6 when compared with that of the wild-type protein and of the E272V mutant (Seddiki et al. 2008). We suggest that Pro272 is a result of low pH adaptation of cyt bc1 complexes from acidophilic bacteria, as the native cyt bc1 complex in A. ferrooxidans operates typically at pH of 3.5 (Brasseur et al. 2004). The catalytic role of the missing Glu272 might be replaced by the Glu253 conserved in these organisms. Noteworthily, we identified several alkaliphilic γ-Proteobacteria carrying lysine instead of glutamate at the 253rd position (supplementary fig. S4, Supplementary Material online), and a high pKa value of the amino acid at this position might permit proton transfer at high environmental pH. Therefore, residues that could mediate proton transfer appear to have evolved under the pressure of the environmental pH of the organisms. Interestingly, the absence of a carboxylic side chain at the second position of the Qo motif was also identified in the acidophilic Nitrospirae Leptospirillum ferrooxidans and in the Firmicute Desulfosporosinus acidiphilus, which are important for acid mine drainage (Schrenk et al. 1998; Alazard et al. 2010). However, their cyt b are clustered in PEWY-cyt c and PDWY-cyt c clades, respectively, with PAWY as Qo motif (fig. 5a), suggesting that PAWY could be an independent adaptation of the cyt bc1 complexes, which operate at acidic environment.Multiple Copies of cyt b Encoded by Single Organism Carry Distinct Qo Motifs Similar to the APWY clade, the PEWY-cyt c and PDWY-cyt c clades are also composed of cyt b from various phylogenetic origins, including Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Nitrospira, and Verrucomicrobia. In this clade, 29 out of 33 sequences are fused with a class I cyt c domain at their C-terminal end. The lineage complexity of the APWY, PEWY-cyt c, and PDWY-cyt c clades is mainly due to the fact that several organisms encode multiple copies of cyt b. As these phyla are not phylogenetically close while sharing similar cyt b, homologous sequences were likely distributed through horizontal gene transfer. With the increase in number of genomic sequences available, the feature of possessing multiple cyt bc1 complexes in one species has been discovered by recent phylogenetic analyses, but the reason remains unclear (Baymann et al. 2012; Dibrova et al. 2013; ten Brink et al. 2013). Our study unambiguously revealed that these multiple cyt b carry distinct Qo motifs. For instance, both Blastopirellula marina DSM 3645 and Candidatus Solibacter usitatus Ellin6076 possess three cyt b homologs, which, respectively, carry APWY, PDWY, and PEWY as Qo motif. Therefore, these cyt bc1 complexes might be capable of catalyzing quinol oxidation under different physiological conditions, for instance, to cover a wide range of extracellular pH or with preferential reverse reaction, according to our analysis. The GPWY clade (fig. 4) is composed of cyt b from δ-Proteobacteria, Ignavibacteria, and Nitrospinae carrying GPWY or GPWF as Qo motif. Although the nonphotosynthetic, nonautotrophic bacteria Ignavibacteria are phylogenetically close to the photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobi) (Podosokorskaya et al. 2013), their cyt b are located in distinct branches of the cyt b tree. The cyt b of Ignavibacterium album carries GPWY and is fused to a triheme cytochrome c7 domain (YP_005846642), whereas the cyt b of Chlorobium phaeobacteroides carries PEWY and is close to other photosynthetic organisms on the tree. There are three branches of cyt b carrying PDWF and PDWY within the GPWY clade. Notably, two cyt b from Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 and Turneriella parva DSM 21527 carry a 4Fe-4S binding domain and a methyl-viologen-reducing hydrogenase delta subunit, and one cyt b from Alicycliphilus denitrificans BC is fused to a ferredoxin and flavin oxidoreductase domain. As the result, these branches are named as the PDWF-FeS clade (fig. 4). These data suggest that not only the four-helical N-terminal heme-binding region of cyt b is a universal electron transfer module (Baymann et al. 2003; Dibrova et al. 2013), but the whole cyt b subunit including the Qo motif can be a part of other bioenergetic complexes.The Binding Motif of Heme ci The presence of a c-type heme in the Qi site of cyt b (heme ci) is a specific characteristic for cyt b6f complexes. Heme ci mediates electron transfer from heme bH to the quinone substrate. Unlike conventional c-type hemes which are covalently attached to the protein with two thioether bonds via the CxxCH motif, heme ci binds to the protein via only one thioether bond to Cys35 of cyt b6 (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii numbering, Stroebel et al. 2003). CxGG is suggested as its binding motif, in which the C corresponds to Cys35 (Dibrova et al. 2013). The phylogenetic tree of COB_50 showed that this CxGG motif is exclusively present in Firmicutes, chloroplasts, Cyanobacteria (cyanobacterial b6 are all clustered with chloroplast homologs by CD-HIT, and only representatives from chloroplasts were chosen), and the APWY clade. Notably, these motifs are contributed by the N-terminal proteins of split cyt b (supplementary tables S5–S7, Supplementary Material online). The alignment of all representative sequences of N-terminal proteins of cyt b showed that the first glycine of the CxGG motif is completely conserved, but Cys35 is not (supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online). This alignment points out another interesting feature: The nonphotosynthetic Firmicutes genus Desulfitobacterium uses FCFGG, the genus Bacillus shows YCFGG, and the anaerobic photosynthetic Heliobacterium modesticaldum has YCLGG as the heme ci binding motif (fig. 5c). The latter is identical to that of cyt b6 of Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. Sequences from the APWY clade carrying the CxGG motif are mostly in the form of WCMGG. So far, the presence of heme ci is only biochemically characterized in Bacillus (Yu and Le Brun 1998), heliobacteria (Ducluzeau et al. 2008), and oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. According to our data, the tyrosine residue just upstream of the CxGG motif in these organisms is also completely conserved (supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online). As this tyrosine is in direct proximity to heme bH (Stroebel et al. 2003), we suggest that the general conservation of this tyrosine may be important for the Qi site. In addition, whether WCMGG of cyt b from the APWY clade binds heme ci needs to be experimentally verified.Photosynthetic Organisms Which Use PSI or Type I RC Exclusively Show PEWY as Qo Motif PEWY as Qo motif is not only identified in the respective proteobacterial and mitochondrial clades but also in cyt bc1 or b6f complexes from Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts, as well as in the anaerobic anoxygenic photosynthetic heliobacteria and green-sulfur bacteria (Chlorobi), and in the aerobic photosynthetic Acidobacteria Candidatus Chloroacidobacterium thermophilum (supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online). Interestingly, in these organisms, cyt bc1 or b6f complexes donate electrons to Photosystem I (PSI) or type I reaction center (type I RC) (Hohmann-Marriott and Blankenship 2011). In bacteria which exclusively use type II reaction center (type II RC), the Qo motif of their cyt bc1 complexes are PEWY (α-Proteobacteria) or PVWY (β-Proteobacteria). Cyt b6f complexes from chloroplast and Cyanobacteria form a single clade and two closely related Clostridia, heliobacteria, and desulfitobacteria constitute another branch (fig. 5a, labeled with Heliobacteria). Heliobacterium is the only genus that carrys PEWY among Firmicutes, whereas most Firmicutes use PDWY (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). The close sequence homology of cyanobacterial and heliobacterial cyt b is the basis of the hypothesis that the cyanobacterial cyt b6f complexes evolved from cyt b of a common ancestor shared with Gram-positive bacteria (Nitschke et al. 2010). The presence of PEWY in heliobacteria might be answered by comparing its electron transfer system to that of desulfitobacteria, which also belong to the class Clostridia and comprise the same branch as heliobacteria, while carrying PDWY as Qo motif (fig. 5a). Both species are obligate anaerobes (Villemur et al. 2006). The terminal electron acceptor of the desulfitobacteria is nitric oxide reductase, which belongs to the heme-copper oxidase superfamily, whereas that of the heliobacteria is type I RC (Hohmann-Marriott and Blankenship 2011). Redox reactions of heliobacterial cyt bc1 complex and type I RC are coupled by the mobile carrier cyt c553, as stigmatellin inhibits the flash-induced oxidation of b hemes of the complex (Kramer et al. 1997). Cyt c553 is oxidized by P798+ of type I RC at a physiological rate of 100–700 μs in line with a temperature-dependent collisional reaction (Nitschke et al. 1995; Oh-oka 2007). In contrast, the steady-state turnover number of the nitric oxide reductase is in the magnitude of 100 per second, regardless if cyt c or an artificial reductant was used as electron donor (Hino et al. 2010). It is tempting to speculate that heliobacteria need a faster reduction of cyt c by cyt bc1 complex for the photooxidized type I RC when compared with the nonphotosynthetic species such as desulfitobacteria. This could be achieved by the increase of the catalytic capability of their cyt bc1 complex with Asp272 substituted by Glu272, as indicated by the mutational studies for the cyt bc1 complex from yeast (Wenz et al. 2006) and from R. capsulatus (Gennis et al. 1993). The wild-type enzyme with Glu272 at the Qo site provides 2- to 4-fold higher steady-state turnover rate of the QCR activity when compared with the E272D variant.The Split Form of cyt b Evolved Independently in Some Proteobacteria Cyt b encoded as separate N- and C-terminal polypeptides is not only observed in Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and haloarchaea but a few of such sequences were also identified in Proteobacteria (supplementary table S11, Supplementary Material online). Split cyt b (ZP_01678359 and ZP_01678350) were observed in the γ-proteobacterium Vibrio cholerae 2740-80. The Qo motif is PVWY and the His253 equivalent residue is glutamate. The presence of hydrophobic residues on the second position of the Qo motif in combination with conserved Glu253 is the general feature of β- and γ-Proteobacteria (supplementary tables S1 and S11, Supplementary Material online). Sequence similarity analysis (BLAST) indicated these sequences are more similar to proteobacterial cyt b than to Cyanobacteria or Firmicutes (data not shown). Split cyt b are also seen in the ε-Proteobacterium Campylobacter coli RM2228, the α-Proteobacterium Ketogulonicigenium vulgare Y25, and the δ-Proteobacterium G. metallireducens GS-15. No potential ligand for heme ci is present in these homologs. The sequence of the N-terminal protein of split cyt b from V. cholerae 2740-80 (ZP_01678359) is 100% identical to the N-terminal region of the full length cyt b from V. cholerae O1 biovar El Tor str. N16961 (NP_230225). The close homology of these split cyt b in Proteobacteria to their full-length form suggests that the separation of genes encoding the N- and C-terminal region of cyt b happened as independent events (supplementary fig. S5, Supplementary Material online).DiscussionEarly Evolution of cyt bc1 Complexes The archaeal clade of the cyt b tree contains no bacterial homologs as described above (fig. 5b). The only archaeal cyt b outside this clade are from haloarchaea, which cluster with cyt b from Deinococcus–Thermus and Actinobacteria. There is genomic evidence that genes of the bioenergetic proteins of haloarchaea were largely acquired from bacteria via horizontal gene transfer (Baymann et al. 2012; Nelson-Sathi et al. 2012). Thus, we conclude that archaeal cyt b genes with the exception of haloarchaea have no bacterial origin. Archaea employ the copper proteins halocyanin or sulfocyanin instead of class I cyt c to mediate electron transfer between the Rieske ISP and terminal oxidases (Schmidt 2004; Gonzalez et al. 2009). The cyt c1 subunit of bacterial cyt bc1 complexes, also a class I cyt c, should thus have evolved after the split of archaea and bacteria. On the basis of these observations, our phylogenetic analysis agrees with the suggestion that the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) would have possessed Rieske ISP and cyt b, two of the three catalytic subunits of cyt bc1 complex (Baymann et al. 2012). In this context, cyt b from Deinococcus–Thermus is the deepest branching bacterial homolog, and it groups with cyt b from the Actinomycetales subclass of the phylogenetically distant Actinobacteria. We suggest that Actinomycetales obtained the cyt b subunit of cyt bc1 complex similar to haloarchaea by horizontal gene transfer. In Rubrobacteridae, the basal subclass of Actinobacteria according to 16s rRNA analysis (Pukall et al. 2010), cyt b is split and its C-terminal protein is fused to a class I cyt c domain. It shares the same origin with cyt b from phylogenetically closer Firmicutes (both Firmicutes and Actinobacteria are Gram positive) of the PEWY-cyt c/ PDWY-cyt c clades (fig. 5a). This indicates two independent origins of actinobacterial cyt b. As shown above, the split of N- and C-terminal region of cyt b happened several times independently in different clades, as also suggested previously (Baymann et al. 2012). The absence of the split form of cyt b in the archaeal clade and in the deep branching bacterial homologs indicates that cyt b of the LUCA was most likely a single peptide with both N- and C-terminal regions. This conclusion is contradictory to a recent proposal (Dibrova et al. 2013), which suggests that ancient cyt bc1 complexes needed high potential electron acceptors (at least 100 mV), so that cyt bc1 complexes would have evolved after emergence of atmospheric oxygen poising the extracellular environment more oxidized. However, aerobic respiration that uses oxygen as terminal electron acceptor (O2/H2O = 800 mV) evolved before oxygenic photosynthesis (Castresana and Saraste 1995). In addition, the newly discovered pathway of oxygen production by anaerobic methane oxidation in Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera indicates that oxygen might have been available to microbial metabolism before oxygenic photosynthesis (Ettwig et al. 2010). Furthermore, with nitric oxide (NO/N2O = 1,000 mV), a strong oxidant was present in the anaerobic pre-LUCA age, and ancestral cyt bc1 complexes could have donated electrons to the respective terminal oxidases (Ducluzeau et al. 2009). Finally, it has recently been reported that menaquinone can be synthesized from an alternate futalosine pathway in bacteria and archaea. This pathway likely predated the classical menaquinone biosynthesis pathway (Zhi et al. 2014). Further comparison of the occurrence of quinone reducing and quinol oxidizing enzymes as well as of quinone biosynthetic pathways is needed to reconstruct the primordial respiratory chains.The Link between Qo Motif and Quinone Species PEWY as Qo motif is characteristic for proteobacterial and mitochondrial clades, comprising the major branches of α-Proteobacteria and mitochondria, as well as for the early branching δ-, ε-Proteobacteria, and Aquificae. In these clades, Qo motifs other than PEWY are only present in terminal branches (fig. 4 and supplementary tables S3 and S4, Supplementary Material online), and therefore, they are most likely derived from the PEWY pattern. In this context, β- and γ-Proteobacteria that carry PVWY with a conserved glutamate at the 253rd position and PPWY in the acidophilic proteobacteria evolved as independent adaptations. Two mitochondrial cyt b from Ctenophore carry the PDWY motif (supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). Interestingly, their mitochondrial genomes are highly divergent in respect to other eukaryotes (Pett et al. 2011; Kohn et al. 2012), therefore we regard these two sequences as the only two exceptions among mitochondrial cyt b. Cyt b6f complexes from Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts also carry PEWY and no single exception with aspartate at the second position of the Qo motif was found in this study. Noteworthily, PEWY is the signature Qo motif for high potential quinone species used in respiratory and photosynthetic electron transfer chains, and thus for α-Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. It has been proposed that low potential menaquinone (Em7 −80 mV) is an ancient form of quinone, when compared with the high potential ubiquinone (Em7 +90 mV, Takamiya and Dutton 1979) and plastoquinone (Em7 +110 mV, Wood and Bendall 1976). The high potential quinones evolved after the increase of oxygen concentration in the atmosphere (Schoepp-Cothenet et al. 2009; Hohmann-Marriott and Blankenship 2011). For organisms which can employ both ubiquinone and menaquinone in their electron transfer chains, ubiquinone is the major species under aerobic conditions, whereas menaquinone is used under anaerobic conditions (Bekker et al. 2010). The appearance of ubiquinone in evolution is dated after the divergence of δ- and ε-Proteobacteria and prior to the emergence of γ-, β-, and α-Proteobacteria. The first two subphyla employ exclusively menaquinone, whereas the last two subphyla use ubiquinone. γ-Proteobacteria are considered as ambivalent (Schoepp-Cothenet et al. 2009). This scheme is strongly supported by the observation that the potential energy difference between quinone species and cyt bc1 complex is constant: cyt bc1 complexes with low potential Rieske ISC (Em7 +120 mV) use low potential quinones as substrate, and those with high potential Rieske ISC (Em7 +300 mV) use high potential quinones as substrate (Baymann and Nitschke 2010; Nitschke et al. 2010). In line with this hypothesis, in photosynthetic organisms in which plastoquinone emerged with the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis, the strictly anaerobic heliobacteria utilize menaquinone. Interestingly, by correlating the quinone species with the Qo motif, we found that there is a general absence of PDWY in the high potential ubiquinone and plastoquinone metabolizing organisms. Cyt bc1 or b6f complexes from these species carry PEWY as Qo motif. On first sight, the SoxMEFGHI supercomplex from acidothermophilic archaea Sulfolobales does not fit to this scheme, as the cyt b homologous protein SoxG carries PDWY, whereas Sulfolobales use the high potential Caldariella quinone (Em +103 mV at pH 6.5, Em +343 mV at pH 2.5, Schmidt 2004). In the same clade of the cyt b tree, SoxG is also found in Thermoplasma acidophilum and T. volcanium. Different from Sulfolobales, Thermoplasma are not acidophilic, and they use the low potential menaquinone and its methylated derivative thermoplasma quinone (Collins 1985). The optimal pH for the growth of Sulfolobus ranges from 1 to 5 (Schäfer et al. 1999), but the optimal pH for the activity of isolated SoxMEFGHI supercomplex is 5.3, which is close to the cytosolic pH of Sulfolobales (Komorowski et al. 2002). The activity of mitochondrial cyt bc1 complex is pH dependent in vitro, because the open conformation of the Rieske ISP exposes the Qo site to the bulk solvent (which is equivalent to the environment of intermembrane space or periplasm in vivo), and the Qo motif is subject to direct protonation by the low pH (Wenz et al. 2006). The soluble domain of the Rieske ISP of Sox MEFGHI complex (SoxF) has a different orientation to the membrane anchor when compared with the mitochondrial cyt bc1 complex (Bönisch et al. 2002). It is likely that this conformation of SoxF together with the PDWY motif of SoxG provides the optimal working pH of the whole complex and accommodates the specific Caldariella quinone (De Rosa et al. 1977), which contains unique thiophene and methylthio substitutions at the benzylquinone ring. The optimal pH for energy conversion and the specific substrate would have become a stronger selection pressure than the increase of atmosphere oxygen tension for Sulfolobus, thus the PDWY motif was not replaced by PEWY, when the high potential Caldariella quinone emerged.The Parallel Evolution of Quinone Species, Qo Motif, and Rieske ISP Both, cyt b and Rieske ISP, participate in the catalysis of quinol oxidation. An evaluation of the evolution of the key step of the Q cycle has to consider both catalytic subunits and the type of quinone substrate. It was suggested that multiple copies of Rieske ISP identified in one organism often have different midpoint potentials, suggesting that the respective enzymes may operate under different redox conditions (ten Brink et al. 2013). We have shown earlier in this article that multiple copies of cyt b encoded by a single organism carry distinct Qo motifs. They are found in PEWY-cyt c, PDWY-cyt c, Chlorobi/NC10/Acidobacteria, APWY, and GPWY clades. It is thus intriguing to ask whether there is a correlation between the type of Qo motif of cyt b and the midpoint potential of the corresponding Rieske ISP. We therefore constructed the phylogenetic tree of Rieske ISP from the aforementioned clades of cyt b. Rieske ISP from heliobacteria and desulfitobacteria were also incorporated because of their proximity on the phylogenetic tree to these clades (fig. 4). Caldithrix abysssi encodes two cyt b, which are clustered to the GPWY clade and the chloroplast/Cyanobacteria clade, thus all sequences of the latter clade were also subjected to analysis. The corresponding Rieske ISP subunits of each cyt b were identified from the respective QcrABC (or the equivalent PetABCD) clusters. Because of the so far limited biochemical and structural data of archaeal respiratory chains, archaeal Rieske ISP was not subjected to analysis in comparison with cyt b and quinone species. Notably, the composition of clades of the Rieske ISP tree is in accordance with the one of their cyt b counterparts (figs. 5d and 6). Moreover, each clade is characterized by a distinct range of midpoint potentials of Rieske ISP. The latter can be deduced from the so called signature motifs, which are the second and the fourth amino acid residues downstream the strictly conserved CxCH motif, which provides two disulfide bonds to the iron–sulfur cluster (ten Brink et al. 2013): G-F and S-Y represent low (around 150 mV) and high (above 260 mV) potential Rieske ISP, respectively. In the medium range, S-F (Mid+), G-Y, and A-Y (Mid−) indicate the decreasing midpoint potential in the given order. The electrochemical property of Rieske ISP provides the link between the Qo motif and Rieske ISP. Rieske ISP correlated with cyt b carrying APWY and GPWY exclusively range from Mid+ to high potential and are located at the lower part of the nonrooted Rieske ISP tree (fig. 6). Rieske ISP coupled with cyt b from PDWY-cyt c, Heliobacteria/Desulfitobacteria, and Chlorobi/NC10/Acidobacteria clades are exclusively ranged from low to Mid− potential and are located in the middle parts of the tree. At the upper part of the tree are Rieske ISP coupled with cyt b from the PEWY-cyt c clade. Their midpoint potential covers the whole span of the predicted range (fig. 6). Fig. 6.— The phylogenetic tree of Rieske ISP. The unrooted tree of Rieske ISP from organisms in PEWY-cyt c, PDWY-cyt c, APWY, GPWF, Chlorobi/NC10/Acidobacteria, Heliobacteria, and chloroplasts/Cyanobacteria clades of cyt b (fig. 4) was calculated with the Bayesian inference method by MrBayes. The color of each branch is identical to their cyt b counterparts in figure 4, and the type of Rieske ISP according to their predicted midpoint potential (Low: 150 mV; Mid−: around 200 mV; Mid+: around 260 mV; High: above 260 mV) are summarized next to the clades. Detailed annotation including accession numbers, tip labels, branching probabilities, and predicted reduction potentials are provided in supplementary figure S6 and tables S13–S15, Supplementary Material online. The signature motif of Rieske ISP and Qo motif of cyt b from organisms which encode multiple copies of cyt bc1 complexes are summarized in supplementary table S12, Supplementary Material online. The clear distinction of Rieske ISP which are coupled to cyt b with PEWY or PDWY from those Rieske ISP which are coupled to cyt b with APWY or GPWY as Qo motif illustrates that there are two distinct systems of cyt bc1 complexes. As shown earlier in this article, APWY as Qo motif is characteristic for cyt bc1 complexes operating in reverse direction with electron input from the high potential chain. Because of the lack of biochemical characterization of such complexes, only cyt bc1 complexes with PEWY and PDWY as Qo motif can be discussed to date. Our analysis clearly indicates that bacterial cyt bc1 complexes with PDWY in their cyt b are only present in menaquinol oxidizing organisms. The biochemical basis of this observation is reflected in the topology of the phylogenetic tree of Rieske ISP. Cyt b with PDWY is exclusively coupled with low and Mid− potential Rieske ISP. Therefore, only menaquinol instead of ubiquinol is able to provide sufficient free energy to reduce such ISPs. In contrast, the high potential ubiquinone is the major quinone species in α-Proteobacteria and mitochondria. These organisms or organelles use high potential Rieske ISP as electron acceptors for ubiquinol (Schoepp-Cothenet et al. 2009), and according to our analysis, their cyt b have PEWY as Qo motif (fig. 4). The strictly anaerobic heliobacteria and green sulfur bacteria carry PEWY but use a low potential redox system and menaquinone for anoxygenic photosynthesis. It is likely that their Qo motif evolved independently to couple electron transfer with type I reaction center. The close phylogenetic position of heliobacteria (PEWY) and the nonphotosynthetic desulfitobacteria (PDWY) supports this interpretation. Figure 7 summarizes our observation of the correlation of Qo motif of cyt b, quinone species, and the midpoint potential of Rieske ISP. The intriguing correlation between the proton/electron carrying quinol substrate, the electron acceptor, and the protonable quinol oxidation motif is best interpreted as the consequence of adaptation to high oxygen concentration. High potential electron transport systems evolved in adaptation to the increasing atmospheric oxygen concentration generated by oxygenic photosynthesis. It is likely that the cyt bc1 complex with both highest redox potential Rieske ISP and PEWY as Qo motif emerged after the high potential ubiquinone evolved and that PDWY is the primitive form of the Qo motif as it only exists in low potential systems. Replacing PEWY by PDWY in ubiquinol oxidizing cyt bc1 complexes lowers the quinol-cyt c reductase activity (Gennis et al. 1993; Wenz et al. 2006) and increases the level of reactive oxygen species (Wenz et al. 2006). The concentration of the latter correlates with bypass reactions and the lifetime of semiquinone in the Qo site (Osyczka et al. 2005; Cape et al. 2006). The side chain of Glu272 appears to provide an optimal environment for a low stability constant of ubisemiquinone in the Qo site preventing accumulation of semiquinone. This is in line with the hypothesis that a distinct Qo motif is used in a specific redox system as to minimize bypass reactions of quinol oxidation. Fig. 7.— The correlation between Qo motif of cyt b, Rieske ISP, and quinone species suggests a parallel evolution. The scheme summarizes the correlation of Qo motif of cyt b with midpoint potential of Rieske ISP and high (90 mV ubiquinone) and low (−80 mV menaquinone) potential substrates. Characteristic for mitochondrial and α-proteobacterial cyt bc1 complexes is ubiquinone as substrate, PEWY as Qo motif, and high potential Rieske ISP (top panel). The second group comprises bacterial cyt bc1 complexes with PEWY that use menaquinone as substrate and have Rieske ISP which cover the whole span of midpoint potential (the middle two panels). Interestingly, bacterial cyt bc1 complexes with PDWY as Qo motif use menaquinone as substrate and have lower potential Rieske ISP (bottom panel). We propose that during the evolution from low to high potential electron transfer systems, cyt bc1 complexes with cyt b carrying PEWY as Qo motif with high potential quinones and Rieske ISP emerged, whereas cyt b with PDWY as Qo motif operates best with low potential quinones and Rieske ISP and was likely to be the composition in the ancestral cyt bc1 complex. The isoprenoid chain of quinones is omitted for clarity. In addition to the quinones discussed here that are present in most of the organisms (Collins and Jones 1981), there are several quinones with redox midpoint potential between ubiquinone and menaquinone, which occur in a narrower spectrum of organisms, for instance, rhodoquinone (Em7 = −63 mV, Lonjers et al. 2012) and demethylmenaquinone (Em7 = −9 mV, Infossi et al. 2010). Presumably, cyt bc1 complexes which could use these substrates have optimized their quinol oxidation for specific environmental adaptation. For instance, the low potential rhodoquinone, present in some α- and β-Proteobacteria and in a few eukaryotes (Tielens et al. 2002; Müller et al. 2012), is in these organisms the major quinone under anaerobic conditions, whereas ubiquinone is used under aerobic conditions (Müller et al. 2012; Sakai et al. 2012). In conclusion, the catalysis of quinol oxidation appears to be fine-tuned through coevolution of Rieske ISP, quinone species, and Qo motif. The distinct patterns of the Qo motif may modulate electron and proton transfer via the quinol binding mode to cope with oxygen stress. Analysis of electron bifurcation and bypass reactions in cyt bc1 complexes from yeast mutants that mimic β- and γ-proteobacterial and actinobacterial homologs is ongoing to decipher the underlying structure/function relationships.Supplementary Material Supplementary figures S1–S6 and tables S1–S15 are available at Genome Biology and Evolution online (http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/).

Although parasites harm their hosts, it is in the best interest of the parasite not to kill the host because the parasite relies on the host body functions, such as digestion or blood circulation, to survive. Thus, parasites have evolved in the direction of maximizing efficiency but not affecting their host systems. Parasites, especially helminthic parasites cause countless morbidity, but the mortality for the parasitic diseases is very low [1]. Trichinella spiralis is a relatively small nematode that causes infections in host skeletal muscle and modifies and utilizes the host system very efficiently. The life cycle of T. spiralis begins with the enteral phase of infection when a person or an animal eats contaminated meat containing first stage muscle larvae. Digestive juices including pepsin and hydrochloric acid dissolve the capsule-like cyst and release the larvae. The larvae then pass into the small intestine and mature to adults that mate to produce newborn larvae (immature L1). Newborn larvae are passed into the tissue and enter the lymphatic system and blood vessels for subsequent body-wide distribution. The larvae eventually extravasate into the muscle fibers, which initiate the muscle phase of infection. Once in the muscle fibers, the larvae encyst, undergo development, become infective within 15 days, and remain for months to years [2,3].2.Nurse Cell Formation and Angiogenesis After T. spiralis enters the muscle cell, a morphologically changed portion of infected myocytes are directed to develop into nurse cells that presumably function to nourish the parasite as well as to protect it from the host immune response. The nurse cell-parasite complex is surrounded by a collagen capsule consisting predominantly of two collagen types, IV and VI, both of which are synthesized by the nurse cell. The parasite begins to secrete proteins within the matrix of the infected host muscle cell 7 days after infection and the onset of host collagen type IV and type VI mRNA synthesis is also initiated between 7 and 8 days after infection. Collagen type IV synthesis then ceases on about 26 days after infection, while the expression of type VI collagen still remains throughout the infection at a low level [4,5]. In order to maintain a long-term host-parasite relationship, the parasite must remain metabolically active by maintaining nutrient acquisition and appropriate waste disposal. T. spiralis accomplishes these two tasks by attracting a highly permeable set of blood vessels to the surface of the outer collagen capsule. In this way, the larvae are assured a constant source of small molecular weight metabolites while also removing metabolic products from their environment. T. spiralis accomplishes this is by the initiation of angiogenesis. Baruch and Despommier [6] conducted transcardial perfusion along with the injection of a plastic that polymerized in situ in T. spiralis-infected mice to find that simple, complex, and hypercomplex vascular networks were found only around infected myocytes. They suggested that the vascular retes are the result of de novo angiogenesis induced during infection and that the parasite may elicit angiogenesis directly through secretion of unique products or may elicit a change in the nurse cells that in turn results in the growth of new blood vessels. Capó et al. [7] first showed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic stimulator, was induced by T. spiralis infection. They found that both VEGF mRNA and VEGF peptide were detected in the developing nurse cell cytoplasm from day 7 up to 16 months after infection. In addition, VEGF was also detected in cells in the area immediately surrounding the nurse cells on days 15 and 17. They also proposed that hypoxia is induced by T. spiralis within the developing nurse cells some time prior to the up-regulation of VEGF, perhaps as early as day 7, and a constant state of hypoxia is maintained to explain the continued presence of VEGF in nurse cells [5,7]. However, no further studies were conducted to prove that the hypoxic condition actually occurs in the course of nurse cell formation. In addition, it is still unknown whether hypoxia stimulates the expression of VEGF mRNA and VEGF peptide in T. spiralis-infected nurse cells. Taken together, hypoxia seems to be the key clue to solving the action mechanism of angiogenic induction in T. spiralis-infected nurse cells.3.Hypoxia and VEGF Induction in T. spiralis-Infected Nurse Cells From the early stages of muscle infection, angiogenic induction in T. spiralis-infected nurse cells is mediated by elevated VEGF levels [7]. Therefore, identifying how VEGF is induced in T. spiralis-infected nurse cells can elucidate the action mechanism of angiogenic induction by parasite infection. Hypoxia is a major inducer of VEGF expression in almost all cell types examined. Transcriptional up-regulation of VEGF is mediated by the specific binding of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) to the VEGF promoter hypoxic response element (HRE). The HIF-1 transcription factor is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β [8]. Whereas HIF-1β levels are constitutive, HIF-1α is degraded under normoxic conditions. The regulation of HIF-1α stability is a complex process. During oxygen-dependent activity, HIF-1α activity and stability are controlled differently on the basis of normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α activity is prevented through HIF hydroxylation and the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) binds to hydroxylated HIF-1α. pVHL bound to HIF-1α generates a complex by the binding of elongin-C, elongin-B, cullin-2, and ring-box 1 (RBX1) of E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets HIF-1α for ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome [9,10]. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α hydroxylation is prevented and unhydroxylated HIF-1α cannot bind pVHL; therefore, pVHL accumulates in the cell. Accumulated HIF-1α translocates to the nucleus and heterodimerizes with HIF-1β to bind to HRE regions on nuclear DNA to promote the transcription of target genes involved in cell growth, angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, pH regulation, and cell survival/apoptosis [9,10]. During oxygen-independent activity, pVHL-independent HIF degradation occurs. HIF-1α degradation is mainly regulated by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which protects proteins from misfolding and degradation through its ATPase activity. The receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (RACK1), a novel HIF-1α-interacting protein, can promote proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF-1α in an oxygen-independent manner and competes with HSP90 to bind to the PAS-A domain of HIF-1α [9,10]. HSP90 binding stabilizes HIF-1α by excluding RACK1, which binds elongin-C and recruits elongin-B and other components of E3 ubiquitin ligase to HIF-1α [9,10]. Even though hypoxia is the major stimulator of VEGF expression and angiogenesis, hypoxia independent regulation of VEGF also exists via the modulation of HIF-1α stability in an oxygen independent manner or HIF independent regulation of VEGF expression [10].4.Thymosin β4 and T. spiralis Infection We previously reported that thymosin β4, a major factor that induces VEGF, showed increased expression in muscle fibers 10 days after T. spiralis infection at both mRNA and protein level, and VEGF expression remained high in nurse cells for 6 weeks when the formation of the nurse cell complex was completed [11,12]. Thymosin β4 is an actin sequestering protein that has been reported to be a multi-functional protein with various biological roles, such as promoting angiogenesis [13–15], tumor metastasis [12,16–19], wound healing [20,21], hair growth [22,23], anti-apoptotic [24,25], and anti-inflammatory [26,27] effects. Our previous study showed that VEGF was up-regulated in thymosin β4 over-expressing B16-F10 lung tumor cells [13]. Conversely, down-regulation of VEGF was observed in situ in thymosin β4 knockdown hearts, suggesting that appropriate VEGF expression may require thymosin β4 [28]. Furthermore, we also found that thymosin β4 induces the expression of VEGF under normoxic conditions by increasing HIF-1α protein stability [29]. Therefore, increased levels of thymosin β4 in T. spiralis-infected nurse cells may increase VEGF levels to stimulate angiogenesis.5.Hypoxia, HIF-1α, and VEGF in T. spiralis-Infected Nurse Cells Our previous report also showed that hypoxic conditions are not present in T. spiralis-infected nurse cells. We used piminodazole hydrochloride, a chemical detector of hypoxic place, to find hypoxic condition in infected nurse cells. As the results of immunofluorescence with dual primary antibodies of anti-piminodazole hydrochloride and anti-HIF-1α, hypoxic conditions were not detected in nurse cells but were detected in accumulated lymphocytes surrounding nurse cells, particularly in degenerating nurse cells [11]. HIF-1α expression patterns were co-localized with hypoxic places suggesting hypoxia does not occur in T. spiralis-infected nurse cells but is present in the crowd of lymphocytes. The HIF-1α protein levels were dramatically increased from 21 days after infection until 42 days after infection, also suggesting the hypoxia is not related VEGF induction in nurse cells [11]. VEGF protein was also detected in the crowd of lymphocytes and the elevation of VEGF in late infection stages may be caused by hypoxic induction in the crowd of lymphocytes. Other growth factors including fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1, FGF-2, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), which stimulate angiogenesis, were also checked. Only FGF-1 was increased in early stage infection and other growth factors such as FGF-2 and IGF-1 were highly induced from 14 days after infection. The expression of EGF did not change in any stage of T. spiralis infection. These data suggest that FGF-1 could be involved in angiogenic stimulation during nurse cell formation and FGF-2 and IGF-1 may be related with inflammation by lymphocyte accumulation [11].6.Conclusions and Future Studies According to these data, we suggest that the induction of thymosin β4 in early stages of infection stimulates expression of VEGF to induce angiogenesis in early stage nurse cells. Induction of FGF-1also stimulates angiogenesis and the induction of angiogenesis can supply oxygen to nurse cells through a mechanism other than the hypoxic state (Figure 1). At late stages of infection, inflammation around infected nurse cells occurs and lymphocytes accumulate around the damaged nurse cells. The hypoxic condition, due to the accumulation of lymphocytes, protects HIF-1α from hydroxylation and degradation resulting in the transcriptional activation of VEGF expression. Other factors including FGF-2 and IGF-1 may also be involved in inflammation or the hypoxic stimulation of gene expression (Figure 1). However, several unsolved questions still remain. First, there is no direct evidence demonstrating that thymosin β4 actually mediates the angiogenic stimulation in nurse cell formation. Direct induction of VEGF by thymosin β4 in nurse cell formation should be confirmed. In addition, the effect of thymosin β4 over-expression or knock down in animal model on VEGF expression and angiogenesis in nurse cell formation should be examined. These studies can probe the direct involvement of thymosin β4 in VEGF expression and angiogenesis during nurse cell formation. Furthermore, how T. spiralis infection can stimulate thymosin β4 in nurse cells should also be studied to elucidate the action mechanism of thymosin β4 induction by parasite infection and also provide advanced knowledge about T. spiralis infection.

Diabetes rat models were induced with a low dose of STZ followed by a low dose of DMH to induce colorectal cancer. The formation of ACF in the colon and the incidence, number and size of tumors were measured. The activity of glycolytic enzymes in colonic tissues was also measured. The results demonstrated that both the total number of ACF and the number of foci that contain a different number of crypts were increased in diabetic rats. At the end of the experimental treatment, the incidence, number and size of tumors were also increased in diabetic rats. Overall, these data indicated that diabetes increased the risk of colorectal cancer. The activity of HK and PK in colonic tissues was increased in diabetic rats, whereas the activity of PDH was decreased. In addition, the activities of these enzymes in intratumor were higher than that of in peritumor.

It is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States [1], [2]. In recent years, with the improvement of living standards and lifestyle changes, the incidence of colorectal cancer has increased year by year in developing countries. Several similar risk factors have been found between diabetes mellitus and colorectal cancer. Those include a “Western Lifestyle”, with diets low in fruits and vegetables or fiber and high in fat and cooked meat, as well as restricted physical activity [3], [4]. Epidemiologic findings to date have shown that type 2 diabetes mellitus is closely related to the increased risk of colorectal cancer [3]–[8]. However, some results are inconsistent with this association because diabetes mellitus is a group of complex metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia. Several confounding factors, including duration of diabetes, varying levels of metabolic control, usage of different drugs for therapy, and the possible presence of chronic complications, complicate the accurate assessment of cancer risk in diabetic patients. In addition, different epidemic factors from different countries, ethnicities and regions may influence the association between diabetes and cancer [3],[7],[9]. The possible mechanisms involved in diabetes mellitus-related cancer may be associated with long-term insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, which have been extensively described to date [10]–[13]. Hyperinsulinemia may affect the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer through a variety of mechanisms. An abnormal increase of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the serum can lead to the occurrence of tumors by promoting the transformation and proliferation of colorectal epithelial cells, influencing the cell cycle and inhibiting cell apoptosis [10]. Patients treated with insulin for a long period of time have a higher risk of cancer, and with the increasing duration of insulin treatment, the incidence of cancer may increase [12],[13]. Nevertheless, it is possible that a particular factor could affect the risk of colon cancer both by influencing the concentrations of insulin and through other mechanisms [14],[15]. In the presence of oxygen, most cells primarily metabolize glucose to pyruvate via glycolysis and then completely oxidize pyruvate to carbon dioxide through the citric acid cycle. However, tumor cells generate as much as 60% of their ATP through glycolysis, and the glycolytic rate of tumor cells is up to 200 times higher than that of normal cells, regardless of the presence or absence of oxygen [16],[17]. This phenomenon, recognized approximately seven decades ago, is known as the Warburg effect. This phenomenon is caused by the abnormal expression of many glycolytic enzymes. Several key enzymes, such as hexokinase (HK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) are known to play a crucial role in initiating and maintaining the high rates of glucose catabolism of rapidly growing tumors [18],[19]. PK has also been reported to contribute to the accumulation of intermediates of glycolysis for the following anabolic processes: the synthesis of nucleic acids, amino acids, and phospholipids [20]. PK imparts a growth advantage to tumor cells, particularly under hypoxic conditions. The main features of diabetes mellitus are hyperglycemia and the dysfunction of glucose metabolism. Due to hyperglycemia, the permeability of capillary vessels is decreased and the mitochondrial enzymes that are related to glucose metabolism were inhibited [21], therefore the carbon metabolism of oxidative phosphorylation is inhibited. In diabetic patients, normal cells with a low rate of glycolysis cannot obtain enough energy from glucose metabolism and may die. However, cells with a high rate of glycolysis can compensate the damage of enzymes in mitochondria and generate more ATP through glycolysis to maintain the rapid proliferation and transformation of normal cells to tumor cells. Several key enzymes and proteins involved in glucose metabolism in diabetic rats were investigated by Mansor et al. [22]. The activity of PDH, a highly regulated enzyme of mitochondrial glucose metabolism, and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) were significantly decreased. The PDH inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) level was increased. These results revealed the low rate of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria in diabetic rats. In the present study, diabetes was induced in Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats using STZ, followed by the induction of colorectal cancer using DMH. We sought to determine whether Type 2 diabetes mellitus was associated with the risk of colorectal cancer in rats and the possible mechanisms involved in this process.Materials and MethodsReagents STZ, DMH and methylene blue were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Commercial kits for immunostaining of PCNA were from Beijing Zhongshan Goldbridge Biotechnology Co. (Beijing, China). The assay kits for detecting the activities of hexokinase (HK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) were purchased from Nanjing JianCheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China).Animals Sixty male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (160–180 g) were purchased from the Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd (Beijing, China). All rats were housed in standard polypropylene cages (3 rats/cage) and kept in a room under standardized conditions (22±3°C, 12 h light/12 h darkness, humidity 50±10%) with free access to food pellets and tap water. Animals were allowed to acclimate for 1 week on chow and water. The rats were randomly divided into four groups of 15 animals each: (1) the Control group; (2) STZ group; (3) DMH group; and (4) STZ+DMH group. The rats in the control group and DMH group were provided with a normal pellet diet (NPD), and those in the STZ group and STZ+DMH group were provided with a high-fat diet (HFD). The composition and preparation of HFD (Table 1) were as previously described [23]. The body weight of rats was measured once a week. All studies were performed with the approval of the animal experimental ethics review committee of Shandong University School of Medicine.10.1371/journal.pone.0110455.t001Table 1The Composition of HFD.IngredientsDiet (g/kg)Powdered NPD550Lard200Saccharose200Yolk40Cholesterol10Development of diabetes model After 2 months of dietary manipulation, the rats in the STZ group and STZ+DMH group were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a low dose of STZ (35 mg/kg body wt; STZ was dissolved in 0.1 mol/L citric acid buffer, pH 4.4), while the rats in the control group and DMH group were given a vehicle citrate buffer (pH 4.4) in a volume of 1 ml/kg, i.p. Blood samples were drawn immediately before and 1 week after injection of STZ or its vehicle from the caudal vein after fasting for 24 hours.Development of colorectal cancer Two weeks after the injection of vehicle or STZ, the rats in the intervention groups were injected (i.p.) with either DMH (25 mg/kg body wt; DMH was dissolved in normal saline) or 0.9% NaCl once a week for 12 weeks. One week after the last injection of DMH, five rats from each group were sacrificed after fasting for 24 hours for ACF identification. Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture. Colon tissues were collected and divided into two parts. One part was stored in liquid nitrogen to detect the activity of enzymes, and the other part was for the observation of ACF. Twelve weeks after the last injection, the remaining rats were sacrificed for the calculation of tumor incidence, average number of tumors and tumor volume. Then, the colon tissues were harvested and divided into two parts. One part was stored in liquid nitrogen to detect the activity of enzymes, and the other part was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for pathology analysis. All of the animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation.Blood parameters Blood samples were collected and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to collect the serum, which was stored at −20°C until analysis. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were measured by the glucose oxidase method (GOD, Applygen Technologies Inc., Beijing, China). The serum concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were determined using an automated biochemical analyzer (TOSHIBA-40FR). The serum insulin (INS) concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cusabio, Wuhan Huamei Biotech Co. Ltd., Wuhan, China).Identification of ACF ACF was identified as described previously. Briefly, the colons were harvested and washed with 0.01 mol/L PBS followed by fixation in 4% neutral-buffered paraformaldehyde for 24 h. The colon tissues were stained in 0.5% methylene blue solution for 5 min, followed by one rinsing wash. The total number of ACF and the number of aberrant crypts (ACs) in each focus were counted under a light microscope (40×).Calculation of tumor incidence, number and volume Tumor incidence is the number of rats that tumors were developed in the colon tissue with the repeated injection of DMH during the whole experiment process. The rats that tumors were visualized in general by gross examination in colon tissue at the end of the experiment were indicate tumor-bearing rats. The tumor incidence, average tumor number and tumor size were calculated using the following formulas [24]:Histological assay and Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) staining Normal colon tissue, colon tumor and tissues adjacent to tumors were harvested and fixed in 4% neutral-buffered paraformaldehyde for 24 h. The tissues embedded in paraffin were cut into 4-µm sections on histology slides and stained for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and PCNA immunostaining using a streptavidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase complex method (a commercial kit) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Brown-yellow stained nuclei were considered positive. For determination of the proliferative index, five high power lens (HP) visual fields (200 cells each) consisting of a total of 1000 cells were counted. The proliferative index (PI) was expressed as the percentage of PCNA-positive nuclei among the total number of cells counted.Assay of enzyme activity The enzyme activities were measured in both the peritumoral and tumoral regions. If no tumors were found, the tissue samples were dissected at random. Frozen tissue (0.1 g) was homogenized in a glass homogenizer with 0.9 ml of normal saline. To preserve the activity of enzymes, the entire grinding process was performed on ice. The activity of hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were measured.Statistical Analyses All results were presented as the means ± S.E.M. and all P values reported are two-tailed and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. For parameters with Gaussian distribution, comparisons of body weight between each two groups and also between NPD-fed and HFD-fed rats, the ‘number of ACF’, the ‘Tumors/All rats’, ‘Tumors/Tumor bearing rats’ and ‘Volume of Tumors’ between DMH and STZ+DMH group, the enzymes activities between the peritumoral and the intratumoral and also between each two groups were all performed using unpaired student’s T test. Tumor incidence was compared using Chi square test. Data analysis was performed employing the statistical package for social science, version 18 (SPSS Software, SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).ResultsPhysical parameters The time course of the experiment is shown in Figure 1. One week after the beginning of the experiment, one rat in the control group died unexpectedly. Due to a severe weight loss, one rat in the STZ+DMH group also died 3 weeks before tumor observation.10.1371/journal.pone.0110455.g001Figure 1Time course of the experiment and the animal treatment procedures. STZ was administered as 35 mg/kg, i.p. and DMH was administered as 25 mg/kg/week, i.p. The abbreviations denote STZ: Streptozotocin; DMH: 1,2-dimethylhydrazine; ACF: Aberrant crypt foci. Figure 2 illustrates that the body weight of all rats kept increasing over the two-month protocol, and feeding of HFD resulted in a statistically significant increase in body weight compared to NPD-fed rats (413.68±2.76 vs. 370.90±4.69, P<0.05). Following the injection of STZ, the body weight of rats in the control group and STZ group kept increasing during the entire duration of the experiment, and the weight of those in the STZ group increased faster than those in the control group. However, along with the injection of DMH, the body weight of rats began to decrease and the weight of those in the STZ+DMH group decreased faster than those in DMH group. At the end of the experiment, the body weight of rats in the STZ group was increased significantly compared to the control group (581.82±4.88 vs. 515.07±2.76, P<0.05). In contrast, DMH-induced (DMH group and STZ+DMH group) weights were decreased compared to those of the control group (461.25±7.68 or 357.24±9.14 vs. 515.07±2.76, P<0.05), and the weights of rats in the STZ+DMH group were lower than those in the DMH group (357.24±9.14 vs. 461.25±7.68, P<0.05).10.1371/journal.pone.0110455.g002Figure 2Body weight of rats throughout the entire experiment.

At the conclusion of the experiment, *P<0.05 vs. Control group. #P<0.05 vs. DMH group.Serological analysis Blood biochemical indices (FBG, TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, INS) were measured immediately before and one week after the injection of vehicle or STZ (Table 2). Serum FBG levels as well as TG, LDL-C and INS were all significantly increased in HFD-fed rats compared with NPD-fed rats before the injection of STZ (P<0.05, respectively). However, there was a reduction of HDL-C (0.41±0.02 vs. 0.51±0.03, P<0.05). Injection of STZ resulted in a significant increase of FBG, TG, TC and LDL-C associated with a significant reduction of HDL-C. In addition, although the injection of STZ produced a reduction of INS level in HFD-fed rats (72.86±3.75 vs. 89.72±2.62, P<0.05), the level of INS was still considerably higher than that of in NPD-fed rats (72.86±3.75 vs. 30.90±3.28, P<0.05).10.1371/journal.pone.0110455.t002Table 2Level of blood biochemical indexs.NPD-fedHFD-fedBeforeAfterBeforeAfterFBG (mmol/L)4.43±0.074.60±0.085.34±0.11*14.53±0.29**#TG (mmol/L)0.61±0.040.59±0.041.15±0.07*6.75±0.25**#TC (mmol/L)1.17±0.041.13±0.041.40±0.044.07±0.26**#HDL-C (mmol/L)0.51±0.030.49±0.020.41±0.02*0.22±0.02**#LDL-C (mmol/L)0.77±0.070.78±0.040.95±0.06*1.41±0.07**#INS (µIU/ml)29.19±2.9130.90±3.2889.72±2.62**72.86±3.75**# Blood samples were drawn immediately before and 1 week after injection of STZ.

Unpaired student’s T test was used to detect the difference between DMH group and STZ+DMH group. As shown in Table 3, the total number of ACF in the STZ+DMH group was significantly higher than that in the DMH group (230.80±8.85 vs. 141.00±5.26, P<0.05). The number of foci containing 1 crypt, 2 crypts and ≥3 crypts were also significantly increased. In the STZ+DMH group, the number of foci containing more than 3 crypts was even higher than that of foci containing 2 crypts (74.60±3.11 vs. 45.40±1.57, P<0.05). In addition, some tissues that resemble tumor were found in the STZ+DMH group (Figure 3F).10.1371/journal.pone.0110455.g003Figure 3Formation of ACF induced by DMH in the rat colon.

Seven rats in the DMH group and eight in the STZ+DMH group were found to have tumors (Table 4). The incidence of tumors in the STZ+DMH group was higher than that in the DMH group, but the difference did not reached statistical significance (88.89% vs. 70.00%, P>0.05). The volume of tumors, total number of tumors and average number of tumors in the STZ+DMH group were significantly increased compared with that in the DMH group (P<0.05, respectively). The volume of the biggest tumor found in the STZ+DMH group reached to 665.5 mm3, but the smallest in that group was only 6 mm3. In contrast, the volume of the biggest tumor in the DMH group was only 75 mm3, and the smallest was only 4 mm3 (Figure 4). The tumors growth in the intestinal lumen interfered with bowel movements, resulting in difficult defecation and building of intestinal gas in some rats (Figure 4D).10.1371/journal.pone.0110455.g004Figure 4Tumor tissues obtained from DMH-induced rats.

As shown in Figure 5, the proliferation index (PI) in the DMH+STZ group was significantly higher than that in DMH group (84.5±6.72 vs. 52.3±5.58, P<0.05). These data indicated that the DMH treatment significantly promoted cell proliferation, which was accelerated by STZ-induced diabetes.10.1371/journal.pone.0110455.g005Figure 5A bar chart demonstrating the proliferation index (PI) of colorectal tumor cells in DMH-induced colon tissues (DMH group and STZ+DMH group).

The activities of HK, PK and PDH in colonic tissues were measured and shown in Figure 6.10.1371/journal.pone.0110455.g006Figure 6Bar charts demonstrating the enzyme activities in colon tissues. No tumor formation was detected in the Control group and STZ group, so dissect the samples at random.

The activities of hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in colonic tissues were measured. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. and analyzed using unpaired student’s T test at P<0.05.

As shown in Figure 6A, the activities of HK in the intratumoral tissues in the DMH group and STZ+DMH group were significantly increased compared with that in peritumoral tissues and the normal tissues (including the control group and STZ group, P<0.05, respectively). The activity of HK in the STZ group was also higher than that in the control group and the peritumoral tissues in the DMH group (61.26±1.57 vs. 44.61±1.48 and 48.01±1.70, P<0.05, respectively). Regardless of the intratumoral or peritumoral location, the HK activity in the STZ+DMH group was higher than that in the DMH group (P<0.05, respectively). The activities of PK (Figure 6B) in the intratumoral tissues of the colon in the DMH group and STZ+DMH group were all significantly increased compared with that in the peritumoral tissues and were also higher than the control group (P<0.05, respectively). However, no difference in the intratumoral tissues was found between DMH group and STZ+DMH group. The activity of PK in the STZ group was higher than that in the control group (111.42±4.10 vs. 82.40±4.96, P<0.05) and was higher than the peritumoral tissues in the STZ+DMH group without reaching statistical significance (P>0.05). The activity of PK in the peritumoral tissues in the STZ+DMH group was higher than the control group (102.66±4.68 vs. 82.40±4.96, P<0.05), but no difference was observed between the control group and the peritumoral tissues in the DMH group. A significant reduction of PDH activity (Figure 6C) was found in diabetic rats when compared with the control group (1.34±0.05 vs. 2.32±0.05, P<0.05). In addition, the activity of PDH in the intratumoral tissue was considerably decreased when compared with the peritumoral tissues (P<0.05, respectively). Both in the introtumoral and peritumoral tissues, the activity of PDH in the STZ+DMH group were significantly lower than the DMH group (P<0.05, respectively). Four points in time course of the experiment were selected to indicate the changes of these three enzymes activity in the STZ+DMH group (Figure 6D). No rats were sacrificed at the start point and DMH injection point, and the data at these two points were replaced by the data in control group and STZ group at the end of the experiment respectively. As shown in Figure 6D, the activities of HK and PK were all significantly increased after the type 2 diabetes were induced (62.26±2.06 vs. 44.61±1.48, 100.79±1.49 vs. 80.54±4.27, P<0.05). Whereas, there was a reduction in the activity of PDH (1.34±0.05 vs. 2.32±0.05, P<0.05). Moreover, the current results showed that repeated DMH injection resulted in a further increase in HK and PK and reduction in PDH activities (P<0.05, respectively).Discussion One of the main objectives of the present work was to determine whether type 2 diabetes mellitus could increase the risk of colorectal cancer in an animal model. The second objective was to investigate the possible mechanisms involved in this process. Therefore, the activities of HK, PK and PDH in colorectal tissues were measured to evaluate the contribution of metabolic changes in the process of tumorigenesis. Thus, our initial attempts were directed towards generating a model of type 2 diabetes that would closely reflect the natural history and metabolic characteristics of human type 2 diabetes, after which colorectal cancer was induced using DMH. The animal model of type 2 diabetes was induced using high-fat feeding in combination with a low dose of STZ (35 mg/kg). Mansor et al. have reported that this model could not only replicate the pathology of human diabetes but also mimic the disease process, but the dose of STZ must be carefully chosen [22]. Diabetic rats induced by different doses of STZ (15, 25, 35, 45 and 55 mg/kg) combined with HFD were studied by K. Srinivasan et al. [23]. The metabolic changes induced by higher doses of STZ (45 and 55 mg/kg) resembled the type 1 diabetes phenotype. In contrast, low doses of STZ (15 and 25 mg/kg) did not produce significant hyperglycemia. Hence, HFD in combination with a low dose of STZ (35 mg/kg) was the most desirable method of inducing type 2 diabetes. In our study, after 2 months of dietary manipulation, the HFD-fed rats were already mildly hyperglycemic and the body weight increased rapidly due to the consumption of a diet rich in energy in the form of saturated fats compared to NPD-fed rats. Meanwhile, the level of INS increased considerably compared to the NPD-fed groups. These data indicated that the HFD-fed rats had already raised insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia [25]. After the injection of STZ, the level of the blood biochemical indices in the HFD-fed groups were all significantly increased, except for HDL-C and INS. The reduction of INS may due to destruction of pancreatic beta cells by injection of STZ [26],[27], but the level of INS was still higher than that of the NPD-fed rats. As Srinivasan demonstrated, the elevated concentrations of glucose were relatively stable in this model, which could be used for long-term studies on diabetic complications [23]. In the present study, the DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis model was used for evaluation of the risk of cancer in diabetic rats in light of the formation of ACF and tumor incidence. Mohania D et al, successfully developed a colorectal cancer model with this agent [28]. ACF was selected as an intermediate biological evaluation index in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. ACF refer to the abnormal change of normal foci. Greaten of foci, epithelium thickening, and foci with several or multiple mutations gathered together in a focal distribution are characteristics of ACF [29]–[32]. Both in rodents or humans, in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer induced by carcinogens, ACF are precancerous lesions of colorectal cancer and are considered to be good biological markers for evaluating the effect of drugs that are used to prevent and control the formation of colorectal cancer in rats [32],[33]. Rodrigues et al. demonstrated that the DMH-induced colorectal cancer model in rats is a valid tool to investigate the association of ACF with colorectal cancer. ACF may be regarded as early morphological markers in the pathogenesis of well-differentiated tumors in colon carcinogenesis [32]. The results of this study indicated that the number of ACF and the number of foci containing different number of crypts in the STZ+DMH group increased compared with the DMH group. In the DMH group, 89.4% ACF had one or two crypts, and only 10.6% ACF had three or more crypts. However, in the STZ+DMH group, the incidence of ACF with one or two crypts was 67.7% and 32.3% had three or more crypts. In contrast, the STZ group had no ACF formation. Epidemiologic findings have shown that the incidence of colorectal cancer in diabetic patients was closely related to the diabetes duration. Thus, we inferred that a much longer time is needed for the rats in the STZ group to develop ACF. The significant increase of foci containing ≥3 crypts and the detection of tumor-like tissue in the STZ+DMH group indicated that the presence of diabetes mellitus shortened the duration of tumorigenesis. In accordance, Zaafar et al. have reported that diabetes promotes the size of cell and the inflammatory reactions in the mucosal layer like lymphoid proliferation, congestion of blood vessels and fibrosis [34]. At the end of our present study, tumors were found both in the DMH group and STZ+DMH group. The incidence, number and size of tumors in the STZ+DMH group increased compared with that of DMH group. In contrast, no tumors were found in the STZ group. Whereas, no lesions in general were visualized by gross examination in Zaafar’s study [34]. Different animals were selected in the experiments may be the possible explanation for this phenomenon. Mice were used in their experiment while rats were selected in our study. The gap of body size may reflect the size of the tumor, so tumors were difficult to be visualized in mice colon tissues. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of tumors between the STZ+DMH group and DMH group in current result. Possible explanations for this phenomenon may include the limited sample size, with only 15 rats in each group. Overall, these data demonstrated that diabetic rats have a high risk of colorectal cancer. Rapid proliferation is the main feature of tumor cells. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a DNA clamp that acts as a processivity factor for DNA polymerase δ in eukaryotic cells and is essential for replication. Bostick et al. have reported that the expression of PCNA is closely related to the proliferation of cell in colon tissue and can be used as a very reliable indicator to evaluate the proliferation dynamics of tumor cell [35]. The present study demonstrated that PCNA was highly expressed in all tumor tissues and that the expression of PCNA was increased in colonic ACF compared with that of normal intestinal glands. PCNA expression can reflect cellular proliferation activity and is used as a reliable index for evaluating the kinetics of tumor cell proliferation. Our results showed that PCNA was expressed in DMH-induced colon cancer cells, and the strongest proliferation activity was observed in the DMH+STZ group. These data indicated that STZ treatment could promote DMH-induced cell proliferation. Previous hypothesis about the possible mechanisms involved in DM-related cancer was the abnormal increase of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the serum that can lead to the occurrence of tumors by promoting the transformation and proliferation of colorectal epithelial cells, influencing the cell cycle and inhibiting cell apoptosis. As shown in Zaafar’s report [34], the level of IGF-1 and VEGF were all increased in diabetic mice and diabetic mice had higher susceptibility to DMH-induced colon cancer compared to nondiabetics. In current study, the hypothesis about the possible mechanisms involved in DM-related cancer was focused on the changes of glycolytic enzymes’ activity. Recent studies have shown that several molecules involved in the Warburg effect may be rational targets for cancer therapy [16],[17]. All functions in cells are energy-dependent. The oxidation of glucose through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation can produce 30–32 molecules of net ATP per molecule of glucose, but glycolysis generates only two molecules of ATP. HK and PK are key enzymes in glycolysis. Tumor cells exhibit a high rate of glycolysis under aerobic conditions, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. It had been reported that insulin could induce HK gene transcription, and this, in turn, increased glucose phosphorylation in these cells [36]. A study by Mansor showed that the activity of PDH, a highly regulated enzyme of mitochondrial glucose metabolism, was significantly decreased in the diabetic model [22]. PDH is also negatively regulated by PDK via phosphorylation, and the level of PDK has been shown to be significantly increased in diabetic models [22],[37]. The phosphorylation of PDH can prevent the movement of pyruvate into the mitochondrial matrix [37],[38]. The results of current study showed that the activities of HK and PK significantly increased in diabetic rats, whereas the activity of PDH was reduced. In addition, the activities of PK and HK in tumoral tissues were significant higher than that in peritumoral tissues. The imbalance of carbohydrate metabolism between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation could result in the generation of lactic acid and hydrogen ions. The acidic microenvironment provides a proliferative advantage for tumorigenesis. In addition, many intermediate products in glycolysis can be exploited by tumor cells to synthesize proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, thereby providing the necessary materials for the growth and proliferation of tumor cells [39]. These data indicated that the increasing activity of glycolytic enzymes in diabetes might play a role in the occurrence of colorectal cancer. However, the detailed mechanism needs further investigation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that type 2 diabetes mellitus is a high risk factor for colorectal carcinogenesis. The mechanism for this risk may involve the dysregulation of glucose metabolism in diabetes. Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in diabetic mellitus might impact the activity of enzymes catalyzing the biochemical reactions of carbohydrate metabolism. The high rate of glycolysis in colon tissues provided a proliferative advantage for tumorigenesis. This study indicated several rational targets for the prevention of diabetic complications and tumor therapy.

Here, we focused on the role of reactive mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in osteosarcoma (OS), and used human adipose MSC and a panel of OS cell lines (Saos-2, HOS, and 143B) to investigate the mutual effect of normal-cancer cell metabolic programming. Our results showed that MSC are driven by oxidative stress induced by OS cells to undergo Warburg metabolism, with increased lactate production. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of lactate monocarboxylate transporters. By real time PCR and immunofluorescence, in MSC we detected the expression of MCT-4, the transporter for lactate efflux, whereas MCT-1, responsible for lactate uptake, was expressed in OS cells. In agreement, silencing of MCT-1 by siRNA significantly affected the ATP production in OS cancer cells. Thus, cancer cells directly increase their mitochondrial biogenesis using this energy-rich metabolite that is abundantly provided by MSC as an effect of the altered microenvironmental conditions induced by OS cells. We also showed that lactate produced by MSC promotes the migratory ability of OS cells. These data provide novel information to be exploited for cancer therapies targeting the mutual metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells and their stroma.

These data provide novel information to be exploited for cancer therapies targeting the mutual metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells and their stroma. INTRODUCTION In addition to cancer cells, a number of reactive elements are present in the tumor microenvironment, including endothelial cells, immune cells, and fibroblast-like stromal cells, playing a key role in the establishment and progression of the tumor [1]. In particular, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) [2, 3], that are thought to originate from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) [4, 5], have been described as key players in tumor metabolism. According to Otto Warburg's findings, a hallmark of cancer cells is anaerobic glycolysis even under aerobic conditions. This behavior involves increased glucose consumption with consequent excessive production of lactate and H+, which causes a decrease of the extracellular pH to levels lower than in normal cells [6]. Indeed, most normal cells have a low rate of glycolysis followed by oxidation of pyruvate in mitochondria. The Warburg effect has important medical applications as high aerobic glycolysis has been clinically confirmed in most of malignancies. Recent studies have shown that the Warburg effect is also activated in CAF that secrete energy-rich glycolytic metabolites, such as lactate and ketones. Cancer cells are able to uptake these metabolites and use them in the mitochondrial TCA cycle (the so-called reverse Warburg effect). Thus, there is a higher production of energy that therefore drives a large number of the cell's energy-requiring processes. This role of CAF as tumor feeders has been reported in human breast [7, 8], prostate [9], and head and neck cancer [10]. CAF have also been established as an important component of osteosarcoma (OS) [11, 12], a highly malignant tumor of bone that typically affects children and adolescents. OS rapidly invades and destroys the surrounding bone and soft tissues, and in over 90% of the cases spreads to the lung within a few months after diagnosis. Radical surgical removal of the primary followed by aggressive multi-agent chemotherapy has been developed as the treatment of choice of OS, with a significant improvement in survival [13], although less toxic, more active agents are strongly felt to be needed. In this respect, most studies have focused on the molecular features of OS cells. In this study, we considered the tumor microenvironment of OS as a whole and set out to inquire into the metabolic interactions between the stroma and tumor compartments. We employed OS cell lines such as Saos-2, HOS, and 143B. Our hypothesis is that the cellular metabolism of OS is deeply altered by MSC, affecting their behavior not only in the primary tumor site but also at the metastatic niche. Although the origin of OS is largely unknown, three specific aspects suggest the importance of MSC in the pathogenesis of this tumor. First, this tumor likely arises from transformed stem cells of mesenchymal origin [14]. Secondly, the number of circulating MSC is extremely high in OS patients [15]. The third consideration is that OS are able to recruit these circulating MSC [16]. Interestingly, MSC have been demonstrated to provide a fertile microenvironment for OS cells, promoting tumor progression and the formation of metastasis also through the secretion of signaling molecules [12, 17, 18]. We investigated the interaction between MSC and OS cells and, for the first time, were able to demonstrate the induction of aerobic glycolysis in MSC as a consequence of oxidative stress induced by OS cells. In turn, MSC enhance lactate secretion through an increased expression of MCT-4, and OS cells upload lactate through MCT-1, eventually raising their mitochondrial respiration to facilitate migration.RESULTSReciprocal metabolic reprogramming of OS cells and MSC To investigate the bioenergetic status of OS microenvironment, we employed a co-culture system of human OS cells (Saos-2) and human MSC from adipose tissue, and evaluated the mitochondrial activity as compared to homotypic cultures. To this end, Saos-2-MSC co-cultures and corresponding homotypic cultures were first immunostained with MitoTracker, a dye that detects functional mitochondria with active membrane potential. Figure 1A shows that homotypic culture of MSC displays a high mitochondrial activity that is decreased in the co-culture condition, suggesting that the presence of Saos-2 cells induces a mitochondrial dysfunction in MSC.Figure 1MSC-Saos-2 cell co-cultures exhibit changes in the mitochondrial state (A) MSC decrease their mitochondrial activity in co-cultured Saos-2 cells. Co-cultures of Saos-2 GFP (+) positive cells (green) and MSC were immunostained with MitoTracker (red). Note that co-culture with OS cancer cells induces a significant decrease in the mitochondrial activity of MSC (lower row), as compared to MSC cultured alone (top row). Importantly, images were acquired using identical exposure settings. White asterisks indicated Saos-2 GFP (+) positive cells. Original magnification, 20x; scale bar 10 μm. (B) MSC induce an increase in mitochondrial mass in co-cultured Saos-2 GFP (+) positive cells (green). Homotypic cultures of Saos-2-GFP (first row, merge first panel) and their co-culture with MSC (lower row, merge first panel) were immunostained with an anti-intact mitochondrial membrane antibody (red). DAPI was used to stain nuclei (blue). Note that in co-culture, the mitochondrial mass is clearly increased in Saos-2 cells as compared to the respective homotypic culture. Importantly, images were acquired using identical exposure settings. Original magnification, 20x. Scale bar 20 μm. We next performed immunostaining of OS-MSC co-cultures with an antibody for the intact mitochondrial membrane (MAB1273), to evaluate the mitochondrial mass. Figure 1B shows that MSC increase mitochondrial mass in adjacent Saos-2 GFP (+) cells. These results indicate that, in the co-culture system mimicking tumor microenvironment, MSC induce mitochondrial activity and biogenesis in OS cells. This increased mitochondrial power may sustain their increased metabolic demands. On the other hand, OS cells decrease mitochondrial power of MSC, inducing their metabolic switch toward an aerobic glycolytic pathway.Saos-2 cells induce aerobic glycolysis in MSC Next, we set out to investigate the glycolytic profile of MSC. To this end, we studied the expression of pyruvate kinase isoform 2 (PKM2), a key regulator of glycolysis and promoter of tumor growth [19]. For this purpose, MSC were incubated with conditioned medium (CM) derived from Saos-2 cells for 24 hours. Western blot analysis demonstrates that MSC activated by Saos-2-CM have a higher PKM2 expression, as compared to untreated MSC (Figure 2A), suggesting that the conditioned medium from Saos-2 cells induces a glycolytic switch in MSC. A shift towards a glycolytic phenotype is also supported by the real time PCR analysis for the glucose transporter GLUT1 mRNA in CM-activated MSC versus not activated MSC. Figure 2B (left plot) shows increased GLUT1 expression in MSC after activation with Saos-2-CM, suggesting an enhanced glucose uptake and increased glycolysis.Figure 2Saos-2 cells drive aerobic glycolysis in adjacent MSC (A) Upregulation of PKM2 in MSC activated by OS cells. Cell lysates were prepared from MSC activated by conditioned medium from serum-starved Saos-2 cells or untreated, non-activated MSC. Lysates were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-PKM2 specific antibody. Note the upregulation of PKM2 in tumor-activated MSC, as compared to untreated MSC. Normalization was done by actin immunoblot. (B) Gene expression analysis of GLUT1 (left plot) and MCT-4 (right plot) by RT-PCR. Note that MSC cultured with CM from Saos-2 cells, show significantly higher levels of the GLUT1 and MCT-4 genes, versus non-activated MSC. Glut1, p=0.0092; MCT-4, p=0.0071. (C) Upregulation of MCT-4 expression was validated by immunofluorescence analysis. Homotypic cultures of MSC (top row) and Saos-2 GFP cells (middle row) and Saos-2-MSC heterotypic cultures (lower row) were immunostained with MCT-4 antibodies. DAPI was used to stain nuclei (blue). Note that the MCT-4 expression (red) is clearly increased in MSC in co-culture condition, as compared to MSC cultured alone. Importantly, images were acquired using identical exposure settings. Original magnification, 20x. Scale bar 40 μm. (D) Tumor-activated MSC show increased lactate secretion. MSC were incubated with CM obtained from OS cells (Saos-2 or HOS) for 48 hours. Then, cells were carefully washed and incubated in fresh serum-free medium for an additional 24 hours. Lactate assay was performed on this culture medium. Note that lactate production is significantly increased in MSC, after activation with conditioned media from Saos-2 cells (left plot) and HOS cells (right plot). Values were normalized by cell numbers *p<0.05. Next, we investigated the expression of MCT-4, the passive lactate-proton shuttle responsible for the lactate efflux. We found that the CM-treatment increased the gene expression of MCT-4 (Figure 2B, right plot). In agreement with these data, immunofluorescence analysis demonstrates that MSC in co-culture with OS cells show higher MCT-4 expression, as compared to the corresponding homotypic culture (Figure 2C). Given that MSC undergo a glycolytic switch following their activation by OS cells, we next investigated the secretion of lactate, the final product of glycolysis. Importantly, we observed that MSC, after activation with CM from 2 OS cell lines (Saos-2 and HOS cells), show an increased secretion of lactate, with respect to untreated MSC (Figure 2D).OS cells uptake lactate produced by activated MSC We next investigated the expression of MCT-1, the monocarboxylate transporter for the uptake of lactate, in OS cells, by real time PCR. Saos-2 cells, after incubation with CM of activated MSC, significantly increased the expression of MCT-1, as compared to untreated cells (Figure 3A).Figure 3Tumor-activated MSC induce high MCT-1 expression in Saos-2 cells (A) The result is observed by RT-PCR, *p<0.05. (B) MCT-1 is upregulated in Saos-2-GFP cells co-cultured with MSC. MCT-1 immunofluorescence was performed in homotypic cultures of MSC (top row) and Saos-2 cells (middle row), and in the MSC-Saos-2 cell co-culture system (lower row). Note that MCT-1 expression (red staining) is mainly present in the OS green cells. Merged image is shown in the middle and lower panels. DAPI was used to stain nuclei (blue). Importantly, images were acquired using identical exposure settings. Original magnification, 20x. Scale bar 40 μm. (C) MCT-4 immunohistochemistry was performed on mouse tumor xenograft of human 143B cells. Note that tumor stroma from the host is strongly stained for MCT-4 (brown), while the tumor compartment is poorly stained. Original magnification 20x; scale bar 50 μm (upper row). Original magnification 60x and scale bar 20 μm (lower row). These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence, showing MCT-1 upregulation in OS cells co-cultured with MSC, as compared to OS cells cultured alone (Figure 3B). These results suggest that OS cells are able to uptake lactate, a high-energy metabolite which is a substrate for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. To assess if the metabolic reprogramming observed in vitro also occurs in vivo, 143B human OS cells were injected into the flanks of SCID mice. After three weeks, tumors were collected and immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections for the expression of MCT-4, the transporter for lactate extrusion. As shown in Figure 3C, MCT-4 was highly expressed in the stromal compartment of the xenograft tumors. These findings indicate that, also in vivo, glycolysis preferentially occurs in the stromal compartment, leading to increased MCT-4 expression. This suggests that stromal cells avoid the internal accumulation of lactate, making it available for OS cells. Thus, our data indicate that tumor cells induce important metabolic alterations in adjacent stromal cells, with impairment of their mitochondrial function and enhancement of aerobic glycolysis.Aerobic glycolysis in MSC is ROS-dependent Oxidative stress is known to drive tumor spread and invasion [20, 21] and this phenomenon has already been shown in stromal fibroblasts from breast and prostate cancer and suggested as a starter of glycolytic switch [9, 22]. Figure 4A (representative plot) shows that over 70% of MSC cells exposed to OS-conditioned medium have higher levels of ROS, with respect to non-activated MSC. Interestingly, the basal ROS levels of MSC were restored when cells were treated with the antioxidant N-Acetyl-Cystein (NAC) (Figure 4A, graph bar). Accordingly, the expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 was also decreased in the presence of NAC (Figure 4B). These findings indicate that MSC undergo aerobic glycolysis as a consequence of a ROS-dependent interplay with OS cancer cells.Figure 4Oxidative stress is increased in activated MSC cells (A) MSC cells were exposed to conditioned medium from OS cells and evaluated by flow cytometry using DCFH-DA (as a measure of total ROS released). The representative plot of the flow-cytometric analysis shows that about 70% of MSC exposed to the Saos-2 cells-conditioned medium (continuous dark line) exhibit a fluorescence intensity higher than that observed in untreated MSC (dashed light line). The histogram bars show the ratio between “MC of activated MSCs” and “MC of non-activated MSC” (mean ± SEM). The ROS production in MSC challenged with the conditioned medium of Saos-2 cells was significantly increased in comparison to untreated MSC, but the basal activity of MSC is restored when an antioxidant, i.e. NAC, is introduced into the culture system. **p= 0.002; ***p= 0.0005. MC: mean channel of fluorescence intensity. (B) Pre-treatment of MSC with the anti-oxidant NAC decreases the expression of GLUT-1, suggesting that the shift to the Warburg metabolism with increased uptake of glucose depends on oxidative stress, *p<0.05.Lactate promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation in Saos-2 cells Next, we evaluated if lactate is sufficient per se to induce the effects observed in the co-culture system, i.e. the promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis. To this end, we treated homotypic cultures of Saos-2 cells with 10 mM lactate for 48 hours. After treatment, cells were fixed and immunostained with an antibody against the intact mitochondrial membrane (MAB1273). As shown in Figure 5A, lactate administration strongly increases the mitochondrial mass of OS cells. In addition, we performed Western blot analysis with a panel of antibodies against OXPHOS complex subunits. These subunits must be properly assembled to allow a functional oxidative phosphorylation. As shown in Figures 5B and 5C, upon lactate treatment, OS cells show a strong increased expression of complexes I, II, IV, and V.Figure 5Lactate treatment promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation in OS cells (A) Homotypic cultures of Saos-2 cells were treated with or without 10 mM of lactate for 48 hours. Cells were fixed and immunostained with an antibody against the mitochondrial membrane (red). Note that lactate treatment increases mitochondrial mass in Saos-2 cells, mimicking the co-culture condition. Importantly, images were acquired using the same exposure settings. Original magnification, 20x; scale bar 50 μm. (B) Immunoblot analysis of V-ATP5A, III-UQCRC2, II-SDHB, IV-COXII and I-NDUFB8 was performed on Saos-2 cells with or without 10 mM of lactate for 48 hours. Actin immunoblot was used for normalization. (C) The plot reports the densitometric quantitation (ratio of each protein:actin). Note that complex I, complex II, complex IV and V are upregulated in Saos-2 cells after treatment with lactate, as compared to the untreated samples. *p<0.05. (D) Saos-2 cells were treated with MCT-1 specific siRNA and, after 24 hours, the MCT-1 mRNA expression levels were evaluated. The silencing significantly inhibited MCT-1 expression, *p<0.05 vs not treated cells. (E) Homotypic cultures of Saos-2 cells transfected with MCT-1 siRNA, with not-targeting siRNA, or untreated, were incubated with or without 10 mM of lactate for 48 hours. Then, ATP content was evaluated. The silencing of MCT-1 expression impaired the increase in ATP content induced by lactate treatment (*p<0.05 treated with lactate vs untreated). Finally, we evaluated if the uptake of lactate that is used by Saos-2 cells for mitochondrial biogenesis, is mediated by MCT-1. For this purpose, we silenced MCT-1 expression in Saos-2 cells by a specific siRNA. Once we confirmed the significant inhibition of MCT-1 mRNA after transfection (Figure 5D), we observed that MCT-1 silencing strongly affected the ATP content of Saos-2 cells treated with lactate. Figure 5E shows that Saos-2 cells treated with an unspecific siRNA or untreated display a significant increase in ATP content after incubation with lactate. Conversely, no significant increase was observed in Saos-2 cells treated with MCT-1 specific siRNA (Figure 5E). These results suggest that OS cells are able to uptake lactate through MCT-1 and utilize this metabolite for their Krebs cycle and ATP synthesis, therefore increasing their bioenergetic status.Lactate increases the migratory ability of OS cells We then examined the effects of activated MSC on the migratory ability of Saos-2 and HOS cells. For this purpose, MSC were activated by treatment with OS cell-derived conditioned media. Then, to prepare conditioned media from activated MSC, MSC were rinsed and incubated for 24 hours in serum-free media. OS cells were treated with conditioned medium from MSC previously activated, and their migratory ability was assessed using a modified Boyden chamber. We observed that CM from activated MSC significantly enhances cancer cells migration relative to non-activated cells (Figure 6A). Next, we performed an in vitro scratch assay (Figure 6B, representative image) of Saos-2 and HOS cells treated with lactate 10 mM for 24 hours. Lactate treatment significantly increased the migration of OS cells with respect to untreated cells (Figure 6C). These data indicate that MSC are able to promote the migration of OS cells, and this effect is mimicked by lactate treatment (Figure 6D).Figure 6MSC-activated Saos-2 and HOS cells acquire increased migratory capacity (A) We assessed whether tumor-activated MSC were able to increase the migration of Saos-2 and HOS cells, using a modified Boyden chamber assay. As a control, serum-free CM from non-activated MSC was placed in the lower chambers. Note that CM of previously activated MSC was able to increase the migratory capacity of OS cells, *p<0.05. (B and C) We analyzed Saos-2 and HOS migration by an in vitro scratch assay. OS cells were plated to create a confluent monolayer, which was later scraped. Images were acquired with a phase-contrast microscope. To capture the same field during the image acquisition, marks next to the scratch were used as reference points. (B) Saos-2 cells were treated with or without 10 mM lactate, as indicated. Images were acquired at 0 and 24 hours. Note that Saos-2 treated with lactate migrate faster, as compared to untreated Saos-2 cells. Original magnification, 10x. (C) Quantification of cell migration after scratch assay of Saos-2 cells (left plot) and of HOS cells calculated as % closure (right plot). (D) Proposed model of the metabolic circuit between MSC and OS cells. The left drawing represents the primary tumor or the metastatic site that includes tumor cells and MSC as stromal compartment. The right drawing explains in detail the reciprocal metabolic reprogramming: tumor cells induce MSC to undergo Warburg metabolism leading to increased uptake of glucose and its conversion to lactate. Stromal cells extrude lactate through the shuttle MCT-4. OS cells are able to uptake this metabolite through the MCT-1 transporter, and utilizing it as fuel for their TCA cycle, as well as for cell migration.DISCUSSION The tumor microenvironment is a cellular matrix consisting of cells, soluble factors, signaling molecules and extracellular matrix that supports tumor growth and invasion, protects the tumors from host immunity, fosters therapeutic resistance, and provides a niche for dormant metastases to thrive. As our understanding of the role of the tumor microenvironment in cancer continues to evolve, the complexity of the interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment has become increasingly apparent. Tumor microenvironment is a dynamic milieu: non-immune mesenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts and their precursors MSC, play an important role in tumor microenvironment where they are “educated” by neoplastic cells and, vice versa, influence the behavior of cancer elements. Controversial results have been reported when MSC injected into mice resulted either in promotion [23, 24, 25] or inhibition [26, 27] of tumor growth. Regarding OS, it has been reported that MSC exert a pro-inflammatory effect on cancer cells by producing soluble factors that promote cell proliferation [4, 28]. However, the effect of MSC within tumors seems unpredictable and dependent on microenvironment signals [29]. In this study, we considered two metabolic compartments in OS, cancer cells and reactive MSC. Our results suggest a model of metabolic coupling by which MSC, after having been “activated” by the OS cells, increase the aggressive behavior of cancer cells. In particular, we showed that tumor cells induce oxidative stress, via ROS production, in adjacent MSC, triggering a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis. Moreover, we also showed that MSC in contact with OS cells undergo activation and produce lactate, as described in the Warburg effect. On the other hand, cancer cells increase their mitochondrial activity and their mitochondrial mass by utilizing lactate by an increased MCT-1 expression. This pathological process involving MCT-1 mimics the physiological metabolic situation observed in skeletal muscle fibers, previously described [30]. Our data indicate that the inhibition of MCT-1 significantly affects the energy metabolism of cancer cells, by decreasing ATP production. In agreement, the importance of MCT-1 in OS has been investigated in a recent study, showing that downregulation of MCT-1 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, and enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy [31]. Moreover, we also found in vivo evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in the stromal compartment of OS mouse tumor xenografts. Indeed, the immunohistochemistry analysis performed on murine tumor sections revealed that MCT-4 was detected only in the stromal host-derived cells. These results suggest not only that OS cells are able to recruit reactive stromal elements, but also that these cells can be induced to undergo aerobic glycolysis and fuel the tumor metabolic needs, in line with results previously observed in breast and head and neck cancer [10, 32]. In addition, we further demonstrated that activated-MSC induce tumor migration and that lactate is directly responsible for such increased migratory capacity of cancer cells. A previous study had shown that MSC drive proliferation and metastasis in OS through IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway [18]. It remains to be determined if the STAT3 pathway plays a role in our model. Here, for the first time, we have addressed the role of MSC as modulators of OS metabolism and behavior (Figure 6D). In fact, we demonstrated that MSC play a role as tumor cells feeders after their metabolic reprogramming to a glycolytic phenotype (reverse Warburg phenotype), while, at the same time, tumor cells undergo mitochondrial biogenesis and increased mitochondrial activity. The importance of the increased mitochondrial mass and bioenergetics in tumorigenesis has been also confirmed by recent findings regarding the mitochondrial citrate transporter CIC/ SLC25A1 [45, 46]. CIC is necessary for the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Interestingly, the authors demonstrated that the genetic CIC inhibition induced the Warburg effect in cancer cells, and inhibited tumor growth. Several studies have shown the importance of resident mesenchymal reactive cells in supporting tumor progression and metastasis in prostate, breast [33], ovarian and colon cancer [34, 35]. It has been recently shown in an animal model that the administration of exogenous MSC may promote tumor engraftment and lung colonization, leading to OS growth and metastasis [12]. These findings, together with the evidence of an increased number of circulating MSC observed in OS patients, and the interesting observation that MSC are capable to facilitate cancer migration through heterotypic interactions with tumor cells [36, 37] [12], suggest that MSC may be important for metastases development, by providing a supportive niche in certain organs. Additionally, the emerging cancer stem cell hypothesis has complicated the scenario. Indeed, it has been reported the presence of stem-like cells, implicated in tumorigenesis, metastasis and drug resistance [38, 39]. Speculatively, MSC may also exist in the cancer stem cell niche, perhaps playing a key role in the subsistence of the microenvironment. Here, we propose a cellular model applicable to the primary tumor site and to the metastatic environment. Although these data clarify some aspects of the interplay between MSC and tumor cells in aerobic condition, at the same time they bring intricacy to the system. As solid tumors have more hypoxic and acidic microenvironments than normal tissue [40], further investigations should be extended to MSC metabolic behaviors under hypoxic condition and at different pH conditions. In conclusion, given that osteosarcomas are rare tumors with poor prognosis because of metastatic dissemination, it is of vital importance to understand the interactions between MSC and their niche to possibly find therapeutic strategies.METHODSCell cultures and stable transfection Human mesenchymal stem cells were purchased from ATCC (ATCC® PCS-500-011™) and characterized as described [41, 42]. The OS cell lines Saos-2 (ATCC® HTB-85™) and HOS (ATCC® CRL-1543™) were from ATCC, and the cell line 143B was a kind gift from Dr. Michiel Pegtel (VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, NL). All cells were maintained in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin 100 units/ml-streptomycin 100 μg/ml. For co-culture experiments, MSC and Saos-2 were plated on glass cover slips in 12-wells plates in 1 ml of complete medium. OS cells were plated within 2 hours of MSC plating. Experiments were performed at a 3:1 MSC-to-OS cell ratio. As controls, monocultures of MSC and OS cells were seeded using the same number of cells as the corresponding co-cultures. The day after plating, medium was changed to RPMI with 10% NuSerum (BD Biosciences) a low protein alternative to FBS, and Pen-Strep. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To obtain activated MSC, cells were grown to 80% confluence and treated for 24 hours with conditioned medium from Saos-2 cells in serum-free medium for 48 hours. Activated Saos-2 cells were obtained by incubating them for 24 hours with conditioned medium of MSC previously activated by tumor cells. Saos-2 cells were used to generate a cell line overexpressing the GFP tag. A plasmid purchased from Addgene was employed, and cells were transfected with Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected OS cells were selected with G418/Geneticin (Life Technologies).Mitochondrial staining To evaluate the mitochondrial activity, cells were stained with MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos (M7510) (Invitrogen). Lyophilized MitoTracker was dissolved in DMSO to generate a 1 mM stock solution that was diluted into serum-free DMEM at a final concentration of 25 nM. Briefly, cells were cultured for 48 hours and then stained with MitoTracker for 5 minutes at 37°C. Cells were washed in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes.Immunocytochemistry Briefly, after 15 minutes fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were permeabilized for 10 minutes with PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 0.1% TritonX-100. Then, cells were incubated for 10 minutes with NH4Cl in PBS to quench free aldehyde groups. Primary antibody was incubated overnight. After washing, cells were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour. Finally, slides were washed, incubated with the nuclear stain and mounted. Antibodies were as follow: antibody for the surface of intact mitochondria (1:300; MAB1273, Millipore); MCT-4 (1:100; Santa Cruz); secondary antibody for immunofluorescence was Alexa orange-red 546 nm (1:500; Invitrogen).Western blotting Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (RIPA buffer) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and centrifuged at 13,000x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to remove insoluble debris. Protein concentrations were analyzed using Bradford assay (Biorad). 30 μg of proteins were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane (Fisher Scientific). After blocking for 1 hour in TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween-20) with 5% non-fat dry milk, membranes were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 hour or overnight, washed and incubated for 1 hour with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The membranes were washed and incubated with an enhanced chemi-luminescence substrate (ECL; Thermo Scientific). The antibodies were as follow: β-actin (1:5000; Sigma); PKM2 (1:200; Cell Signaling); OXPHOS (1:500; MitoSciences).Gene expression analysis Gene expression was analyzed after 24 hours of culture by quantifying gene transcripts. RNA was extracted with NucleoSpin RNA II (Macherey-nagel, Düren, Germany) and the retrotranscription was performed with MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Ca, USA). Real-Time Polymerization Chain Reaction (Real-time PCR) was performed by amplifying 1 μg of cDNA using the Light Cycler instrument and the Universal Probe Library system (Roche Applied Science, Monza, Italy). Probes and primers were selected using the web-based assay design software (ProbeFinder: http://www.roche-applied-science.com). The protocol of amplification was: 95°C for 10 minutes; 95°C for 10 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 second for 45 cycles; 40°C for 30 seconds. β-actin was used as housekeeping gene to normalize the expression of the genes of interest [43]. The results were expressed as a ratio between gene of interest and β-actin gene. All experiments were performed in triplicates.Measurement of reactive oxygen species 5-(and 6-) carboxy-2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA; C369) was from Invitrogen. CM-H2DCFDA is a cell-permeable molecule used to measure intracellular ROS. MSC were incubated with 10 μM CM-H2DCFDA for 5 minutes at 37°C, then washed with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. To control for staining specificity, cells were also treated with 10 mM of NAC overnight prior to CM-H2DCFDA incubation. The production of ROS by MSC challenged with the conditioned medium of OS cell line Saos-2 was evaluated by measuring fluorescence emission following the conversion of 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescin-diacetate (DCFH-DA) into DCF by ROS produced intracellularly. All samples were analyzed on a flow cytometer EPICS XL-MCL (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). The acquisition gate was established based on forward and side scatter parameters, and each sample was run until 10,000 events were acquired in the gate analysis. The fluorescent signal generated by ROS production was recorded as mean channel of fluorescence intensity (MC), and the effect of the conditioned media was expressed as a ratio between “MC of activated MSC” and “MC of non-activated MSC”.L-lactate assay Lactate was measured in the culture media with lactate assay kit (EnzyChrome, BioAssay Systems) according to the manifacturer's instruction.Animal studies Animals were housed and maintained in a pathogen-free environment/barrier facility at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy. 1×106 of 143B human cells were subcutaneously injected with reduced growth factor matrigel (BD Biosciences) in five-week-old severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-bg/bg male mice (Charles River Laboratories International). Mice were sacrificed after three weeks, and tumor samples were collected for histological analysis. The Animal Ethics Committee of Modena approved all the experimental protocols.Immunohistochemistry Five-micron paraffin sections were stained with MCT-4 antibody. Sections were dewaxed, rehydrated through graded ethanol series, and antigen retrieval was performed with 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0 for 15 minutes using a microwave. The cooled sections were blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide and next incubated with 5% BSA for 1 hour, followed by primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Biotinylated secondary antibodies followed by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugated were from Dako. Immunoreactivity was revealed with the DAB solution (Dako). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.ATP assay Specific gene silencing was obtained by siRNA technology associated with electromicroporation technology. Cells were trypsinized at semi-confluence and counted. 100 microliters of cell suspension containing 2×106 cells and 4 nmol of specific or control siRNA (Dharmacon) were transferred into a 1-mm cuvette, and an electrical field was applied to induce siRNA cellular internalization (MicroPorator MP-100; Digital BioTechnology). For the RNA isolation, after electroporation, Saos-2 cells were transferred into 2 mL of complete growth medium and seeded in 12-well plates (3×105 cells per well). After 24 hours, cells were lysed and RNA was extracted as described above. For ATP assay, after electroporation, Saos-2 cells were transferred into 3 mL of complete growth medium and seeded in 6-well plates (8×105 cells per well). For the analysis of ATP content, cells were lysed by using boiling ATP lysis buffer [0.1 M Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris base) (Sigma) and 2 mM EDTA adjusted to pH 7.75 with acetic acid (Sigma) and 2.5% Dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (Sigma)]. The ATP content was measured with the ATP determination kit (Molecular Probes). The luciferase signal was normalized with the Log of the total protein concentration measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). All experiments were performed in triplicates.Migration assay Transwells with uncoated permeable support and 8 μm pores were used. 4×104 viable Saos-2 cells were seeded per well and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 12 hours. All functional experiments were performed in triplicates.In vitro scratch assay Cells were plated onto the 60-mm dish to create a confluent monolayer. Cell monolayers were scraped in a straight line to create a ‘‘scratch’’ with a p200 pipet tip. Dishes were placed in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C for 24 hours. The images acquired for each sample were photographed under a phase-contrast microscope. To obtain the same field during the image acquisition, markings were created as reference points close to the scratch. The rate of migration was measured by quantifying the number of cells that moved from the edge toward the center of the scratch. Image J software was used to measure the wound closure [44].Statistical analysis Quantitative results were expressed as arithmetic mean plus or minus the standard error of the mean (SEM) from at least 3 independent experiments. Mann-Whitney test was performed as unpaired comparison for two independent variables. All p values <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. t-test was also applied when appropriate. The statistical analysis was performed by StatView5.01 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The changes in ROS production after exposure to conditioned media were evaluated by a nonparametric test for paired data (Wilcoxon signed rank test).

Some of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the success of these cultivation strategies are described. Overall this review emphasizes the need of researchers to first understand the factors that are hindering cultivation to identify the best strategies to improve cultivation efficiency. Introduction Microorganisms have two basic physiological states, alive and dead (Fig. 1). Living cells in their natural habitat can be actively growing or not growing, typically fluctuating between these two states through inactivation and resuscitation. To gain a better understanding of microorganisms, microbiologists have been cultivating them in the laboratory but have been hampered by the large number of cells that are not readily cultivated (97). The phenomenon of “uncultivable” cells from environmental samples was first observed because of the large discrepancy between cultivable numbers obtained by cultivation (culturing) of cells on agar plates (colony forming units, CFU) versus direct microscopic counts (120). These uncultivable cells fall into two broad categories, (i) bacterial groups with no cultivated representatives (hereafter called yet-to-be-cultivated cells), and (ii) bacteria belonging to groups that have been previously cultivated in the laboratory but whose cells are in a state in which they are alive but no longer replicating (hereafter called non-dividing cells) (1) (Fig. 2). Several bacterial community studies have estimated the percentages of uncultivable cells in various environments (Table 1). In general, the lowest percentages of cultivable cells were obtained from low nutrient environments (e.g., deserts) and the highest from nutrient-rich environments (e.g., fecal samples). In the field of microbial ecology, the importance of yet-to-be cultivated cells to microbial diversity has been well recognized over the past few decades with the development and application of cultivation-independent methods (1, 46). In contrast, the fraction of cells that are uncultivable from environmental samples because they are in a non-dividing state and not readily resuscitated by cultivation has not been extensively studied by microbial ecologists (119, 144). This group of uncultivable cells requires more attention as a means to increase cultivation efficiency from environmental samples. This review covers the basic differences and similarities between these two groups of uncultivable cells and the strategies that have been developed to cultivate them including media, environmental and physiochemical conditions, and the potential contributions of growth promoting compounds from symbiotic interactions. Cultivation of Archaea was not included in this review because of the limited information available on archaeal cell dormancy and strategies for their cultivation. The last section covers some of the underlying mechanisms potentially used or required by cells to initiate growth when various cultivation strategies are used.Yet-to-be-cultivated Bacteria Cells in this category are called uncultivable but in fact they are likely cultivable but currently their appropriate cultivation conditions have not been elucidated (49); therefore these types of uncultivable cells are often called yet-to-be-cultivated cells (126). Although they are not readily cultivated in the laboratory they represent an important group in nature that contributes to microbial diversity and ecosystems (46). Some examples of bacteria included in this category are several subdivisions of Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria (105). Strides are being made to cultivate yet-to-be-cultivated cells as indicated by an increase from 13 out of 40 bacterial phyla with cultivated representatives in 1998 (46) to 26 of 52 phyla in 2003 (105). The effort to obtain more cultivated representatives has been made because of the recognition of the important functional role played by these microbes in nature that is still inadequately understood. Cultivation priorities have been made in phyla that are common in some ecosystems but have previously lacked cultivated representatives. For example, the SAR11 clade within alpha Proteobacteria, which is abundant in marine waters (20), and Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria in soil (47) and water (75), and OP10 (124) now have cultivated representatives. By obtaining pure cultures or simple mixed cultures (e.g., syntrophic populations), investigators are able to obtain a deeper understanding of the specific genes related to expressed phenotypes by community members under different biological, chemical and physical conditions (55, 68).Cultivation strategies used to grow yet-to-be-cultivated bacteria Researchers have tried to improve cultivation methods to recover yet-to-be cultivated cells from the environment by providing conditions more reflective of their original habitat. Habitats are influenced by biological, chemical and physical factors and therefore all these factors must be considered when optimizing cultivation conditions (Fig. 2). Some factors are easily measured in the environment and incorporated into the growth strategy, for example, temperature and pH. A limitation has been that many required factors are unknown and difficult to determine without cultivated isolates to test. A number of different strategies have been used to overcome this limitation, (i) development of growth media reflective of the environment of interest, (ii) enrichment of communities in the laboratory using selective conditions of interest, and (iii) enrichment of communities in their natural environment. Additionally the presence of “other organisms” that may have symbiotic relationships with targeted microbes must be considered when developing a cultivation strategy. These “other organisms” may be essential by providing needed growth factors or detrimental by producing growth inhibitors/toxins or competing for resources.Modification of growth medium and conditions Early researchers developed media mainly for the growth of human pathogens (12). The human environment is high in nutrients therefore it was necessary to modify these media for the growth of microbes from other environments, such as water and soil. Strategies such as the use of media with lower nutrient concentrations improves the isolation of marine (20), fresh water (37) and soil bacteria (47) that naturally grow in oligotrophic environments. These media can also be made from natural substrates, for example soil extract medium (69), collected from the habitat of interest to include unknown but essential growth compounds (discussed in the last section of this review) found in that environment. Specific compounds can also be added to media to select microbes with specific functional roles in an environment. This is commonly done to isolate microbes that can utilize specific nutrients (125). A great number of media have been developed for the growth of different microbes and care should be taken to choose the appropriate medium to achieve the objectives of the research being performed. Even with the use of appropriate growth medium other factors, both physical and biological, must be considered and optimized to improve cultivation efficacy. The objectives for cultivation and the environmental source of material both need to be considered when determining appropriate growth conditions. Although factors such as growth substrate, oxygen availability, temperature and pH are readily manipulated in the laboratory (91), a conscience effort must be made in choosing these conditions. For example, when growing bacterioplankton it may be better to cultivate in liquid culture medium because some of these bacteria do not form colonies at the solid-air interface (29). Although different growth media may be used in an attempt to achieve the high growth efficiency of bacteria from an environmental sample, often multiple growth conditions are not tested (107). This should be considered since most environments undergo fluctuations in nutrient, temperature, pH, and oxygen availability (15, 142). By testing multiple growth conditions researchers have been able to increase cultivation efficiency from freshwater sediment (123). The biological factors that need to be considered are the physiology of the target bacteria being cultivated and the presence of other organisms that can aid or hinder growth. Many bacteria from oligotrophic conditions have lower growth rates that require longer incubation times to produce visible colonies (49), but less dominant heterotrophs may be more competitively fit under laboratory cultivation conditions and outcompete the oligotrophs. Strategies used to improve the cultivation efficiency of slower growing bacteria are (i) to reduce inoculum size to decrease the chance of encountering competition from smaller populations of faster growing bacteria and (ii) increase incubation time to allow growth to occur (24). The inoculum dilution strategy can also decrease the possibility of exposure to growth inhibitors released by neighboring cells that are producing anti-microbial substances (44). These findings illustrate that to isolate microorganisms from the environment, in addition to the choice of growth media, other factors that should be carefully adjusted are inoculum size and incubation conditions to reflect the physiological needs of the target microbes and environmental conditions in their natural habitat.Enrichment of communities in the laboratory Laboratory enrichment using microcosms is a strategy often used to cultivate cells with specific traits that may not be numerically dominant in a sample. Enrichment enables cells with a specific trait to increase in numbers sufficient for colony formation on agar medium plates. Typically the environmental sample is amended with substrates that will enhance the growth of microbes with the trait of interest. This microcosm can also be incubated in the laboratory under physicochemical conditions reflective of the original natural environment to understand its ecology. For example, a series of different enrichments (63, 92) were performed on soil from a long-term metal-contaminated site (50) that was shown to have a spatially heterogeneous microbial community (11). These microcosms demonstrated the enrichment of different bacterial species depending on the growth substrate, electron donors and acceptors, and the presence of elevated concentrations of lead or chromate (both present at high levels in the soils). This demonstrated the diversity of bacteria present in these highly contaminated soils. Each population constituted a small proportion of the community that flourished when growth conditions were presented that provided them a competitive advantage. A variety of physicochemical conditions likely occur in these soils at different times throughout the year explaining the presence of a variety of populations that likely become dominant depending on the conditions. This demonstrates the value of microcosm enrichment to capture the microbial phylogenetic and functional diversity of certain environments.Enrichment of communities in their natural environment Despite the efforts made in media development and enrichment, the absence of growth factors from specific habitats has still hindered cultivation efforts (13). A more recent strategy being used to ensure the presence of these growth factors is to incubate cells in their natural environment using a diffusion chamber (13, 51), hollow fiber membrane chamber (5), or soil slurry membrane system (33). These incubation systems allow the distribution of growth factors from the original habitat into the media through a membrane while preventing the accessibility of cells from outside the system. This method differs from using extracts made from the habitat because microbes on the other side of the barrier can continually produce unstable or readily degraded growth factors. This strategy has increased the cultivation efficiency as well as the diversity of the microorganisms obtained. For example, using a diffusion chamber, ten different phyla of bacteria were cultivated including two phyla with few cultivated representatives (13). Instead of using filters to separate cells, another strategy being used is the encapsulation of single cells in gel microdroplets that are then exposed to the environment, allowing the exchange of molecules such as nutrient, metabolites and growth factors through the gel with no direct contact with other cells (139). Flow cytometry can then be used to sort gel microdroplets containing colonies after growth occurs. A broad range of marine bacteria, including previously uncultivated bacteria, has been isolated using this technique with a microtiter plate continuously fed filtered seawater. These results show that the presence of compounds from natural habitats in growth media is required to increase the cultivation efficiency of many yet-to-be-cultivated microbial taxa.Non-dividing cells: Groups with cultivated representatives The second group of uncultivated cells has been called viable but not culturable (VNC) or non-dividing cells. These cells were first recognized because they were being cultivated in the laboratory but due to unknown factors they were no longer dividing yet remained alive (138). VNC is defined as a state in which cells are alive but no longer growing by forming visible colonies on solid media or increasing turbidity in liquid media routinely used for their cultivation (98). Also in this category there are cells in environmental samples that remain dormant or do not begin growing in the laboratory despite having representatives that have been previously cultivated under laboratory conditions (119). It has been suggested that the term VNC is an oxymoron because growth has commonly been used as a measure of viability (7) therefore alternative terms have been used, such as, non-dividing, resting, and dormant cells (56, 58). In the following sections we describe factors that have contributed to cells entering a non-dividing state, the morphological and genetic characteristics of cells in this state, and factors that have been found that have aided in the resuscitation of these cells into a dividing state.Non-dividing cells: a resting stage Most ecosystems in nature and in the laboratory can be unstable, exposing bacteria to a variety of stresses that can be unfavorable for their growth (107). To survive stressful conditions one strategy used by bacteria is to enter a dormant or resting state and resume growth once conditions become more favorable (28). Although spores are the most studied form of resting cells they are not the focus of this manuscript because many reviews are already available on all aspects of sporulation (25, 32, 43). Instead we will focus on non-spore forming bacteria that can enter a similar resting state. The majority of research in this group has been on “viable but not culturable” food and waterborne pathogens (98, 99) because of health concerns: however, bacteria in this state also contribute to the uncultivable fraction of cells from most natural habitats in laboratory cultivation attempts. It is important to know their characteristic features to recognize cells in this state since they likely play important roles in ecosystem functions when they are in a viable state (29, 31, 66). The formation of non-dividing cells by non-spore forming bacteria has been documented in a number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (99). There are many commonalities between the resting stage of spore forming and non-spore forming bacteria. Stress factors such as alterations in nutrients, temperature and oxygen (112) as well as pH (114), and high osmotic pressure (100) have been shown to trigger non-spore forming bacteria to enter a non-dividing state. Studies have been conducted to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the entry of cells into the non-dividing state (45). In this state cells have been shown to survive extremely adverse conditions and for prolonged periods (128). Similar to spore-forming cells, the non-dividing state might be one of the strategies used by non-spore forming bacteria for survival under unfavorable conditions.Morphological characteristics of non-dividing cells Although endospores are not formed, non-spore forming bacteria also exhibit altered morphological features (Table 2) when they are in a non-dividing state that contributes to their survival. An important morphological characteristic of non-dividing cells is the change in cell wall structure and composition compared to actively growing cells. Thickening of cell walls has been observed in non-dividing Gram-positive bacteria Mycobacterium species (22) and in Gram-negative Vibrio cholerae cells (61). Furthermore, chemical analysis of the cell wall has shown an increase in 3→3 peptidoglycan crosslinks in non-dividing cells of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including Escherichia coli (117), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (65) and Enterococcus faecalis (118). The increase of 3→3 cross-links is thought to increase resistance of these cells to hydrolytic activity (65) and to make some species more resistant to mechanical disruption (118). A lower concentration of mycolic acid has been observed in non-dividing Mycobacterium smegmatis cells that potentially causes a decrease in cell wall permeability (109), which may contribute to their survival by decreasing uptake of antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents (72). These findings show that despite the lack of a spore wall, modifications to the wall of non-dividing cells contribute to survival during dormancy. Another important morphological characteristic of non-dividing cells is changes in cell membrane composition. In Gram-negative bacteria, increased saturated fatty acid composition in the phospholipid layer has been observed in Pseudomonas aureofaciens (59), V. cholerae (40), V. vulnificus (71), and E. coli (71). An increase in saturated fatty acid composition in the phospholipid layer can lead to a decrease in membrane fluidity (89) as observed in non-dividing Micrococcus luteus cells (86). Adjustment of membrane fluidity under stress is an important mechanism to maintain cytoplasmic membrane integrity, which is vital for cell viability (89). Although the benefit of decreased membrane fluidity for the survival of non-dividing cells remains to be elucidated, these observations indicate that there is a relationship between this morphological change and the dormant state.Genetic characteristics of non-dividing cells One of the genetic characteristics of endospores is that the integrity of chromosomal DNA is preserved and becomes functional when exiting the resting stage (104). Similarly, DNA preservation was also observed in non-dividing cells of non-spore forming bacteria. When observed by electron microscopy, nucleoids of non-dividing cells appeared to be more compact than actively growing cells (19, 86), but others have reported that the DNA content was not significantly changed in some cells (86) or decreased over time in other cells (133). Endogenous metabolism and protection of cells from stress conditions is essential for dormant cells to retain their viability (116). The DNA of non-dividing cells has been shown to remain functional; the expression of several genes has been reported in cells in the non-dividing state (6, 60). For example, in non-dividing M. tuberculosis cells, genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis were up regulated while those involved in energy production and conversion were down regulated (60). In non-dividing V. cholerae cells, up to 100 genes were induced, including genes responsible for DNA metabolism and other genes involved in essential cellular processes (6). Of most importance is the maintenance of DNA repair mechanisms to ensure genomic DNA is not totally degraded during the stationary phase (70); however, we should note that mutations occur more frequently in stationary cells but this is an important means of increasing genetic diversity that can lead to beneficial mutations and can provide cells with a competitive advantage when resuscitated (34).Resuscitation of cells from a “non-dividing” state To confirm the viability of non-dividing cells it is important to demonstrate that they have the potential to resume growth (99). This process proceeds through two stages, reactivation from the resting stage by a resuscitation factor followed by cell division. Bacterial communication compounds such as pheromones or cytokines can act as signals to initiate growth but in some cases resuscitation can be achieved simply by the removal of stress factors. For example, in the case of cell starvation, a simple remedy could be the restoration of nutrients (28). Another factor to consider is the need to remove compounds contributing to oxidative stress, for example H2O2, which can cause cellular damage. The loss of catalase activity in V. vulnificus when incubated at low temperature resulted in VNC cells that were sensitive to H2O2 (62). This resulted in growth inhibition when these cells were transferred to nutrient-rich agar medium and optimum temperature because of oxidative stress damage from accumulation of superoxide and free radicals. The addition of pyruvate or catalase to culture medium has been shown to restore cell growth (81, 96). In contrast to simple modifications of media it is more challenging to resuscitate cells if specific growth factors are needed (28). In the first section of this review we discussed a number of cultivation strategies that are also applicable to the growth of non-dividing cells. In the following section we review growth factors produced by bacteria that have been successfully used to cultivate non-dividing cells. These factors may also be involved in the growth of yet-to-be-cultivated bacteria, especially when using growth conditions that mimic the natural environment.Growth promotion factors and their use in cultivation Signaling compounds involved in growth stimulation have been called growth factors, autocrine growth factors, cytokines and growth-promoting factors (58). Addition of these growth factors to culture medium has been shown to resuscitate non-dividing cells in the laboratory (Table 3) and increase cell numbers grown from environmental samples (Table 4). The growth factors that have been studied most extensively are peptidoglycan fragments, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHLs). Many studies testing growth factors have been performed using pathogenic bacteria because of the significant role they play in the resuscitation, growth and virulence of clinical bacteria (28, 57), but growth factors used for the resuscitation of non-dividing cells are not limited to pathogens. By understanding the potential growth factors required for resuscitating bacteria from a non-dividing state they can be incorporated into cultivation strategies to increase cultivation efficiency from environmental samples.Peptidoglycan fragments and a resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) Fragmented cell wall peptidoglycans have been shown to act as a signaling molecule to initiate growth in both-spore forming (110) and non-spore-forming bacteria (53). Enzymatically fragmented cell wall peptidoglycans are released during exponential growth (28) for use in new cell wall synthesis (27), but these fragments have also been shown to be a signal for Bacillus subtilis endospore germination. B. subtilis spores sense the signaling molecule from neighboring cells when the peptidoglycan fragments bind to the extracellular PASTA domain of serine/threonine protein kinase, PrkC, resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase domain to form phosphorylated elongation factor G (EF-G) that is believed to play an important role in spore germination (110). A similar peptidoglycan fragment-mediated mechanism has been found in Mycobacterium exiting dormancy (53). Several Actinobacteria including M. tuberculosis produce a resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf), a muralytic enzyme that hydrolyzes peptidoglycan (56). Rpf cleaves β-1-4-glycosidic links between N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to produce peptidoglycan fragments (84). In M. tuberculosis, peptidoglycan fragments have been shown to bind to the extracellular PASTA domain of Ser/Thr kinase PknB, a homolog of PknC in B. subtilis, which resulted in an increase in the cultivability of non-dividing cells (79). Rpf as a resuscitation factor has also been documented in a number of non-pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Micrococcus luteus (85), M. smegmatis (112), and Rhodococcus rhodochrous (113). These results suggest that peptidoglycan turnover and cell wall remodeling in Gram-positive bacteria are important factors in cell resuscitation from dormancy. In studies of natural habitats, peptidoglycans were found to comprise a large fraction of dissolved organic matter in rivers (48), sea water (90), and marine sediments (103). In the laboratory, in Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, 60% of the peptidoglycan is recycled every generation and the recovery rate is efficient, resulting in very small amounts of peptidoglycan remaining in the culture medium (101). In contrast, large amounts of peptidoglycan fragments are detected in culture medium of spore-forming Gram-positive bacteria during the exponential growth phase (27), leading to the question, “Why is there differential utilization of peptidoglycans by bacterial species?” Although the major sources of peptidoglycans and turnover mechanism in the environment remain unclear there is evidence that there is differential degradation of Gram-positive and Gram-negative cell walls. Comparison of two killed marine isolates, Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp., revealed greater degradation of the Gram-positive walls in estuarine waters (48), suggesting that the peptidoglycan fragments derived from Gram-positive bacteria have functions in the environment that require further exploration.Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a molecule in signaling pathways important for regulating a variety of cellular processes in response to environmental changes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (76). The involvement of cAMP in catabolism was first demonstrated in E. coli but it is now known to be involved in regulating many functions (14, 102). In bacteria, cAMP is the second messenger in signaling pathways; it is synthesized from ATP by adenylate cyclase (AC) after its activation by an environmental signal (14, 76). The cAMP then activates an effector, most commonly the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) (102). Details of various effectors and regulatory mechanisms are reviewed in greater detail elsewhere (14, 76). Most relevant to this review is its involvement in the regulation of a number genes (36) including rpf genes (106). In nature, dissolved cAMP has been reported in freshwater (35) and seawater (2). The uptake of cAMP from seawater by marine bacterioplankton corresponded to bacterial abundance and activity, suggesting that cAMP was related to their metabolism and growth (2). Furthermore, uptake of radiolabeled cAMP by means of specific high-affinity transport systems into marine bacteria supported the hypothesis that cAMP uptake contributed to the intracellular pool of this regulatory compound (3). The addition of cAMP to growth medium has been reported to increase the cultivation efficiency of marine and freshwater bacterioplankton (15–17). From a seawater sample, 100% cultivation efficiency was reported for bacterioplankton determined by the most probable number (MPN) method in comparison to the DAPI total cell count (15). In addition to increasing cultivation efficiency, using the MPN method, addition of cAMP to growth medium was found to result in the cultivation of bacterioplankton from a eutrophic lake that were previously uncultivated (17). Furthermore, a test of the growth-promotion activity of cAMP on one marine isolate revealed an increase in growth rates and biomass, suggesting that it may serve as a signaling compound for resuscitation of non-dividing cells in the marine ecosystem (15). Based on the variety of regulatory systems activated by cAMP it is a prime candidate for consideration as an additive to media to increase cultivation efficiency.N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHLs) Bacteria use signaling compounds to communicate with other cells using quorum sensing (8, 9, 78, 132). A number of different quorum-sensing signaling molecules are involved in a variety of cellular functions. The first and most extensively studied quorum-sensing signal is N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) found in Gram-negative bacteria (8, 9, 78, 132). Others have extensively reviewed this topic and for the purposes of this review only a few characteristics will be emphasized from these papers (8, 9, 78, 132). AHL is produced intracellularly by LuxI and released from the cell. The extracellular concentration of AHL increases with increasing population density and can diffuse back into cells. When the signaling compound accumulates above a threshold level it binds to an intracellular receptor, LuxR or a homologue. The number and variety of genes regulated by quorum sensing support the need to incorporate this knowledge when developing cultivation strategies. Addition of AHL compounds to culture media has been shown to increase viable counts of bacteria isolated from environmental samples. For example, addition of N-(butyryl)-dl-homoserine lactone (BHL) and N-(oxohexanoyl)-dl-homoserine lactone (OHHL) to growth media increased the cultivation efficiency of marine bacteria from the Baltic Sea (15). Addition of AHL mixtures to growth media increased the MPN value of heterotrophic bacteria from lake water (18) and the frequency of Acidobacteria detected from soil (121). AHLs have also been reported to stimulate growth and colonization in biofilm (77), decrease the lag phase of growing bacteria after starvation (10), influence siderophore synthesis (39), control catalase and superoxide dismutase production (42), and regulate starvation survival (38). The mechanism of non-dividing cell resuscitation by AHLs in natural environments remains to be elucidated but is believed to be related to the regulation of genes associated with the growth function of quorum sensing.Other growth factors Many other growth factors have been reported to resuscitate non-dividing cells in the laboratory although the mechanistic basis remains unclear; the following are a few examples. A low concentration of oleic acid (1 μg mL−1) can resuscitate non-dividing M. smegmatis cells (93). YeaZ protein (94) from Gram-negative bacteria was used to resuscitate non-dividing Salmonella enterica serovar Oranienburg (100). An 8 kDa peptide (Rv1174c) from M. tuberculosis could resuscitate non-dividing cells (140). In environmental samples, 5-amino-acid peptides of LQPEV were identified as a growth promotion compound used to cultivate previously uncultivable cells from marine sediment (95). These findings illustrate the variety of compounds that can stimulate growth after exiting dormancy and require more in-depth study, with the likelihood that many more growth factors exist.Conclusion The phenomenon of uncultivable bacterial cells from environmental samples has resulted from our inadequate understanding of the conditions necessary for their growth and not because they are truly uncultivable. The uncultivable group is comprised of yet-to-be-cultivated cells (from groups with no cultivated representatives) and non-dividing cells (from groups with cultivated representatives). Improvement in cultivation efficiency has been achieved by incorporating knowledge of the chemical, physical and biological variables of natural habitats into cultivation strategies. Great strides have been made by modifying nutrient content of growth medium, adjustment of incubation condition, removal of growth-limiting factors and using growth environments more reflective of the original habitat. Also, there is now a better understanding of some of the underlying mechanisms that has made these cultivation strategies more efficient, such as different signaling compounds produced by cells to promote or initiate growth. In the future, by building on our current knowledge, the phenomenon of uncultivable cells may be eliminated. Attention should be paid particularly to using cultivation conditions more reflective of the natural habitat and gaining a greater understanding of growth promotion factors produced by cells for incorporation into cultivation strategies.

Doshi			IJPsy-51-216					INTRODUCTION Surgery for intractable neuropsychiatric illness has generated considerable controversy for a variety of scientific, social, and philosophical reasons. Much of the controversy relates to the widespread and indiscriminate use of psychosurgery in the 1940s and 1950s when no effective psychotropic agents were available. With the introduction of chlorpromazine in 1954, effective medical management led to a rapid decline in surgery for mental illness. Despite the vast array of new, selective psychotropic medications available today, however, many neuropsychiatric illnesses remain refractory and, consequently, some patients remain severely disabled. These patients might be considered appropriate candidates for surgery if the overall result and level of functioning could be improved. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disease characterized by anxiety-provoking thoughts (obsessions) leading to repeated, time-consuming behaviors (compulsions) that may or may not provide temporary relief. With an approximate prevalence of 2 to 3% of the general population and 0.6% in Indian population,[1] OCD is a debilitating disorder that can significantly affect nearly every aspect of a patient's life, and in some cases, lead to suicide.[2] In a meta-analysis of a database of the Food and Drug Administration, the annual suicide risk rate in OCD patients with minimal and no comorbidity, participating in a trial of selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitiors (SSRI) was 105/10000 and the annual suicide attempt risk was 1468/100000.[3] Although OCD has been recognized and studied in the psychiatric literature for nearly a century, only relatively recently has the disease been evaluated in a neuroscientific context. The application of functional imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, to this patient population, coupled with advances in the safety and efficacy of functional neurosurgical intervention, has led to a renaissance of research in this area.Neurobiological model of obsessive-compulsive disorder There is a convergence of evidence implicating the corticostriatothalamocortical (CSTC) loop involving orbitofrontal (OFC) cortex, anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) and basal ganglia as central to the pathophysiology of OCD.[4–6] Two distinct routes are conceptualized from the striatum to the thalamus; the so-called “direct” and “indirect” pathways. The direct pathway projects from the cortex to the striatum to the internal segment of globus pallidus and substantia nigra to the thalamus and then back to the cortex. The indirect pathway is similar from the cortex to the striatum but then projects to the external segment of the globus pallidus to the subthalamic nucleus, before returning to the internal segment of the the globus pallidus/substantia nigra, there joining the direct pathway to the thalamus and projecting back to the cortex. Impulses transmitted via the direct pathway disinhibit the thalamus, presumably resulting in a release of behaviors as necessary for an adaptive function. Activity in the indirect pathway inhibits the thalamus, resulting in the cessation of ongoing behavioral routine. The prevailing theory on OCD suggests that a hitherto unknown primary striatal pathologic process underlies a relative imbalance favoring striatothalamic inhibition leading to hyperactivity within OFC and ACC, the caudate nucleus (CN) and the thalamus [Figure 1]. Besides this, prefrontal cortex, cingulated cortex, limbic circuit, OFC, hypothalamus and amygdala are the other structures that communicate with this primary circuits through various feedback loops. This forms the basis of various target sites for treating OCD. Guehl et al., performed neuronal recordings from CN in three patients before Deep Brain stimulation surgery. These patients had very high Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). They found high discharge rate in the CN with variable interspike interval.[7]Figure 1 Diagram of CSTC circuitImaging correlates of obsessive-compulsive disorder Studies comparing volumes of specific brain regions in patients with OCD have often yielded conflicting and inconsistent results. Brain regions of interest have included the head of the CN, the OFC, and the ACC, as well as broader examinations of hemispheric and hippocampal asymmetry. With respect to the CN especially, studies have found increases,[8] decreases,[910] and no change[11] in volume between OCD patients and healthy controls on magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans. The source of this apparent discrepancy in the volumetric literature may be methodological in nature, with significant sample size variation, difficulty in acquiring adequate control subjects, and practical obstacles surrounding volume measurement all potentially impeding accurate and valid volume analysis. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the heterogeneity of OCD, a disease with several unique classifications and subtypes,[12] can be responsible for the inconsistent volume differences among various structures as reported in the literature. The other structure of interest is OFC, which is thought to sub serve motivational aspects of decision making and may have a role in behavioral adaptation to change, both of which have implications for OCD. Szesko et al., found that the OFC volume was decreased in patients of OCD.[9]Functional imaging in obsessive-compulsive disorder PET examines cerebral metabolism using flurodeoxyglucose. PET studies on patients with OCD confirm that elevated glucose metabolism occurs in the bilateral thalamus, caudate, and OFC regions. In PET scans of patients with OCD who exhibited compulsive hoarding as their primary symptom, lower rates of glucose metabolism were found in the anterior and posterior cingulate gyri when compared with patients who did not hoard and subjects without OCD.[6] The patients who did not hoard exhibited significantly greater activity in the bilateral thalamus and the CN. The study demonstrates differences between individuals with and without OCD, but it also indicates functional metabolic differences between patients with OCD, with patients who hoard showing different patterns of metabolism than patients who do not hoard. Similarly, in an another study of the patients who check, hypermetabolism was found in the putamen/globus pallidus, the thalamus, and the right inferior frontal cortex; in those who wash, the greatest activation was identified in the OFC, the cingulated gyrus (CG), and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Such differences underscore the complexity of OCD and the inherent challenges that exist in using imaging to explore a disease that possesses several classifications and a diverse symptomatology.[11] A more recent study examining a broader range of studies used PET and SPECT[13] for measurement. The authors point to significant differences between patients with OCD and those without OCD, particularly in areas such as the orbital gyrus and the head of the CN. These findings also suggest that frontal and subcortical regions are possible key players in OCD; however, it is yet to be determined whether the hypermetabolic states detected are the causes or the consequences of the disorder. Although significant neuroanatomic and metabolic changes seem to exist, their identification must be viewed as starting points for additional investigation into the etiology of the disease as well as potential interventions. Notwithstanding these significant difficulties, the observations collected using functional imaging suggest that hypermetabolism of frontal regions occurs in OCD and consensus is growing regarding the metabolic states of the caudate and thalamic regions.[14]Surgical treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder Surgery for OCD is reserved for patients with the most severe cases of the disease, when pharmacological and psychotherapeutic alternatives have been exhausted. Although estimates in the literature vary, there is a relative consensus that a significant minority of OCD patients, from as low as 10% and up to 40%, are treatment refractory.[15–17] Some of these patients, who remain severely ill, are eligible for surgical intervention, given appropriate inclusion criteria and availability of required psychiatric and surgical expertise. In 1891 the Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burkhardt reported on surgical procedures with craniotomy in a series of six severely agitated patients, with success in three patients.[18] John Fulton from Yale observed the calming effect of frontal lobe surgery in chimpanzee, but at the same time cautioned about translating this animal experience to human trials. Egaz moniz, a neurologist from Lisbon along with Alemida Lima performed the first prefrontal leucotomy. He was later on awarded a Nobel Prize for his work in 1949. Walter Freeman a neuorpsychiatrist from US along with his surgical colleague James Watts performed frontal transection - later on came to be known as the famous “Ice Pick” surgery. It is another story that Watts later on severed ties with Freeman following his inadvertent use of this surgery. By 1954, more than 20 thousand surgeries were performed in US and similarly more than 10 thousand in UK. Ironically, it was a surgeon, Henri Laborit from Paris, who helped end the “golden age” of psychosurgery and usher in the pharamacologic age of psychiatry by noting the tremendous benefit Chlorproamzine offered in improving psychiatric disorders. The modern era of precision psychosurgery was brought in with invention of stereotactic equipment by Spiegel and Wycis.[19] The lesions became smaller and more precise, thus avoiding several side effects with larger lesions of prestereotactic era. During the last five decades, psychosurgery continued to be practiced at select centres. The four different targets currently being used are anterior capsule (AC), CG, Subcaudate tractotomy and Limbic leucotomy [Figure 2] Nucleus accumbens is another promising target for this surgery. AC and CG are the most popular and rewarding targets for OCD and hence will be discussed in detail. Two methods of surgery are employed for altering these targets. One involves performing lesion and the other involves stimulation of these targets using deep brain stimulation (DBS). In a lesion a radiofrequency unit is used to produce (destroy) a thermal lesion of calculated volume. This is permanent and irreversible. In DBS an electrode is implanted at the site of the target and current is delivered through a pacemaker to alter the signals emanating from the target. The pacemaker is implanted in the infraclavicular region and is connected by extension wires, tunneled subcuataneously to the electrodes that are implanted in the brain. The amount of current and thereby the stimulation/inhibition of the target site can be controlled by an external programmer. DBS offers an exceptional benefit of reversibility and titrability. DBS has been in use for now over four decades for pain and movement disorders. Recently US FDA approved the use of DBS for OCD.[20] Both this procedures are performed using stereotactic techniques which offer a high degree of accuracy (within 1-2mm).Figure 2 Targets of modern psychosurgeryCingulotomy In 1937, the same year that Moniz[21] reported his initial experience with prefrontal lobotomy, Papez[22] postulated that a reverberating circuit in the human brain might be responsible for emotion, anxiety and memory. The components of this rudimentary limbic system included the hypothalamus, septal nuclei, hippocampi, mamillary bodies, anterior thalamic nuclei, CG and their interconnections. Laitinen showed that electric stimulation of the anterior cingulum and subcaudate region altered autonomic responses and anxiety levels in psychiatric patients.[23] PET studies have provided further evidence about the role of CG. In a small series of patients with chronic anxiety disorders and severe phobias, activation PET studies performed as the patients were presented with stimuli to recreate their fears demonstrated consistently increased regional cerebral blood flow in the ACC, OFC, left thalamus, and right CN.[24] Rauch et al., reported atrophy of the caudate body in subjects who had undergone one or more cingulotomies approximately six months before the MRI studies.[25] Clinical observations suggest that OCD patients do not improve immediately after psychosurgery but that several weeks to months are required for positive clinical effects to manifest.[26] Cingulotomy is carried out under mild sedation and local anaesthesia. MRI is used for defining target coordinates. Anterior CG is the preferred target site. Radiofrequency ablation is used to produce lesion. The resultant lesion involves 2.0-2.5 cm of entire thickness of anterior CG.Anterior capsulotomy/stimulation Capsulotomy was first described by Talairach in 1949 and popularized by Lars Leksell in Sweden.[2728] The goal of anterior capsulotomy is to interrupt frontothalamic connections at the point where they converge in the anterior limb of the internal capsule, between the head of the caudate and putamen [Figure 3].Figure 3 Capsulotomy/capsular stimulation target site Anatomical studies confirm that the anterior limb of the internal capsule contains the anterior thalamic radiations (connecting the frontal lobes with the medial and anterior thalamic nuclei) and the prefrontal corticopontine tract.[29] Fiber connections between OFC and striatum also cross through internal capsule. Besides this internal capsule is surrounded by other important anatomical area like bed nucleus of stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, ventral striatum which all form the part of the ventral striatopallidal complex. Interruption or modulation of these target sites forms the basis of OCD surgery. The advantage of DBS is that it can reversibly recruit neighbouring structures to improve the benefits of surgery without causing unwanted side effects. In 1999, Nutin et al., demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the anterior limbs of the internal capsules induced beneficial effects in a patient with treatment-resistant OCD during the first minutes after the initiation of stimulation.[30] Although DBS has been applied at several locations along the rostral-caudal extent of the anterior limb of the internal capsule the target used most frequently includes the junction of the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule and adjacent ventral striatum; known as the ‘VC/VS’.[31] DBS for OCD has undergone a parallel development in that the VC/VS target site has become more posterior as experience was gained, representing the greatest technical evolution from the beginning of this work in 1998. One hypothesis influencing this work is that more posterior locations may be more effective. Fibers within the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) networks hypothesized as central to the therapeutic effects of lesions or DBS[32] become more compact as they course posteriorly toward the thalamus, to which they connect via the inferior thalamic peduncle.[3334] The VC/VS may thus represent a node of CSTC circuits that is readily targeted for modulation by DBS. The surgical procedure is similar to the cingulotomy. The target is the junction of the anterior capsule and the ventral striatum, within 1-2mm of the posterior border of the anterior commissure.Other target sites Subcaudate tractotomy,[35] Limbic leucotomy and Gamma knife capsulotomy[36] are the other surgical options practiced by few groups. However, as their results are more or less similar and are less commonly practiced they will not be discussed. Of interest to note is that one group reported 89% success rate following limbic leucotomy with higher complication rates.[37] This may be due to more extensive lesions involved in limbic leucotomy (it is a combination of anterior cingulotomy and subcaudate tractotomy). Interested readers can refer to the references mentioned.Patient selection The multicentre DBS trial was the most recent and systematic approach towards the surgical treatment of OCD. Four centres recruited 26 patients over eight year period. These criteria have been accepted by the “National Advisory Committee for Psychosurgery in India” which held its first meeting on 8th March, 2009; for considering surgical interventions in OCD.Obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnosis and severity Detailed patient screening, record review, interviews with treating clinicians and baseline assessments, including the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition,[38] should be used to assure that OCD is the primary diagnosis (the disorder judged by clinicians and patients as imposing the greatest burdens of symptom and functional impairment). OCD has to be of at least 5 year's duration. YBOCS symptom intensity in the ‘severe’ range was required (score of 28 or more). OCD should be judged to cause marked functional impairment with a Global assessment of Functioning (GAF) score of 45 or less.Treatment resistance This is defined as adequate trial (≥3 months) with maximally tolerated doses of at least three serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), one of which has to be clomipramine. Trials combining an SRI with additional medications (including a neuroleptic and a benzodiazepine) should also be tried. All patients were required to have had behavior therapy, defined as a minimum of 20 sessions of therapist-guided exposure and response prevention. Patients who attempt behavioral therapy but who demonstrate marked intolerance to it (in the therapist's judgment) are eligible.Exclusion criteria Patients are excluded if there is a history of a current or past psychotic disorder, a manic episode within the preceding 3 years, any current clinically significant neurological disorder or medical illness (except for tic disorders) or any clinically significant abnormality on preoperative MRI, any labeled DBS contraindication and/or inability to undergo pre-surgical MRI, history of substance abuse or dependence or a clinical history of severe personality disorder.Independent review At each center desirous of performing OCD surgery a committee including psychiatrists not connected with the surgery, neurologist and neurosurgeon should review the clinical histories, baseline evaluations and the consent process.Other rating scores Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Beck Depression inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) should also be performed.RESULTS In a retrospective report of 198 patients undergoing cingulotomy for various psychiatric disorders, Ballantine noted 56% improvement in patients with OCD. There is generally a delay of 3-6 months in the onset of beneficial effect after cingulotomy. Using subjective rating scales, approximately 60% to 70% patients show significant improvement. When more objective clinically validated rating scales are used to assess outcome, approximately 30-45% patients are considered to be responders.[39–41] The average duration of follow-up was two years. The results are better with larger or repeat lesions. Minor symptoms of headache, low-grade fever, and nausea are common after cingulotomy but generally last less than 24-48 hours. Transient unsteady gait, dizziness, confusion, urinary retention, and isolated seizure can occur; although mild and self limiting, these symptoms may last up to several weeks. Permanent significant behavioral or cognitive decline has not been reported after cingulotomy.[42] In a review of stereotactic cingulotomy, Cosgrove and Rauch[25] described OCD treatment experience of one major centre. In 800 cingulotomies performed over a 40-year period at Massachusetts General Hospital, there were no deaths and only two infections reported. Change et al., performed pre and post operative SPECT imaging in patients undergoing cingulotomy.[43] They noted preoperative hyperperfusion in the anterior CG and post operative hypo perfusion in anterior CG and OFC following improvement in the symptoms. Leksell reported that 50% of OCD patients responded to capsulotomy. In another study, Bingley found that 25 out of 35 patients (78%) were either symptom-free or much improved an average of 35 months after thermocapsulotomy.[44] Mindus and Jenike retrospectively reviewed all cases of capsulotomy reported by the early 1990s. They judged that 64% of 213 patients for whom adequate information was available could be considered responders.[45] Anecdotally, after surgery, adherence to and success of behavioral therapy seemed much enhanced in responders. In the multicentre DBS for OCD trial the mean preoperative YBOCS was 34 ± 0.5. The postoperative improvement was gradual, similar to that observed in lesional surgeries. At three months there were 50% responders who improved to 61.5% at the last follow up and if one considers the last group of patients (who were implanted electrodes at the new target site, i.e. the posterior part of anterior limb of IC), the improvement was seen in more than 75% patients. The GAF increased from an average of 34 to 59. At last follow-up, work, school or homemaking functioning was described as fair or good in 21 of the 25 patients. Capacity for independent living was considered fair or good in 20 of 25 patients. There was also significant improvement in the co-morbid anxiety and depression. The improvement in depression and anxiety is observed earlier than the improvement in OCD symptoms. As discussed earlier DBS involves titration of optimal parameters for symptom control. During this period there is an immediate improvement in mood and anxiety providing a clue to selecting the right contact point and stimulation parameters. DBS is associated with a slightly higher incidence of complications that include hemorrhage, infection and hardware failures. In the above multicentre study there were two incidence of hemorrhage (not significant) and one incidence of hardware complications. Patients reported worsening of symptoms when their stimulators were switched off, this improved upon restarting the stimulators. O15-PET imaging in a subset of patients from this series found that acute high frequency DBS increased perfusion in OFC, ACC, striatum, pallidum and thalamus compared to control conditions.[46] Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging in a different subset of these patients found that metabolism in the subgenual CG, measured before surgery, was directly correlated with the extent of OCD improvement during DBS.[47]CONCLUSION In 1997 the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry published a supplement in the Expert Consensus Guidelines Series entitled ‘Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder’.[48] The guideline states ‘In the adult with extremely severe and unremitting OCD, neurosurgical treatment to interrupt specific brain circuits that are malfunctioning can be very helpful’. However, it seems that surgical therapy for intractacble OCD may be underused. It is 12 years since this guidelines and today we are at a very fortunate period where our understanding of OCD has improved and so has the surgical therapy. The modern neurosurgical practice, including DBS, has made surgical interventions less risky. The reversibility and titrability which DBS provides would help the fence sitters also to take a surgical decision. Surgery, however, is not the end of the disease story. It would need preoperative and postoperative active participation from the psychiatrists to manage these patients, as the responsibility and commitment towards the patient care would increase following surgery.

In , shortage of potassium (K) induces a number of genes related to the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA). Using comparative microarray analysis of wild-type and mutant plants, we classified transcriptional responses to K with respect to their dependence on COI1, a central component of oxylipin signaling. Expression profiles obtained in a short-term experiment clearly distinguished between COI1-dependent and COI1-independent K-responsive genes, and identified both known and novel targets of JA-COI1-signaling. During long-term K-deficiency, -16 mutants displayed responses covering similar functions as COI1-targets except for defense. A putative role of JA for enhancing the defense potential of K-deficient plants was further supported by the observation that plants grown on low K were less damaged by thrips than plants grown with sufficient K.

INTRODUCTION Potassium (K) is an essential macronutrient for all living organisms due to vital functions in enzyme activation, protein synthesis, solute transport and osmoregulation (Marschner, 1995; Oria-Hernandez et al., 2005). In the field, the demand for K of young, fast-growing crops is high and therefore K supply can become yield-limiting even when fertilizers are applied (Syers, 1998; Dobermann et al., 1999). K-deficiency impacts not only on crop yield, but also on crop quality, taste, mechanical properties and stress resistance (Marschner, 1995; Laegreid et al., 1999; Amtmann, 2009). High and low-affinity K transport proteins facilitate uptake of K from the soil and its reallocation between different tissues (Epstein et al., 1963; Maathuis and Sanders, 1996; for review, see Amtmann et al., 2004; Ashley et al., 2006). Regulation of these transporters has been an area of intensive research (reviewed in Véry and Sentenac, 2003; Amtmann and Blatt, 2009), and the recent discovery of the Ca/CBL/CIPK pathway (Li et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006) has further enhanced our understanding of how plants adjust K uptake to the external K supply. Such control mechanisms endow plants with the capacity for efficient cellular and whole-plant K homeostasis (Walker et al., 1996), thereby allowing them to cope with transient fluctuations of external K. If K-deficiency persists, plants have to initiate a much wider adaptive response, which involves re-prioritization of growth, development and metabolism to ensure maximal seed production under nutrient-limited conditions. Field and glasshouse trials have produced a vast amount of data on the physiological consequences of K-deficiency (reviewed in Kafkafi et al., 2001), but it is not known which of these reflect unavoidable damage and which have adaptive function. Even less is known about the underlying regulatory mechanisms. A role of the ethylene pathway in K-perception and signaling in the roots is now emerging (Shin and Schachtman, 2004; Amtmann et al., 2005; Shin et al., 2005; Schachtman and Shin, 2006; Amtmann and Armengaud, 2007; Pandey et al., 2007; Jung et al., 2009) but we still lack essential information about the signaling pathways that integrate adaptive responses to K-deficiency in the leaves. Previous microarray analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana plants subjected to changes in external K supply indicated that the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) could also be involved in plant responses to K-deficiency (Armengaud et al., 2004). K-responsiveness at the transcript level was found for enzymes involved in JA biosynthesis (e.g. lipoxygenase, LOX2) and known targets of JA-signaling (e.g. vegetative storage protein, VSP2; see Figure 3 in Armengaud et al., 2004). A search with Genevestigator (Zimmermann et al., 2004) shows that most of these genes respond also to treatments with methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) or the JA precursor OPDA (see Supplemental Figure A in SI4). The transcriptional profile suggested a reversible increase in JA levels during K-deficiency (Amtmann et al., 2004), and this was subsequently confirmed by others (Cao et al., 2006). JA is known to integrate plant responses to developmental and environmental cues, such as senescence, wounding, and defense (Creelman and Mullet, 1997), but had not previously been linked to nutrient stress. From the transcript profiles and the existing knowledge of JA-dependent processes, we developed a model in which JA links a K-deficiency signal to a number of physiological responses (see Figure 5 in Armengaud et al., 2004), including growth inhibition (Staswick et al., 1992), nutrient recovery from senescent tissues (He et al., 2002), production of organic cations (Perez-Amador et al., 2002), as well as control of ion transport and stomatal closure (Evans, 2003; Munemasa et al., 2007). While this scheme provided a useful working model to test possible roles of JA in plant adaptation, it lacked direct evidence for JA-dependence of the underlying transcript responses to K. The JA-signaling pathway involved in responses to MeJA treatment, wounding and biotic stress has been studied extensively (Balbi and Devoto, 2008). A central role was assigned to COI1, a F-box protein that determines the substrate specificity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFC°I1 complex (Xie et al., 1998; Devoto et al., 2005; Devoto and Turner, 2005; Yan et al., 2009). This complex targets proteins that act as repressors of JA-induced transcriptional responses for degradation, and thus constitutes a central component of JA-signaling (Staswick, 2008). Recently, it was shown that COI1 itself is a receptor for Ile-JA (Yan et al., 2009). In this study, we have used microarrays to evaluate which transcriptional responses of A. thaliana plants to varying external K supply require the presence of a functional COI1 gene by comparing transcriptional responses in wild-type with those in coi1-16 mutants. Clearly, microarray analysis can only be a first step towards unraveling the role of COI1 in the complex regulatory network underlying plant responses to K. Nevertheless, the analysis clearly showed that the number of genes responding to K-treatment was reduced in coi1-16 mutants. Based on a quantitative comparison of transcript changes between wild-type and coi1-16 plants K-responsive genes were assigned into four classes of transcript profiles with respect to external K supply and COI1-dependence. While many genes responded to K in a COI1-dependent manner, the function of COI1 in plant adaptation to K-stress seems to be redundant because coi1-16 mutants are not affected in their growth under long-term K-starvation. However, experiments with herbivorous insects indicate that a necessary function of COI1 in low K is apparent when K-deficiency is accompanied by biotic stress.RESULTSPhysiological and Developmental Phenotype of coi1-16 Plants on Low K To investigate the role of COI1 in plant responses to K-deficiency, we analyzed the phenotype of coronatine-insensitive (coi) 1–16 mutants (Ellis and Turner, 2002). There was no indication that coi1-16 plants were more severely affected by K-starvation than wild-type plants. The relative reduction in fresh weight caused by low K was even slightly less in coi1-16 mutants than in wild-type (Table 1). No significant differences between K-deficient wild-type and coi1-16 mutant plants were detected concerning water or K content (Table 1). However, coi1-16 mutants flowered earlier than the wild-type in control medium, and this phenotype was enhanced on low K (Figure 1). While wild-type plants flowered approximately 10 d earlier in low K than in control medium, coi1-16 plants flowered more than 20 d earlier in low K than in control medium.Table 1.

Onset of Flowering in a Population of Wild-Type and coi1-16 A. thaliana Plants. Plants were grown hydroponically in control or low-K medium. At each time point, the number of plants that flowered was counted. For each genotype and condition, the time point at which 50% of the plants flowered is indicated with a dashed line.Reduced Number of K-Responsive Transcripts in coi1-16 Plants To investigate the requirement of a functional JA-COI1-signaling pathway for transcriptional responses to K, we repeated microarray experiments previously carried out with wild-type plants (Armengaud et al., 2004) with coi1-16 mutant plants. As before, two treatments were applied (Armengaud et al., 2004). In a long-term-starvation experiment, plants were grown from germination for 2 weeks on a medium that was not supplied with K (‘K-free’ medium; see Methods). In short-term re-supply experiments, K-starved plants were supplied with K (or K-free medium as control) for 6 h. Shoot material was harvested from three separately grown plant batches. RNA was isolated, labeled, and hybridized to A. thaliana microarrays (University of Arizona) as before. For each treatment, genes were ranked in two lists (one for up and one for down-regulation) according to the strength and significance of their response across the replicate experiments using Rank Products (Breitling et al., 2004). Detailed information on all genes that showed K-dependent transcript changes in coi1-16 is provided in the Supplementary Information SI1. As expected, if JA plays an important role in K-signaling, the total number of K-responsive genes was smaller in coi1-16 than in wild-type plants (Table 2). The effect was particularly evident for genes up-regulated during K-starvation and down-regulated upon K re-supply, which was indeed the transcriptional profile most clearly related to JA in wild-type plants (Armengaud et al., 2004).Table 2.

Vector Analysis (Breitling et al., 2005) has several advantages over other methods for comparative microarray data analysis. In particular, it does not require pre-assignment of transcripts into K-‘regulated’ and ‘non-regulated’ genes, thereby avoiding wrong interpretation of transcript changes lying closely at either side of a cut-off value (e.g. 1.9-fold and 2.1-fold) as being ‘different’, or of those lying above the cut-off but displaying large differences (e.g. two-fold and 20-fold) as being ‘the same’. For each gene, fold-changes of transcript levels measured in coi1-16 were plotted against wild-type fold-changes (nine pair-wise comparisons from three replicates). Based on the direction of the resulting sum vector, the obtained transcriptional responses were assigned into four main classes (Figure 2A), namely ‘same regulation’ (up or down-regulated in both genetic backgrounds), ‘loss of regulation’ (up or down-regulated in wild-type but unchanged in coi1-16), ‘gain of regulation’ (unchanged in wild-type but up or down-regulated in coi1-16), and ‘opposite regulation’ (up-regulated in wild-type and down-regulated in coi1-16 or vice versa). Statistical evaluation of the transcript behavior was based on three parameters: the average length of the replicate vectors (l) as a measure of overall strength of the response, the length of the sum vector (p) as a measure of the consistency of the response across replicates, and the angle between the sum-vector and the closest prototypic vector (a) as a measure of the clarity of the response. Figure 2A shows the relative number of genes identified for each class after applying a common set of statistical constraints (see Methods). The analysis was carried out separately for long-term K-starvation and short-term K-re-supply.Figure 2. Effect of COI1 on K-Dependent Gene Expression. (A) Comparison of transcriptional profiles between wild-type and coi1-16 mutant plants. The scheme on the left shows the assignment of sum vectors obtained by Vector Analysis into regulatory classes. For each gene, fold-changes of transcript levels measured in coi1-16 in response to K-starvation or K re-supply are plotted against the respective wild-type fold-changes resulting in nine vectors (from three replicate experiments). The direction of the sum vector allows assignment of the obtained transcriptional responses into four regulatory groups, namely ‘same regulation’ (green), ‘loss of regulation’ (yellow), ‘gain of regulation’ (red), and ‘opposite regulation’ (blue). Prototypic sum vectors ideally representing each regulatory class are drawn. Genes with sum vectors in gray areas were excluded from further analysis based on inconsistency of the response or ambiguity of the classification. The chart on the right shows the relative number of genes identified for each class (same color-coding as on the left) after applying a common set of statistical constraints (see Methods). Upper bar: K-starvation (104 transcripts in total). Lower bar: K re-supply (129 transcripts in total). For individual genes, see Tables 3 and 4, and SI2. (B) Examples of expression profiles within the four regulatory classes. Transcripts were identified as belonging to a particular regulatory class (same color coding as in (A)) for K-starvation, re-supply, or both treatments. R1–R3 denote replicate experiments of the same treatment, fold-changes are given in boxes, up-regulation is shown in pink, down-regulation in green. (C) Functional categories of genes displaying loss or gain of regulation by K in coi1-16 mutants. For individual genes, see SI2. Note that defense-related genes were not represented among genes that gained responsiveness to K in coi1-16.Table 3.

K-Deficiency Reduced Thrips Damage on A. thaliana. (A) Typical appearance of control (left) or K-starved (right) Arabidopsis thaliana Col0 wild-type plants exposed to thrips (Frankliniella sp., middle inset, bar is 100 μm). Insect bites are visible as white spots on the leaves of control plants. Bar = 1 cm. (B) Numbers of insect bites on leaves of control (black bars) or K-starved (white bars) wild-type plants. Forty plants were analyzed for each condition. Average numbers of bites for different leaf sizes (large: >25 mm2, medium: 10–25 mm2, small: <10 mm2 leaf surface) are shown. All differences are significant at p < 0.001 (t-test). (C) Numbers of insect bites on leaves of control (black bars) or K-starved (white bars) wild-type and mutant plants. Mutants were defective for JA-dependent indolic gucosinolate production (cyp79b2/b3) or JA-signaling through COI1 (coi1-16). A color version of this figure is available from the Supplemental Material (SI6). Interestingly, the effect of COI1 disruption on K-dependent transcriptional changes differed considerably between the two K treatments. In response to K re-supply, most of the transcripts showed either the same regulation in the two genotypes (56%) or a loss of K-dependence in coi1-16 mutants (36%). By contrast, after long-term starvation, only 15% of all K-regulated genes showed the same response in coi1-16 and wild-type, while the majority of transcripts (65%) displayed changes in coi1-16 but not in wild-type plants (‘gain of regulation’). Figure 2B shows examples of transcriptional profiles represented in the different regulatory classes. All genes assigned to a particular regulatory class are listed in Tables 3 (K-starvation) and 4 (K re-supply), and their transcriptional profiles are presented in the Supplementary File SI2. Many genes were quickly down-regulated upon re-supply of K in the wild-type (Armengaud et al., 2004). This response was significantly attenuated in coi1-16 mutants in the case of at least 45 genes (Table 4 and Supplementary File SI2), including vegetative storage protein VSP2 (At5g24770), the cytochrome P450 CYP79B3 (At2g22330, involved in glucosinolate production (Hull et al., 2000), and a number of myrosinase-associated and myrosinase-binding proteins (e.g. MBP1, At1g52040), as well as several stress and defense-related transcripts such as the dehydration-responsive NAC transcription factor RD26 (At4g27410), an aspartyl protease (At1g79720), and a disease resistance protein (At3g25020, Yamaguchi-Shinozaki et al., 1992). COI1-dependence was also found for down-regulation of genes encoding the cation co-transporter CAX7 (At5g17860), several metabolic enzymes (ARGAH2, At4g08870; MGD3, At2g11810; PEPCK, At4g37870; GSTU4, At2g29460), as well as regulatory proteins (putative caltracin At2g46600, serine threonine protein kinase At5g15080, protein phosphatase 2C At5g59220, growth regulating factor AtGRF2, At4g37740; Kim et al., 2003). Up-regulation of AGP17 (At2g23130) encoding an arabinogalactan protein (Sun et al., 2005) and an acyl-CoA synthetase-like protein (At2g17650) by K re-supply was also lost in the coi1-16 mutant. By contrast, the response to K of ADC2 (At4g34710, SPE2), encoding arginine decarboxylase required for polyamine biosynthesis, was unchanged in coi1-16, despite the fact that ADC2 expression has been reported to be JA-dependent (Perez-Amador et al., 2002). This confirms the notion that JA also employs COI1-independent-signaling pathways (Devoto et al., 2005). During long-term starvation (Table 3 and Supplementary File SI2), ‘loss of regulation’ in coi1-16 plants was again apparent for well known downstream targets of JA that were up-regulated in wild-type plants, namely VSP1 (At5g24780), PDF1.2a (At5g44420), and PDF1.3 (At2g26010 (Staswick, 1984; Penninckx et al., 1998). However, in this experiment, the majority of genes ‘gained’ K responsiveness in coi1-16 (unchanged in wt but up or down-regulated in coi1-16; Figure 2A). ‘Gain of regulation’ was displayed by genes encoding transcription factors (e.g. ethylene-responsive ERF, At5g61590; Nakano et al., 2006), and auxin-responsive ARF18, At3g61830 (Okushima et al., 2005), and regulatory proteins (e.g. RABH1C, At4g39890, and PLC2, At3g08510; Otterhag et al., 2001; Vernoud et al., 2003), as well as metabolic enzymes (e.g. BMY7, At3g23920, and MAP1C, At1g13270; Ross et al., 2005; Sparla et al., 2006) and transporters (e.g. GLR2.3, At2g24710, and ACA4, At2g41560; Geisler et al., 2000).‘Gain of Regulation’ in coi1-16 Mutants under Long-Term K-Stress Excludes Defense-Related Genes The large number of ‘gain-of-regulation’ transcripts in long-term-starved coi1-16 plants suggests that if given enough time, the mutants initiate new responses to K-stress. Since some of these might compensate for the lack of JA-related responses, their functional spectrum could provide a clue to the physiological role of JA in plant adaptation to low K. We therefore compared predicted functions of genes ‘gaining’ responsiveness during long-term starvation with those of genes displaying ‘loss of regulation’ upon short-term K re-supply (likely to be direct targets of JA-signaling). Although there was no evidence for gene-by-gene replacement (e.g. replacement of one family member by another), similar functional categories were represented by ‘loss’ and ‘gain-of-regulation’ genes, suggesting that the latter may serve a compensatory role in coi1-16 mutants (Figure 2C and Supplementary File SI2). The only functional category represented among ‘loss-of-regulation’ but not among ‘gain-of-regulation’ genes was ‘defense’. The fact that COI1-dependent induction of defense-related genes could be lost without causing a physiological phenotype indicates that it is not required for plant adaptation to K-deficiency under sterile laboratory conditions.Plants in Low-K Conditions Are Less Prone to Thrips Attack The large number of defense-related genes induced by K-starved A. thaliana plants raises the question whether increased JA-production protects K-deficient plants against additional biotic stress. Thrips (Frankliniella sp.) are among the most vicious insect pests affecting cultivated plants. In a recent study, it was shown that numbers and feeding of Frankliniella occidentalis on A. thaliana and Brassica rapa were reduced by pre-treating plants with JA, whereas coi1-1 plants were hypersensitive to thrips (Abe et al., 2009). We therefore investigated whether K nutrition had an effect on thrips attack of hydroponically grown A. thaliana plants and whether this effect was dependent on COI1. Plants were initially grown in K-sufficient control medium to eliminate any effects related to plant size and leaf surface, subsequently exposed to a medium lacking K to induce a JA response, and finally transferred to a growth chamber infested with thrips (Frankliniella sp.; Figure 3A). To quantify thrips attack, we counted insect bites, visible as chlorotic spots on the leaves (Figure 3A). Numbers of bites were assessed separately for leaves within three size classes. Wild-type and coi1-16 mutant plants in low-K and control medium were grown in parallel to ensure identical thrips exposure and accompanying conditions. Over an observation time of 2 weeks, K-starved wild-type plants contracted significantly lower numbers of bites than K-sufficient plants, independent of leaf size (Figure 3B). For coi1-16 plants, thrips-inflicted damage was lethal within a few days (insets in Figure 3A) in both control and low-K plants, and individual bites could no longer be distinguished (Figure 3C). Mutants deleted in CYP79B2 and B3, two genes required for the (JA-dependent) production of indolic glucosiolates, showed similar levels of thrips attack and a similar difference between K-sufficient and K-starved plants as wild-type plants (Figure 3C), suggesting that neither the high susceptibility of coi1-16 plants nor the low susceptibility of K-starved wild-type plants were due to changes of indolic glucosinolate levels.DISCUSSIONPhenotype of coi1-16 Mutants on Low K Despite the differences in gene expression between coi1-16 and wild-type plants on low K, there was no striking difference in growth, water or K content. In agreement with this finding, no genes encoding known K-transporters or regulators of these featured among COI1-dependent K-responsive genes. We conclude that JA/COI1-signaling does not play a major role in regulating uptake or root-shoot allocation of K. However, coi1-16 plants did flower earlier than wild-type plants, particularly on low K. In accordance with existing knowledge that (1) JA is an important signal for senescence (Reinbothe et al., 2009), (2) K-deficiency induces senescence and the expression of senescence-related genes (Armengaud et al., 2004; Cao et al., 2006), and (3) this induction is inhibited by salicylic acid (probably through antagonistic function with JA), early flowering in coi1-16 mutants could indicate defective nutrient recovery from senescent leaves, which is particularly important under long-term nutrient shortage. The fact that wild-type plants also flowered earlier in low-K conditions (albeit to a lesser extent than coi1-16) supports a linkage between early flowering and K-deficiency. This issue should be investigated in the future by fine-mapping K-concentration in different tissues and at different developmental stages in both genotypes.Treatments and K Status of the Plants As before, two treatments were applied to assess transcriptional responses of the plants to external K supply. In a long-term starvation experiment, plants were grown from germination for 2 weeks on a medium that was not supplied with K (but contained traces of K at the beginning of the experiment; see Methods). This experiment was designed to reveal long-term adaptive responses of the plants to K-deficiency but will also, to a minor extent, reflect secondary changes caused by deficiency symptoms. We have reported before that the K-starved plants had significantly lower root and shoot K-concentrations than the control plants but showed no visible symptoms until day 12, probably due to effective K-uptake and redistribution (Armengaud et al., 2004, 2009). Over the last 2 d before harvest, the plants developed K-deficiency symptoms in the form of leaf chlorosis, decrease in shoot growth rate, and arrest of lateral root growth, indicating that whole-plant K levels had reached a critical level. Indeed, cytoplasmic K in epidermal root cells had fallen to low mM concentrations (Armengaud et al., 2009). We also previously recorded changes in the metabolite spectrum (especially with respect to reducing sugars, organic acids, and glutamate/glutamine ratio) but not the total protein or chlorophyll content (Armengaud et al., 2009), suggesting that the plants had successfully adjusted their growth, photosynthetic rate, and metabolism to the limited nutrient supply (Amtmann and Armengaud, 2009; Tschoep et al., 2009). A short-term K re-supply experiment (6 h K re-supply to K-deficient plants) was designed to identify early signals and responses directly linked to the K-stimulus. As reported before, during this period of time, root K-concentrations increased but there was no change in growth, shoot K-concentration or visible symptoms (Armengaud et al., 2004). The fact that many transcripts, metabolites and enzymes displayed opposite changes in response to long-term starvation and short-term re-supply (Armengaud et al., 2004, 2009) indicated not only that these changes were indeed directly related to the K supply, but also that the K-starved plants were still capable of quickly reversing their responses to K-deficiency. The experimental design also ensured that measured transcript responses were not linked to changes in other ions in the medium, as these differed between the treatments (Armengaud et al., 2004).Genotypic Differences To assess the dependency of transcript changes on a functional JA-COI1-signaling pathway, we compared transcript profiles of coi1-16 mutants to those previously obtained for Col0 wild-type plants. It should be noted that coi1-16 mutants differ from Col0 wild-type in two other genes: GL1 (Ellis and Turner, 2002) and PEN2 (Westphal et al., 2008). It could therefore be possible that some of the identified differences between coi1-16 and wild-type are in fact caused by gl1 or pen2. A previous microarray study of A. thaliana plants subjected to MeJA, herbivorous insects, and wounding investigated the contribution of gl1 to the gl1coi1 transcriptome (Reymond et al., 2004), and found it to be generally small. Comparison of our data with their data shows a good overlap not only between transcript responses to K-treatments and herbivore attack, but also between COI1-dependence of these changes (Supplemental Table SI3). For all genes that had significantly lower response to both K and herbivores in the coi1 genotype than in the wild-type (marked with ** in SI3), the difference between gl1 mutant and wild-type (if any) was considerably smaller than between gl1/coi1 mutant and wild-type, and can therefore be assigned to COI1. The good overlap between our results and those from Reymond and colleagues (who used a different coi1 mutant from the one used here) is particularly reassuring in the light of the recent finding that the coi1-16 mutant contains a hitherto unidentified mutation in PEN2 (Westphal et al., 2008). PEN2 is a glycosyl hydrolase that converts 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate to downstream products with antifungal properties (Bednarek et al., 2009). We carried out a qPCR analysis for a number of K-responsive genes (selected for their COI1 (in-)dependence and possible relation to glucosinolate biosynthesis in general and PEN2 in particular). As shown in Supplemental Figure SI4, in all cases but one, the response to K was similar between pen2 mutants and wild-type and different between pen2 and coi1-16 mutants (Supplemental Figure SI5). The only gene for which a significant effect of the pen2 mutation on its response to low K was found was At5g28510, encoding a glucosyl hydrolase (marked with * in Table 3) closely related to PEN2. The response of another gene of the same family (BG1, AtAt1g52400) did not differ between pen2 and wild-type. We conclude that the effects of GL1 and PEN2 on K-responsiveness are minor compared to COI1. Nevertheless, future studies investigating specific genes listed in Tables 3 and 4 should confirm their COI1 dependence in other coi1 lines.Transcript Profiles Identify Known and Novel Targets of JA-Signaling A central role of JA-signaling through COI1 in plant responses to varying K supply was apparent in the fact that the total number of K-responsive transcripts was significantly smaller in coi1-16 than in wild-type plants. Based on a quantitative comparison of transcript changes between coi1-16 and wild-type plants, we assigned all transcripts into four main categories, and those abiding to strict statistical constraints are shown in Tables 3 and 4 (see Methods for statistical cut-offs). The observation that several known JA/COI1 targets had lost responsiveness to K-starvation (e.g. VSP1 and PDFs; Table 3) and/or K re-supply (e.g. VSP2 and Thi2.1; Table 4) in coi1-16 validated our experimental approach. We also explored how the transcripts listed in Tables 3 and 4 responded to other conditions using Genevestigator (Zimmermann et al., 2004). Most of the ‘loss-of-regulation’ transcripts but very few ‘same-regulation’ transcripts displayed a strong response to OPDA and MeJA treatments (Supplemental Figure SI4, B–E). This adds further support to the notion that the categories identified here separate well between genes that respond to K through the oxylipin-COI1-signaling pathway and those that do not. Particular suitability of the short-term K re-supply experiment to identify novel K-dependent COI1 targets was evident in the fact that the transcriptional profiles of coi1-16 plants showed a clear separation between JA/COI1-dependent and JA/COI1-independent K-regulated transcripts (Figure 2). More than half of the genes that were previously identified as K-regulated in the wild-type displayed the same response to K re-supply in coi1-16 plants (Figure 2A), which indicates that the loss of responsiveness in other genes was indeed due to a lack of COI1 function rather than a general problem with transcriptional regulation. Novel targets of JA/COI-signaling identified in the re-supply experiment (Table 4) include genes with function in transport, primary metabolism, and cell wall composition, which are likely to be related to previously reported reversible changes in primary metabolism (pyruvate kinase), membrane potential, and growth during plant adaptation to low K (Armengaud et al., 2009), as well as a number of regulatory proteins (Table 4). Identification of genes that were significantly independent of COI1 in their response to K (‘same regulation’) are also interesting, as they will include upstream components of the JA/COI1 pathway and/or components of parallel signaling pathways. For example, we identified COI1-independent up-regulation by low K of JAZ1 (Table 3), a repressor of JA-dependent transcription that is regulated by JA via protein degradation (Thines et al., 2007). Transcriptional induction of JAZ1 is likely to exert a negative feedback regulation during transient JA responses; however, fast induction of JAZ1 after wounding and herbivore attack is COI1-dependent (Chung et al., 2008).‘Gain’ of Regulation in coi1-16 Mutants during Long-Term K-Deficiency Long-term K-starvation produced very different transcript profiles. Here, the majority of genes ‘gained’ K-responsiveness in the coi1-16 background. In most cases, this involved a transcriptional down-regulation that did not occur in wild-type plants. A function of COI1 in repressing K-regulation of these genes is unlikely, as such function should be similarly apparent during short-term re-supply (as ‘gain of regulation’ with opposite changes in the same transcripts), which was not the case. It is more likely that the coi1-16 plants induce new responses to K-starvation because they experience a different physiological state under K-deficiency from wild-type plants. This raises the question of whether the K-regulated genes in coi1-16 mutants functionally compensate for the lack of JA-mediated responses, and thus account for the absence of a growth phenotype in low K. ‘Gain-of-regulation’ genes covered indeed similar functional categories as direct COI1-targets identified in the K re-supply experiment (e.g. metabolism, cell wall modification and transport; Figure 2C) and included a number of ethylene and auxin-responsive genes, indicating that coi1-1 mutants mobilize alternative pathways. Defense-related genes constituted the only functional category of K-responsive genes that lost responsiveness to K re-supply in coi1-16 but did not feature among ‘gain-of-regulation’ transcripts in K-starved coi1-16 plants. Considering that this class was the largest class of K-regulated genes in the wild-type, it is surprising that the observed changes should be unnecessary for plant adaptation to low K. One possible explanation is that an increase in JA-mediated defense during K-deficiency has evolved to counteract their increased susceptibility to biological enemies (discussed below). In this case, the real advantage of a JA/COI1 response to K-deficiency would remain unnoticed in sterile laboratory conditions. In this context, it is interesting that many of the transcripts identified by Reymond et al. (2004) as regulated by herbivorous insects (S. littoralis and P. rapa) also responded to at least one of the K-treatments (Supplemental Table SI3). Considerably less overlap was found between K and MeJA treatment or wounding (Supplemental Table SI3).‘Prophylactic’ Defense against Insects in K-Deficient Plants? Investigating the effect of the K-deficiency-induced rise in JA on plant resistance against pathogens and pest is not an easy undertaking, as K-deficiency causes several changes in the plants that ease the attack (e.g. weakened skeleton and cell wall), improve the feeding quality (e.g. higher content of low-molecular sugars and nitrogen compounds), and increase the relative damage (smaller leaf size) (Amtmann et al., 2008). Even if partially offset by increased defense, one would therefore still expect to see more damage in K-deficient plants. We tried to eliminate the above factors by growing the plants first with sufficient K for a period of time before removing K from the growth medium. This yielded plants that were comparable in size but nevertheless induced a JA signal (enhanced LOX2 expression). After transfer to a thrips-infested growth chamber, the low-K plants suffered considerably less damage from the herbivorous insect than the control plants (Figure 3B). The observations suggest that the main function of JA/COI1 in K-deficient plants is to enhance their defense potential against herbivorous insects and other biological enemies. Such ‘prophylaxis’ could be advantageous, especially in small plants, which cannot afford to loose a substantial proportion of their leaf surface to herbivory. Unfortunately, insect damage of the coi1-16-mutants was so rapid and devastating that it was impossible to measure quantitative differences between control and K-deficient mutant plants. The difference in insect attack between control and low-K wild-type plants is clearly not due to JA-induced production of indolic glucosinolates (see up-regulation of CYP79B in K-deficient plants, Table 3) because it is still apparent in cyp79b2/b3 mutants that are defective in this pathway (Mikkelsen et al., 2003). More detailed experiments are now required to consolidate our hypothesis that K-deficiency induces a ‘prophylactic’ defense response via JA and COI1.METHODSPlant Material and Growth Conditions Arabidopsis thaliana (Col0 wild-type or mutants coi1-16) plants were grown on sterile vertical agar plates or hydroponically as described previously (Maathuis et al., 2003; Armengaud et al., 2004). The composition of the nutrient media was (in mM) 1.25 KNO3, 0.5 Ca(NO3)2, 0.5 MgSO4, 0.625 KH2PO4, NaH2PO4, 2 NaCl in the control medium, and 1.0 Ca(NO3)2, 0.5 MgSO4, 0.625 NaH2PO4, 1.375 NaCl in the –K (‘K-free’) medium. Both media contained the following micronutrients (in μM): 42.5 FeNaEDTA, 0.16 CuSO4, 45 H3BO3, 0.015 (NH4)6Mo7O24, 0.01 CoCl2, 0.38 ZnSO4, 1.8 MnSO4 (both media). Final concentrations of the altered ion in the two media, control (‘K-free’), were 1.875 (0) mM K, 0.5 (1) mM Ca2+, 1.25 (1) mM NO3– and 2 (1.375) mM Cl–. Plates contained 70 ml medium, supplemented with 3% sucrose and 1% agar (Type A, Sigma, Poole, UK). This agar contains a small amount of K (approx 80 μM), which is rapidly depleted by the growing plants. Changes in root and shoot K contents over the course of the long-term-starvation experiment and after K re-supply have been documented before (Armengaud et al., 2004, 2009). K re-supply to plants growing on plates with K-free medium consisted in replacing the condensed solution at the bottom of the Petri dishes with 5 ml K-free medium supplemented with 10 mM KCl. As a control, K-free medium was given instead. Plates were positioned vertically under a light source (16 h/d at 100 μE) at a constant temperature of 22°C. For thrips experiments, plants were grown hydroponically in short days (9 h light at 200 μE) on control medium for 7 d and subsequently exposed to K-free medium for 4 weeks (control plants had a continuous supply of K) before being transferred to a growth chamber infested with thrips (Frankliniella sp.). Insect bites on leaves were counted 2 weeks later.Microarray Experiments and Data Analysis RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and direct Cy3 and Cy5 labeling of cDNA were performed as previously described (Armengaud et al., 2004). Glass arrays spotted with the Arabidopsis Genome Oligo Set version 1.0. (Qiagen) were obtained from D. Galbraith (University of Arizona). Array preparation, hybridization, washing, scanning (ScanArray Express scanner and software suite, Perkin Elmer, Warrington, UK), and signal quantification (QuantArray, Perkin Elmer, Warrington, UK) were carried out as described previously (Armengaud et al., 2004). Hybridization signals for control and treatment were quantile-normalized (Bolstad et al., 2003). Genes were sorted by their normalized expression ratio for each replicate in ascending and descending order. Rank products (RPs) across replicates were calculated for each gene (Breitling et al., 2004). Comparison between transcript changes in wild-type and coi1-16 mutants was performed using vector analysis (Breitling et al., 2005). For each gene expression, changes in the two genetic backgrounds were represented by a vector in a Cartesian plane. The length of the sum vector resulting from nine pair-wise comparisons across three replicate experiments was calculated using a Perl script (Breitling et al., 2005) and compared to 100 random permutations of the original dataset, thus generating a consistency p-value. To eliminate inconsistent responses, only transcripts yielding p-values less than 0.01 were considered. The overall strength of the response, l, was given by the average length of the nine individual vectors and only transcripts with l greater than 0.5 were chosen for further analysis. The angle between the sum vector and a prototypic vector was used for assignment into regulatory classes (Figure 2A and Supplementary Information SI2). To avoid ambiguous assignment, only those transcripts producing sum vectors that deviated by less than 15 degrees from the closest prototype were considered.Microarray Data A search engine based on AGI codes for expression profiles in roots and shoots of wild-type plants grown under different K-conditions is provided at www.brc.dcs.gla.ac.uk/∼rb106x/Arabidopsis_results.htm.

Introduction Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome is a relatively common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age group. It is found in around 70% of women who have ovulation difficulties leading to subfertility. Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome is a condition that has cysts on the ovaries that prevent the ovaries from performing normally. Symptoms of Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome include Amenorrhea or infrequent menstruation, irregular bleeding, infrequent or no ovulation, multiple immature follicles, increased levels of male hormones, male pattern baldness or thinning hair, excess facial and body hair growth, acne, oily skin or dandruff, dark coloured patches of skin specially on neck, groin, underarms, chronic pelvic pain, increased weight or obesity, diabetes, lipid abnormalities and high blood pressure1. Fertility problems experienced by women with Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome may be related to the elevated hormone, insulin or glucose levels, all of which can interfere with implantation as well as development of the embryo1. Increased Leutenizing hormone reduces the chance of conception and increase miscarriage. Additionally abnormal insulin levels may also contribute to poor egg quality, making conception more difficult1. It is estimated the 50 - 60% of women who presented to the Osuki Ayurveda Centre for subfertility treatment were with Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome for the last 2 years. There is a special Ayurveda treatment regimen used in Osuki Ayurveda centre to cure Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome. Observing for nearly a period of two years of this treatment regimen, it is understood that this treatment regimen has a powerful effect for the management of Subfertility with Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome. But so far no scientific studies was carried out; hence the present study was carried out to scientifically evaluate the efficacy of this Ayurveda treatment regimen in subfertility with Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome.Material and Methods Preparation of drugs: All medicines were prepared by “Beem” chemicals under supervision of the principal author. Clinical study: In the present study, 40 patients of subfertility with Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome were selected from Osuki Ayurveda Centre, Rajagiriya, Sri Lanka. These patients were subjected to detailed clinical examination and investigations specially FSH, LH level and its ratio, Testosterone, FBS, Lipid profile, Liver function test and USG. Criteria for diagnosis: The presence of at least 3 of the following criteria: Polycystic Ovaries on USG Oligomenorrhea or anovulation Clinical or bio-chemical evidence of Hyperandrogenism Elevated LH LH: FSH ratio > 3 and 25 - 40 years age grouped subfertility patients were selected to the present study. The patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thyroid disorders, hyper prolactinemia, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, other gynaecological disorders, heart diseases and renal failure were excluded from the research. The male partners of selected couples had neither any abnormalities in Seminal Fluid Analysis nor any condition which leads subfertility. The treatment was conducted in 3 stages for duration of 6 months. In stage 1 (Day 1 to day 14) patients were treated with 30ml of Triphala Kwatha, 2 pills of Chandraprabha and 5g of powder of Manibhadra twice a day in the morning and evening at 6 PM. These drugs were administrated to do the basic body purification of the patients and also all these drugs are favourable to the function of the female genital organs2. In stage 2 (Day 15 to 4th month) patients were treated with 5g of each powder of Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus), Shatapushpa (Peucedanum graveloens) and Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia) twice a day in the morning and evening. Further they were treated with 20ml of Krishna Jeeraka, twice a day in the morning and evening. Shatavari is used to correct the hormonal influence and enhance the follicular maturity. Guduchi is used to increase the immunity (“Ojas”) of the patients. Shatapushpa act as a follicular maturity substance and as a pain relief agent. It also acts against menstrual irregularity34. In stage 3 (4th to 6th month) patients were treated with 5g of each powder of Atibala (Abutilon indicum) and Shatapushpa and 4 pills (each 125mg) of Rasayana Kalpa (A. racemosus, Terminalia chebula, T.belarica, Embelica officinalae, T. cordifolia, Naredostachys jatamansi, Herpestis monnieria) twice a day in the morning and evening at 6 PM4. Further they were treated with 20ml of oil of Sahachara twice a day in the morning and evening at 8 PM. These patients were locally treated with Uttara Vasti with 5ml of oil of Shatapushpa two consecutive days per month from the day which is completely cessation of the menstrual flow in between 4th to 10th day of the cycle. Atibala is used to correct the hormonal disturbances and facilitates to avoid miscarriages. Sahachara is used to remove unwanted follicles. The responses to the treatment were recorded and therapeutic effects were evaluated by symptomatic relief and through Ultrasonography and LH/ FSH hormones. Ultrasonography views the changes of the ovaries and the changes of the follicles regarding to the treatment. FSH/LH ratio is showing the reappearance of the hormonal levels to normal range. Pregnancy confirmed by using urine hCG test.Observation and Results These patients differ from each other in many ways such as physique, temperament and habits. In the present study all the patients were housewives and all they have no considerable stressful life style. They all suffered from primary subfertility and 90% of them have 4 to 6 years of marriage life. The 80% of patients were not using any contraceptive method while 10% used oral contraceptive pills and 5% used condom and natural methods, for the treatment of 6 months or less. All patients have not taken any kind of medicine within one year for PCOS and subfertility. They complained mostly irregular, few or absent menstruation, scanty or less menstrual blood, pain in menstruation, duration of menstruation below 3 days, excessive and increased body hair in face and chest, skin discolouration and obesity. Assessment criteria were based on the improvement in the score of cardinal symptoms which are irregular menstruation, duration of bleeding, dysmenorrhea, quantity of menstrual blood, excessive body hair, obesity, and skin discolouration before and after the treatment. The improvement in the cardinal symptoms were compared and analyzed statistically between the end of the treatment and baseline by using student's paired ‘t’ test. USG reports revealed, that reduce of polycystic appearance of ovaries and improvement of follicular maturity. LH/ FSH hormone reports revealed that the ratio came to the normal level.Assessment of amount of bleeding All the pads were collected and subjected to assessment of menstrual blood loss before during and after treatment. The method used by Vaishali Shinde (2004) in India was used for this study to measure the weight of pads. No. of pads were counted by using a pictorial chart, as used in previous studies by Higham in 1990 and Herve Ferdinandez in 2003. At the end of the aforesaid Ayurveda treatment regimen 85% of the patients were successfully get cured from Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome, while 75% of the patients get conceived.Discussion Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome is one of the main causes of subfertility in women. It is associated with anovulation, androgen excess, obesity and subfertility. PCOS results in increased free testosterone, ovarian androgen secretion, free estradiol and estrone. It's favouring LH secretion and steady state follicle stimulating hormone levels which effect on follicular maturation. This hyperandrogenic, normoestrogenic environment results in an anovulatory state, no progesterone is available to disrupt the constant estrogen stimulation of the endometrium15.Table 1 Duration of bleedingTable 2 Irregular MenstruationTable 3 Amount of bleeding & quantity of Menstrual bloodTable 3 (1) Quantity of Menstrual bloodTable 4 Pain during Menstrual periodTable 5 General weaknessTable 6 Prognosis of the cardinal symptomsTable 7 Overall effect of the therapy In allopathic medicine oral contraceptives, progestins, anti androgens and ovulation induction agents remain standard therapies. Aartava-kshaya, which can be correlated with PCOS has been described as deficiency or loss of artava, artava dose not appears in time or is delayed, is scanty and dose not last for three days. Pain in vagina also can be seen. According to Ayurveda, Aartava-kshaya is a disorder involving Pitta and Kapha doshas, Medas, Ambu/Rasa, Shukra/Artava Dhatu and Rasa, Rakta, Artava Vaha Srotas6. Therefore Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome can also be described with same involvement of Dosha, Dhatu and Upadhatu Kapha predominance manifests as increased weight, subfertility, hirsutium, diabetic tendencies and coldness. Pitta predominance manifests as hair loss, acne, painful menses, clots and heart problems. Vata predominance manifests with painful menses, scanty or less menstrual blood and severe menstrual irregularity678. The pathology is an obstruction in the pelvic cavity (Apana Kshetra) causing disorders in the flow of Vata. This in turn leads to an accumulation of Kapha and Pitta. The treatment principle is to clear obstruction in the pelvis, normalize metabolism and regulate the menstrual system (Aartava Dhatu). Kapha reducing, insulin enhancing and hormone rebalancing drugs help to the relieve symptoms of Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome. Triphala Kwatha, Chandraprabha Vati and Manibhadra Choorna help to clear obstruction and normalize the srotas. Especially Triphala and Guggulu are very useful for reducing excess weight2. Powder of A. racemosus brings balance and strength to the menstrual system and it helps to regulate Aartva Dhatu. Properties of Powder of seeds of P. graveloens, oil of Krishna Jeeraka (Nigella sativa) and oil of Sahachara (Barleria prionits) were helped to destroy cysts on ovaries and stimulate the follicular maturity. Properties of Deepana and Pachana of above drugs they elevate the Jatharagni, Dhatvagni as well as Aartavagni2. Powder of Guduchchadiya enhances the overall immunity and powder of Atibala has properties of Prajasthapana, Garbhasya DaurbalyAhara, Balya, Brunhana and Ojo Vardhana2. Therefore it helps to get conceived and avoid miscarriage35. Uttara Vasti is the most effective treatment in gynaecological disorders. It helps to purification and clears the Aartava Vaha Srotas, pacifies vitiated Apana Vayu8 and improve follicular maturity. Due to Samprapti Vighatana Kriya of this Ayurveda treatment regimen the symptoms of Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome get reduced. The effect of therapy show highly significant result on all above symptoms of Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome. When considering irregular menstruation most of the patients had 2 - 4 months duration. At the end of the treatment irregularity showed only 25% of the patients. At the end of the treatment 57.5% of patients had normal duration of menstrual bleeding, 75% of patients were relieved from Dysmenorrhea and majority of patients (70%) had average quantity of menstrual blood. When considering skin discolouration, 87.5% of patients were relieved from the symptom. At the end of the treatment, majority of patients (85%) had normal BMI levels. But when considering the symptom of excessive and increased body hair, there was no significant relief shown. In case of subfertility with Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome, 85% of patients were successfully get cured from Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome, while 75% of patients were conceived. All these patients were followed for the period of one year. During that period uncured patients were treated continuously. After the four month of duration 90% were cured. The pregnant mothers were treated with Prajasthapana drugs during their ante-natal visits to the clinic. All of them delivered healthy babies. At the end of this follow up period 85% from the treated group were conceived.Conclusion In conclusion, subfertility due to Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome can be cured successfully by using aforesaid Ayurveda treatment regimen.

Honda			58				The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of menopause on bone mineral density and bone width of the mandible. Results indicate that menopause affects the bone quality and quantity of the partially edentulous molar region of the mandible, which should be considered in dental implant treatment for postmenopausal women. The recovery of oral function with dental implant is clinically effective and highly predictable. Bone quantity and quality at the implant installation site affect its prognosis; however, the effects of menopause on jaw bone have not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of menopause on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone width of the mandible. The subjects were 72 female patients with a partially edentulous molar region of the mandible: 30 premenopausal and 42 postmenopausal women aged 30 to 70 years. Trabecular BMD was measured with quantitative computed tomography. Trabecular region width (TW) and cortical width (CW) were measured with CT. The BMD, TW, and CW of the two groups were compared. The trabecular BMD of postmenopausal women was lower than that of the premenopausal women. The TW of postmenopausal women was greater than that of premenopausal women, whereas the CW of postmenopausal women was significantly smaller than that of premenopausal women. In all these women, BMD correlated negatively with TW and positively with CW. In the premenopausal women, BMD negatively correlated with TW, but it did not correlate with CW. In the postmenopausal women, there was no correlation between BMD and bone width. These results indicate that menopause affects the bone quality and quantity of the partially edentulous molar region of the mandible, which should be considered in dental implant treatment for postmenopausal women.

Introduction Loss of posterior teeth may result in the loss of neuromuscular stability of the mandible, reduced masticatory efficiency, loss of vertical dimension of occlusion, and poor aesthetics. Prosthetic rehabilitation should aim at restoring the vertical dimension and increasing the occlusal contact area in the premolar/molar region. Dental implant treatment is an excellent option for prosthetic restoration that is associated with high success rates. Bone quantity and quality are very important for successful implant treatment. Of these two, a vital determinant for implant placement feasibility and the potential for bone grafting is bone quantity, which can now be determined more precisely by the various X-ray CT systems including helical CT and small radiation field CT and the wide variety of software available for image analyses and multiplanar reconstruction. Bone quality and cortical bone width, which are also important factors affecting primary implant stability and the duration of the non-loading period, have been classified by Lekholm et al. [1] and Misch [2], and their classification systems have been widely used in clinical practice. However, the practical and substantial assessment of bone quality often depends on the tactile impression while drilling to prepare the implant site and visual evaluation of X-ray CT and topographic images, which should be regarded as subjective procedures. Existing methods able to objectively assess bone quality depend on the cutting resistance experienced while preparing the implant site and the insertion torque during implant insertion. These are unable to provide a good preoperative understanding of bone quality and are sensitive to the procedures of implant surgery as well as implant geometry [3]. CT values obtained by X-ray scanning are another evaluation index of bone quality which, however, are not reliable in quantitative terms completely quantitative as CT values are influenced by the type of CT system used, tube voltages, algorithms, etc. In addition to the methods described above, a convenient and helpful method using panoramic radiography is available to assess the jaw bone, but it does not provide quantitative data. We have applied a quantitative computed tomography (QCT) method, which was developed by Genant et al. [4] and has been widely used in the lumbar vertebrae and femur for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, to the quantitative and objective assessment of jaw bone quality and reported the changes in mandibular bone quality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of menopause on mandibular bone quantity and quality in the edentulous molar region in patients receiving dental implant.Subjects and methods The present study was approved by the Dental Hospital at Tokyo Medical and Dental University Ethics Committee and the written informed consents were obtained from all the patients.Subjects The subjects were 72 Japanese women with a partially edentulous molar region of the mandible receiving dental implant at the Dental Hospital at Tokyo Medical and Dental University between 2005 and 2009. Thirty of these subjects were premenopausal and 42 were postmenopausal. They were aged from 40 to 78 years. Exclusion criteria were: impaired bone metabolism (such as hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, and oophorectomy, skeletal bone disorders) and the use of medications that affect bone metabolism (such as corticosteroids, estrogen preparation, bisphosphonate, and vitamin D).Bone mineral density and bone width measurement The trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) of the mandible was measured using single-energy QCT with a Siemens Somatom plus S (Siemens, Germany) at 120 kV and 125 mA with a slice thickness of 1 mm. The mandibular inferior border was placed vertical to the table with the mouth closed and set as the reference plane to perform CT scanning. The simultaneous scanning of a bone density calibration phantom containing two compartments with 0 and 200 mg/ml of calcium hydroxyapatite equivalent was performed when imaging in patients was done (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Simultaneous scanning of calibration phantom. The simultaneous scanning of bone density calibration phantom containing two compartments with 0 and 200 mg/ml of calcium hydroxyapatite equivalent was performed when CT scanning in patients was done Among all the CT images obtained, the sliced image containing the mental foramen parallel to the mandibular inferior border was selected for the measurement (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Image selection for measurements. The sliced images containing the mental foramen parallel to the lower border of the mandible were selected The edentulous region in the abovementioned image was set as the region of interest (ROI) to determine the average CT values of the trabecular bone in the edentulous molar region. The regions where the CT values were <500 HU were regarded as trabecular bone regions. Those parts presenting with localized bone sclerosis within the image of the trabecular bone region were excluded from CT value measurement. The areas adjacent to the interface between cortical and trabecular bone were also excluded from the ROI to eliminate the partial volume effect. The CT values measured within the ROI (3 × 3 mm) three times were averaged to obtain mean CT values for individual trabecular bone regions. These mean CT values and the CT values obtained with the calibration phantom were converted based on the linear relationship between the X-ray attenuation coefficients and the CT values to calculate the values of bone mineral density (in milligrams per milliliter: BMD). Additionally, for the edentulous molar region in the same sliced image (bone mode), the widths of the trabecular bone region (TW) as well as the width of the cortical bone (CW) including those in both the buccal and lingual layers of the cortex sides were determined using the distance measurement software provided with the CT scanner (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 Bone width measurementsStatistical analysis The following three analyses were performed using the measurements of the bone widths and the calculated BMD values: The comparison of the BMD values and the bone widths between pre- and postmenopause The correlations between BMD and bone width The Wilcoxon test was used to verify possible differences between two groups and the correlations were determined using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was accepted at the P < 0.005 level.ResultsComparison of the BMD values and bone widths between pre- and postmenopausal women Table 1 shows the values of BMD and bone widths of premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The BMD values of postmenopausal women were significantly lower. Significantly higher TW values and lower CW values were observed in postmenopausal women. Thus, the results suggest a reduced percentage of cortical bone in the mandible of postmenopausal women.

[5], photodensitometry using intraoral radiography, and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [6, 7]. These modalities have been used in several previous studies. QCT used in this study determines bone quantity using a three-dimensional measurement method by means of X-ray CT. This has several advantages over other measurement methods including the individual measurement of trabecular and cortical bone and the possible determination of bone density per volume (in milligrams per milliliter), and thus it may be the measurement method of choice for the jaw bone, given its complex and uneven structure. However, the QCT method has the disadvantages of relatively high exposure dose compared to that required for other radiography methods and its poor reproducibility due to high sensitivity to patient positioning and ROI setting. However, these disadvantages can be virtually eliminated as only a single exposure is required when applying the QCT method to preoperative assessment for implant surgery. By a single scan with the additional operation of simply mounting the ready-made calibration phantom onto the head, the QCT method can provide quantitative bone quality measurements of both cortical and trabecular as well as information including bone morphology and quantity at the planned implant site. Thus, it is an extremely helpful modality for preoperative examination prior to implant. Furthermore, as the jaw bone can be affected by retained teeth and local impacts including mechanical stimulation caused by occlusion, careful consideration should be given to the measurement site within the jaw to be set. Therefore, patients with a posterior free end missing were included in this study to minimize the possible effects of such factors.Influences of menopause on mandibular bone In the studies of the influences of menopause on all the bones of the body by Ito et al. [8], Kroger et al. [9], and Kin et al. [10], the evident loss of bone mass and BMD after menopause have been reported for lumbar vertebral bodies and the femur. Irie et al. [11] investigated the effect of menopause on mandibular bone by examining three-dimensional morphological changes in the mandibular bone of ovariectomized rats using micro CT and reported that not only significantly decreased values for both bone mass and width of trabecular bone but also significantly increased distances between trabeculae were observed in ovariectomized rats compared to controls. Kuroda et al. [12] also performed a similar study using DXA and pQCT methods and reported a significantly decreased trabecular bone density in the posterior region of the mandible in the ovariectomized rats compared to controls while no difference was observed for the cortical bone density in the same region. Furthermore, Kurosu et al. [13] investigated the correlation between the bone density of lumbar vertebrae determined by DXA examination and that of mandibular bone measured using QCT in 30 postmenopausal women with teeth and reported that a positive correlation existed between the bone density of lumbar vertebrae and the trabecular bone density of mandibular bone. Meanwhile, Klemetti et al. [14] conducted a similar study in 71 postmenopausal women with edentulous or partially edentulous jaws using QCT and reported that there was no correlation between the bone density of the lumbar vertebrae and density of trabecular bone in the mandible, but a correlation with mandibular cortical bone density existed. In addition, the results of the study by Taguchi et al. [15] using QCT were consistent with Klemetti’s findings. In this study, the BMD values for mandibular trabecular bone in the edentulous region were significantly lower in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women. The disagreement between our results and those of Klemetti et al. [14] and Taguchi et al. [15] may be attributed to the different patient histories from those in the studies of them as half of the patients that are included in our study had only a small edentulous span with three or fewer missing teeth. Thus, the possible contribution of occlusal forces derived from adjacent teeth to such results was suggested. However, in this study, the influences of other factors including the number of residual teeth, age, and the number of years after menopause were not taken into consideration and should be adequately investigated in the future. Moreover, our study revealed that a significantly large proportion of the edentulous region of the mandible consisted of trabecular bone while the proportion occupied by cortical bone was significantly small. Taguchi et al. [16] reported a significant correlation between the bone density of lumbar vertebrae and cortical thickness and the morphology of the mandibular lower border, a finding which supports the results from our study together with the above-described results of Irie et al. [11]. Therefore, in the mandible where teeth are lost, the bone density may be reduced and the loss of trabecular bone density as well as cortical bone resorption from the inside can advance with menopause just as they do in bones in other parts of the body.Relationships between bone quality and quantity Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to enhanced bone fragility and an increase in fracture risk [17]. This bone fragility involves both bone quantity and quality; specifically, it results from thinning of the cortical bone and cavity expansion due to bone absorption at the endosteum surface as well as reduced bone density. Regarding osteoporosis of the mandible, Tamai et al. [18] investigated mandibular bone quality using QCT in healthy subjects and reported that the BMDs of mandibular cortical and cancellous bone reached a peak when subjects were in their 30s and 40s and then began to decline. Takaishi et al. [19] also reported that mandibular alveolar bone mineral density diminishes with age. With regard to bone quantity, Von Wowern et al. [20] reported that in the mandible, the cortical bone mass diminishes with age. On the other hand, Kribbs et al. [21] showed that diminution of the mandibular mass is not correlated with age. From our study results, the BMD of trabecular bone correlated negatively with trabecular bone width and positively with cortical bone width and such tendency was more distinctly observed in women. Therefore, these findings indicate that the reduced bone strength in the mandible develops with age just as in the other bones in the body, caused by age-associated BMD loss of mandibular trabecular bone accompanying increased trabecular bone mass and reduced cortical bone mass. It would also appear that trabecular bone quality reflects bone quantity in the same area.New classifications of jaw bone for implant treatment For predictable implant treatment, a number of patient-related factors need to be understood. These include systemic conditions such as a history of diabetes, etc., oral hygiene, periodontal condition, smoking habit, jaw bone quality and quantity, occlusion patterns, and parafunctional habits. As bone quality is a crucial factor for the successful achievement of osseointegration, systems for its classification have been developed by Lekholm et al. [1] and Misch [2], and based on their classification, many studies and case reports have been published to date. However, classification based on visual assessment of radiographic images is associated with several problems including imaging stability, which is affected by the tube voltage and current of the X-ray unit and degradation of the developing fluid. Moreover, assessment based on the tactile sensation during implant site preparation has been questioned due to poor objectivity as reported in the study by Trisi et al. [22]. Clinically, cortical bone thickness significantly affects implant primary stability compared to the trabecular bone. Thus, we measured the thickness of cortical bone and BMD and classified jaw bone for implant treatment (Table 2). Two patients of all participants, who experienced loose implants or early bone resorption during the non-loading period after implant insertion, were both premenopausal women whose bone quality was classified into A with high BMD values. Therefore, these failures may be attributable to heat-induced injury during implant site preparation and placement. Thus, we can conclude that these results have demonstrated the usefulness of the quantitative measurement of bone density for implant treatment and the utility of new bone classification based on such measurements. Table 2 Classification of mandibular bone for implant treatmentClassABCDEPremenoposal women (30cases)721020Postmenoposal women (42cases)01015125Thickness of cortical bone (mm)>3.53.5>, >13.5>, >11>1>BMD (mg/ml)>300300>, >8080>300>, >8080> Class A thick cortical bone and limited medullary cavity (or much trabecular bone); class B thick cortical bone but medullary cavity (or less trabecular bone); class C thin cortical bone but limited medullary cavity (or much trabecular bone); class D thin cortical bone and medullary cavity (or less trabecular bone); class E thin cortical bone and medullary cavity (or less trabecular bone) Our classification using QCT may have applications beyond implant treatment planning based on the preoperative objective assessment of bone quality. It may also be possible to use it for inter-patient comparison and the evaluation of grafted bone. The correlation between our classification and factors including cutting resistance and removal torque should be further investigated to improve its clinical utility.

Introduction The revolution in biological knowledge in the past two decades, with the ability to manipulate, sequence, clone and transfect DNA, has resulted in the sequencing of multiple prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, and has spawned a whole new industry, the biotechnology industry – now a major segment of the pharmaceutical industry. This has led to the development of important new drugs, such as cytokines, as well as monoclonal antibodies and receptor Fc fusion proteins. In this chapter, we will present evidence, using tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α as our example, that gene regulation is complex and varies depending on the cell type, as well as the signal eliciting gene activation. Analysis of gene regulation is typically performed in transformed cell lines with, for example, footprinting analysis and DNase protection to evaluate which portions of DNA are 'protected' by transcription factors. With genes induced by multiple signals, such as TNF-α, however, it is not clear whether every signal operates in the same way in every cell. Prior literature suggested they did not, since in human T-cell lines (JURKAT), TNF-α synthesis was nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT)-dependent and NF-κB-independent, whereas in murine macrophages it was NF-κB dependent [1]. Hence, while a useful indicator, knowledge of the sites in the promoter for transcription factors would not have yielded any definitive data pertaining to a given circumstance. We will also present evidence that there are new approaches of high-efficiency gene delivery that do permit the elucidation of gene function in physiological and pathological circumstances. The technique we have developed employs replication-deficient adenoviruses, but other efficient delivery systems can also be equally valuable for defining gene function. However, their utility may depend on the particular cell system being investigated.The problem of gene delivery Certain molecular techniques, while yielding new information, have limitations. DNA transfer by transfection has low efficiency in easily transfectable transformed cell lines (e.g. HEK 293, COS, CHO), but almost no efficiency in normal 'primary' cells. Low-efficiency DNA transfection need not be a rate-limiting step, as cells stably transfected with DNA can be detected, sorted or cloned. However, there are problems that cannot be overcome. One problem is that transfectable cells from certain lineages such as macrophages, a cell type of major importance in inflammation and chronic rheumatoid diseases, are specialised to degrade exogenous material (such as DNA) and consequently do not transfect. Gene function in one cell type may not be identical to that in another; hence, conclusions made in transfectable cell lineages may not extrapolate to other nontransfectable cells. Furthermore, transformed cell lines have enormous abnormalities in their genomes, with deletions, duplications and alterations in chromosome number. We therefore explored methods of DNA delivery to nontransformed cells, both normal and cells from pathological sites, that yield effective DNA transfer into >90% of cells. This level of transfer would permit the inhibition of signalling pathways by the inserted DNA. This DNA may encode an endogenous inhibitor (e.g. inhibitor of kappa B alpha [IκBα], which binds NF-κB), a dominant negative (i.e. blocks normal or 'wild type' product), mutation of a kinase or transcription factor, a DNA encoding an antisense mRNA, or even a DNA encoding a single-chain antibody variable region.Methods of DNA delivery Current gene delivery systems can be broadly categorised into two main groups: nonviral (plasmid DNA, DNA-coated gold particles, liposomes and polymer DNA complexes), and viral vectors (adenovirus, retrovirus, adeno-associated virus, lenti-virus and herpes virus).Nonviral vectors Nonviral vectors attract considerable interest as they lack some of the risks inherent with viral vectors. Nonviral DNA delivery is less toxic, less immunogenic, and easier to prepare. However, DNA delivery is significantly less efficient and gene expression only occurs over a short duration, posing serious limitations and opportunities for the use of these systems for long-term treatment of rheumatic and other diseases. In addition, inflammatory responses following in vivo delivery of DNA and lipid–DNA complexes have been reported [2-4]. The exact mechanism is currently unknown, but might be related to the presence of unmethylated CpG motifs in plasmid DNA propagated in bacteria.Naked or plasmid DNA DNA can be directly administered to skeletal muscle via an intramuscular injection of 'naked' plasmid DNA. However, gene expression was restricted to cells nearest the route of injection, and less than 1% of the plasmid DNA was incorporated into the cells [5]. Systemic administration has been even less successful. Intravenous injection of naked plasmid DNA showed no gene expression, even in the liver, where the highest uptake was observed [6]. Liu et al. have more recently shown that it is possible to achieve systemic administration of naked DNA under hydrostatic pressure by injecting a large volume of DNA solution via the tail vein of mice [7]. Although these experiments demonstrate that it may be possible to deliver naked DNA to cells, this is not a feasible option for exploring gene function.Gene gun Particle-mediated ('gene gun') gene transfer has been applied to various cells and tissues. Gold particles coated with plasmid DNA are propelled at the target tissue at pressures of 150–200 psi. The efficiency of this system varies, with skin cells showing the greatest uptake of 10–20% [8]. This system has been used to deliver a nucleic acid-based hepatitis B vaccine to both mice and humans, and is presently in clinical trials [9]. The major limitations are the shallow penetration of particles, associated cell damage, and the inability to deliver the DNA systemically.Cationic lipids and polymers Cationic lipids, such as cationic derivatives of cholesterol and diacylglycerol, quarternary ammonium detergents, and lipid derivatives of polyamines condense plasmid DNA to form particles based on the electrostatic interaction and to protect it from degradation. Mahato et al. reported clearance of liposome plasmid DNA from the circulation within 60 min, resulting in extensive accumulation in the lung and liver after intravenous injection in mice [6]. DNA complex properties, such as molecular weight, particle size, and electrical charge, are important considerations for biodistribution of carriers after intravenous injection. The development of carrier systems that escape undesired tissue uptake and exhibit target cell-specificity is therefore required to make this a viable in vivo system [10]. Although this method improves the ability of DNA to evade swift degradation, delivery to target cells is still elusive and expression of the transgene is short lived. Cationic polymers (amino acids) are soluble in water, are biodegradable, are not significantly immunogenic, and have multiple functional groups that can be chemically modified. These cationic polymers are also more effective at condensing DNA than cationic lipids. Among various poly(amino acids) available, poly(glutamic acid) and poly(lysine) have been widely used as carrier backbones.Viral vectors Since the evolution and survival of viruses is based on their ability to infect cells and to replicate their genes, it is not surprising that viral vectors have proven to be the most efficient vehicles for DNA delivery to cells both in vitro and in vivo. Viruses also permit greater duration of transgene expression. This is particularly relevant when attempting to treat chronic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, cystic fibrosis, or muscular dystrophy, where enduring transgene expression is desirable. Viral vectors are capable of delivering exogenous cDNA to the synovium, enabling effective levels of intra-articular transgene expression following direct injection to the joint. The expression of certain gene products has proven to be sufficient to inhibit the progression of disease in animals with experimental arthritis, even when the virus is administered after onset of inflammation (see later).Adeno-associated virus Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a single-stranded DNA parvovirus that causes no known pathology in humans. AAV infection involves attachment to a variety of cell surface receptors (heparan sulfate, integrins, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) followed by clathrin-dependent or clathrin-independent internalisation [11]. Although the wild-type AAV integrates into a specific locus (AAVS1) on the human chromosome 19, recombinant AAV vectors do not because they lack the rep gene. Consequently, gene expression is transient [12]. Transgenes of up to 5 kb can be accommodated within the 4.68 kb single-stranded DNA virus, and AAV infects a wide variety of dividing and nondividing cells. Recombinant AAV encodes no viral proteins, reducing its immunogenicity and capacity to stimulate an inflammatory response. Two different groups have recently shown that AAV encoding IL-4 promotes long-term (up to 7 months) protection from articular cartilage destruction and amelioration of disease severity in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) [13,14]. Additionally, intra-articular injection of AAV encoding soluble TNF receptor I significantly decreased synovial hyperplasia, and cartilage and bone destruction, in TNF-α transgenic mice [15].Herpes simplex viruses The herpes simplex virus (HSV) offers several potential benefits that could be useful for treating arthritic conditions. More than one-half of the 152 kb genome of HSV is not required for replication in vitro, and large genes or multiple genes can therefore be accommodated by this vector. HSV also develops latency in certain cell types, where the viral genome persists for the life of the host cell without integrating into the genome and without altering host cell metabolism. Although most of the immediate-early genes are inactivated, HSV vectors still express low levels of some viral proteins, resulting in an inflammatory response [16]. Administration of HSV-derived vectors as DNA–liposome complexes improves in vivo transduction efficiency by evading the host anti-HSV immunity during systemic administration [15,17]. The delivery of a HSV vector encoding human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) to the joints of rabbits with experimental arthritis has been shown to ameliorate inflammation [18].Retroviruses Retroviruses derived from the Moloney murine leukaemia virus have been used extensively in the laboratory and in clinical trials. They are able to incorporate 8–10 kb exogenous DNA, and they contain no native viral coding sequences. Retroviruses integrate their genome into that of the host cell, resulting in sustained transgene expression. This feature of retroviruses also presents a potential hazard beccause insertional mutagenesis could occur following random integration of the provirus into the host genome. This vector is currently used to treat the rare lethal immune disorder, severe combined immunodeficiency-X1, in children [19]. Successful application of these vectors for the study of gene function and gene therapy, however, has often proven difficult because they are unable to transduce quiescent cells [20]. Immortalised embryonic DBA/1 fibroblasts, infected with a retrovirus expressing murine IFN-β ex vivo and subsequently implanted intraperitoneally into mice immunised with bovine type II collagen, were able to prevent the onset of arthritis or to ameliorate existing disease [21]. Recent work by Croxford et al. has shown that fibroblasts, transduced with retroviral vectors expressing IL-10, could inhibit experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, which is a central nervous system autoimmune disease mediated by the action of CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and proinflammatory cytokines [22]. Transgene expression, similar to that observed with ex vivo administration, has been achieved using direct administration of high-titre retroviruses into the arthritic joint [23,24]. However, high-titre preparations of Moloney murine leukaemia virus-based vectors have been difficult to generate routinely, and this has limited studies involving direct retroviral-mediated gene delivery. The only clinical trial on gene therapy of RA involving nine patients was performed in the USA using a retroviral vector containing the cDNA for IL-1Ra. Synovial tissue was removed by joint surgery, and cells were expanded and infected in vitro before being re-introduced into the joint space. Synovial tissue was removed 1 week later by joint arthroplasty for analysis, showing evidence of IL-1Ra expression at both mRNA and protein levels. This study of local ex vivo retroviral gene therapy of RA demonstrated that safe and effective transgene expression could be achieved [25].Adenoviruses The remainder of this review will focus on the development and use of adenoviruses in vitro and in vivo. Replication-deficient adenoviruses are one of the most widely used systems for preclinical experimentation owing to their efficiency and technically straightforward methods for generating high-titre recombinant adenoviruses [26,27]. Adenoviral particles are ~70–100 nm non-enveloped icosahedrons that contain a ~35 kb double-stranded DNA genome and can infect a wide range of cell types. Adenoviruses are endocytosed by attachment of their fibre protein to the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) [28]. This process is facilitated by interactions between the penton base protein and integrins on the cell surface. This latter interaction induces release of the fibre protein and initiates internalisation of bound virions into early endosomes via clathrin-coated pits. After internalisation and endosomal escape, adenovirus particles undergo a stepwise disassembly programme and, finally, delivery of viral DNA to the nucleus. This viral DNA exists as extra-chromosomal DNA, resulting in transient gene expression (Fig. 1). The first generation of adenoviruses commonly used for preclinical research are devoid of the E1, E3 regions of the viral genome (Fig. 2). This prevents virus replication while providing the space required to insert your gene of interest. The ability of adenoviruses to infect nearly 100% of cells, quiescent and dividing, makes it an extremely useful vehicle for gene delivery.Figure 1 Schematic representation of the adenoviral attachment and internalisation. CAR, Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor.Figure 2 Schematic diagram of the adenoviral genome. In the first generation of adenoviral vectors, the E1A, E1B and E3 regions have been deleted to allow for insertion of your gene of interest. CMV, cytomegalovirus.Heterogeneity of gene regulation: dependent on cell type and signals Adenoviruses have been used to analyse macrophages (monocytes differentiated for 2 days with macrophage colony stimulating factor) stimulated to produce TNF-α by a range of signals. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), UV light, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were shown to be NF-κB dependent, while zymosan and anti-CD45 were NF-κB independent, demonstrating that within a single cell type the stimulus determined the signalling pathway [29]. Again there were differences in T-cell-dependent stimulation of macrophage TNF-α production, with T-cell receptor-activated T cells showing NF-κB-independent TNF-α production whereas bystander cytokine-activated T cells were driving NF-κB-dependent TNF-α [30]. The production of TNF-α in antigen-activated T cells was different from that in macrophages because in cell lines it appeared to be NF-κB independent. A variety of cytokines and cytokine inhibitors produced by macrophages have been tested for their dependence on NF-κB using the IκBα adenovirus. It appears that NF-κB regulates essentially all proinflammatory cytokines, although not with every stimulus. Second, NF-κB does not regulate anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, IL-11 or IL-1Ra, but has moderate effects on shedding of soluble TNF receptor. Third, there were differences within a single study (e.g. LPS) in the degree to which different proinflammatory cytokines were NF-κB dependent. IL-6 was ~80% inhibited, whereas TNF and IL-1 were 60% inhibited and IL-8 was only inhibited by 30–40%. The results varied with different stimuli; for example, with TNF-α stimulation, IL-8 is >60% NF-κB dependent. The reasons for these differences are not known. However, it is possible that other transcription factors are used for IL-1 and IL-8 production in response to LPS [31]. Work by Pope et al. has shown that PMA-treated macrophages, infected with a dominant negative CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) adenovirus, produce 60% less TNF-α in response to LPS. Furthermore, dominant negative versions of both C/EBPβ and c-Jun, but not NF-κB p65, suppressed PMA-induced TNF-α secretion, demonstrating that C/EBPβ and c-Jun contribute to TNF-α regulation in normal macrophages [32]. The importance of using the appropriate model for studying gene regulation, and thereby identify potential targets for therapy, has been aptly demonstrated by studies on the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). This enzyme was identified as kinase for IKK1/α, a part of the IκB kinase (IKK) signalosome. Several studies on NIK have shown evidence that NIK acts as a gateway for multiple activators of NF-κB, including the key inflammatory factors, TNF-α, IL-1 and LPS. However, these studies have been exclusively performed in transformed cell lines [33-35]. We confirmed these results in cell lines using an adenovirus encoding a dominant negative version of NIK. However, introduction of the same construct into primary human cells of fibroblast, myeloid or endothelial lineage showed no role for NIK in TNF-α, LPS or IL-1 signalling (Figs 3 and 4) [36]. Rather, the role of NIK was restricted to NF-κB induction by activation of the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) (Fig. 4) [36]. This supported studies in cells from mice defective in NIK expression or function that showed that NIK function was restricted to LTβR signalling [37]. Together, these data highlight the diversity inherent in signalling pathways and the potent effect that transformation has on cell function.Figure 3 Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent gene induction in HeLa 57A cells is NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) dependent. HeLa 57A cells were infected with Adv.GFP, Adv.IκBα, or Adv.NIK-kd as indicated (moi 50) and left for 24 hours to allow transgene expression. Cells were stimulated for 4 hours with vehicle (no shading), with 25 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (solid shading), or with 10 ng/ml IL-1α (hashed shading). Cell lysates were then prepared and luciferase activities assessed (n = 3, ± SEM). (b, c) NIK is not required for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced or TNF-α-induced cytokine expression in primary human macrophages. Primary human macrophage colony stimulating factor-differentiated macrophages were infected with Adv.GFP or Adv.NIK-kd as indicated (moi 100) and left for 24 hours to allow transgene expression. Cells were then stimulated for a further 24 hours with vehicle (no shading), with 10 ng/ml LPS (hashed shading), or with 25 ng/ml TNF-α (solid shading). Cell supernatants were collected and secreted IL-6 and TNF-α levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunopsorbent assay (n = 3, ± SEM).Figure 4 Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-inducing kinase (NIK) is dispensable for tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor but is essential for lymphotoxin beta-receptor (LTβR)-induced NF-κB activation in primary human skin fibroblasts. Primary human skin fibroblasts were infected with Adv.GFP, Adv.NIK-kd, Adv.IKK2-kd or Adv.IκBα (moi 50) and left for 24 hours to allow transgene expression. (a) Cells were stimulated with vehicle (control), with 25 ng/ml TNF-α or with 50 ng/ml LTα1β2 for 30 min prior to the preparation of cytosolic and nuclear extracts. Cytosolic IκBα levels were determined by western blotting (upper panel). Nuclear NF-κB DNA-binding activities were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (lower panel). (b) Cells were stimulated with vehicle (control), with 25 ng/ml TNF-α or with 50 ng/ml LTα1β2 for 24 hours, and secreted IL-6 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (n = 3, ± SEM).Use of adenoviruses for analysis of RA and its modelsIn vitro analysis on synovial tissue As the pathology of RA is concentrated in the synovium, analysis of this tissue can provide major insights into its pathogenesis. A key question was therefore whether adenoviruses could effectively infect human synovial cells in vitro and, if so, whether all cell types infect equally. It was found that >90% of synovial cells were infected at a multiplicity of virus of 40:1 using a β-galactosidase reporter virus (Fig. 5) [31]. Furthermore, it was established by flow cytometry that all subpopulations of cells were infected; macrophages, fibroblasts and also >80% of T cells. The surprising result indicated that cells from pathological sites are easier to infect than resting cells, probably due to their prior exposure to cytokines. This observation enabled us, in parallel with others, to evaluate the role of various signalling molecules in rheumatoid synovium.Figure 5 Efficiency of infection of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) joint cell cultures. RA joint tissues were obtained from the synovium from patients with RA undergoing surgery. Cells were infected with Advβgal (moi 40) for 48 hours prior to analysis of the cells for βgal expression by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). (B) Effect of IκBα transgene expression on cytokine expression in RA joint cell cultures. RA joint cells were infected with AdvIκBα or AdvO (moi 40). Culture supernatants were harvested after 48 hours and analysed for the expression of various cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data are representative of samples from at least five patients. IL-1RA, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist; TNF, tumour necrosis factor; sTNFR, soluble TNF receptor. With the IκBα adenovirus, we showed that multiple proinflammatory cytokines are downregulated: TNF-α by 70%, IL-6 by 80%, and IL-1 by ~50% (as shown in Fig. 5). In contrast, anti-inflammatory mediators were not affected. These results parallel prior studies with macrophages. The variable degree of inhibition indicates that, while NF-κB is of major importance, other important transcription factors are involved, especially for IL-1 and IL-8. The blockage of NF-κB resulted in the downregulation of degradative enzymes, with matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP-3 markedly reduced. In contrast, the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, TIMP-1, was not downregulated [38]. Taken together, the local effects of NF-κB blockade would be very beneficial for RA. Much work has been carried out to define the inducers of NF-κB and to subsequently generate inhibitors (e.g. inhibitors of IKK2). Adenoviral-mediated gene delivery of a non-degradable IκBα, or dominant negative versions of C/EBPβ or c-Jun, has been examined to determine the contribution of each transcription factor to IL-6 and IL-8 expression by RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Inhibition of NF-κB activation significantly reduced the spontaneous and IL-1β-induced secretion of IL-6 and IL-8. Conversely, inhibition of C/EBPβ and c-Jun/AP-1 had little or no effect on the production of either IL-6 or IL-8 [39]. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is an important regulator of cytokine production, including TNF-α. While drugs blocking p38 MAPK (e.g. SB203570) were effective at blocking LPS-induced TNF-α, they were less effective at blocking spontaneous synovial TNF-α production. Specific p38 MAPK inhibitors, encoded in adenoviral constructs, were constructed to examine their effectiveness in rheumatoid synovial cultures. It was found that up to 80% of spontaneously produced TNF-α was inhibited (Ciesielski et al., manuscript in preparation).In vivo effects on animal models of arthritis Adenoviral vectors have been extensively used in preclinical studies on gene therapy of RA using a number of animal models of arthritis. Two main strategies have been employed: systemic delivery, whereby vectors are injected intravenously; and local delivery, whereby genes are transferred to the joint, either via direct injection into the joint (in vivo), or by infecting autologous synovial cells in vitro and transferring the transformed cells into the joint (ex vivo). Modulation and suppression of experimental arthritis has been achieved by the systemic gene delivery of a variety of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive proteins. Sustained amelioration of murine CIA was demonstrated in our studies. An adenovirus encoding IL-10, when injected intravenously, produced elevated serum levels of murine IL-10 that reduced cell-mediated immune reactivity and IFN-γ production without affecting antibody responses. Interestingly, IL-10 was also able to suppress adenovirus-induced hepatic inflammation, a limitation of the first-generation adenoviral vectors [40]. Systemic delivery of an adenovirus encoding the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen CTLA4-Ig, an inhibitor of the CD28/CD80 and CD86 interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, has also been investigated by our group. This treatment was similarly very effective, even if administered after onset of arthritis, being just as effective as protein delivery in optimal concentrations [41]. With the systemic injection of an adenovirus encoding an immunogenic protein, strikingly different results were obtained. The human p55 TNF receptor coupled to a mouse IgG Fc fusion protein gene, inserted into an adenoviral vector and injected systemically in arthritic mice, induced elevated serum levels of the fusion protein and ameliorated CIA for up to 7–10 days. Then, a dramatic inflammatory rebound was observed and treated mice appeared sicker than controls. These findings confirm prior reports on the role of host immune reactions elicited more towards the product of gene transduction than to the virus itself. The group of Robbins and Evans has reported successful treatment of murine CIA with an adenovirus encoding IL-4 [42]. This treatment was also effective in the rat model of adjuvant arthritis after disease onset, and decreased levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and CCL5 (the chemokine ligand for CCR5) were reported [43]. A local intra-articular approach has also been investigated using adenoviral vectors. As mutations in the tumour suppressor protein p53 are observed in synovial cells from some RA patients, overexpression of p53 by adenoviral gene transfer in synovial cell cultures in vitro, and in synovial tissue in vivo, has been achieved in a rabbit model of arthritis, and resulted in significant apoptosis. In addition, the intra-articular injection of p53 adenovirus determined a rapid induction of synovial apoptosis in the rabbit knee joint without affecting cartilage metabolism [44]. Makorov et al. have shown in a rat model of arthritis that local injection of a retrovirus expressing a mutant, non-degradable IκBα, induces improvements in joint disease [45]. This work is supported by experiments using another member of the NF-κB pathway; inhibitor of NF-κB kinase beta (IKKβ). Intra-articular injection of adenovirus encoding IKKβ-wt into the joints of normal rats caused significant paw swelling and histologic evidence of synovial inflammation. Increased IKK activity was detectable in the IKKβ-wt-injected ankle joints, coincident with enhanced NF-κB DNA binding activity, while a dominant negative version of IKKβ significantly ameliorated disease severity of adjuvant arthritis, and determined a significant decrease in NF-κB DNA expression [46]. The work described here regarding animal models of arthritis has been supplemented by a number of studies using retroviruses that were used to infect cell lines in vitro and then injected systemically in vivo[47].Future prospects The working draft covering 97% of the human genome was completed in June 2000. It is expected that the 'finished' sequence of greater than 99.99% accuracy will be completed within the next year. Analysis of the current sequence shows 38,000 predicted genes and many of these have no known function. Expectations within the pharmaceutical industry have been high that this knowledge will be transformed into therapeutic targets and new drugs. These expectations have so far not been met because crucial roadblocks remain in the elucidation of target genes for drug development. Expectations have been raised about the possibility of performing drug development 'in silico' using genetic information, but successes from this approach remain to be achieved. The ability to explore gene function both in vitro and in vivo is paramount to the elucidation of gene regulation and potential targets for therapeutic intervention. While substantial work has been undertaken to determine the signalling pathways controlling TNF-α production and other inflammatory mediators, the roles of a multitude of cytokines, cytokine receptors, kinases and phosphatases remain to be explored. Research into developing high-efficiency vectors for transgene delivery is a continually evolving field of research. Current research into developing cationic lipids/polymers for cell-specific delivery via receptor-mediated endocytosis, such as galactose, mannose, lactose, transferrin, epidermal growth factor, asialoglycoprotein and antibodies, may provide valuable advances allowing the targeting of specific cell populations [10]. Combining advances in DNA delivery via directed cationic lipids and polymers, and improved adenoviral or other viral vectors, looks to be a promising approach to evade clearance and to deliver stable gene expression to specific cells [48,49]. Although adenoviruses have proved valuable tools for preclinical research, the first generation of E1, E3 deleted vectors still contains native viral-coding sequences expressed at low levels, resulting in inflammatory responses (Fig. 2) [50]. Furthermore, expression of these viral proteins leads to the clearance of transduced cells, limiting transgene expression [51]. Recently described helper-dependent, or gutless, adenoviral vectors may overcome many of these problems. These adenoviruses do not encode any viral coding sequences and have shown an excellent expression profile in a variety of animal models, as well as reduced toxicity after local or systemic delivery [52]. Expression of the transgene can be detected for many months and the gutted adenoviruses do not elicit an immune response in animals previously immunised against the same adenovirus serotype [53].Concluding remarks There has been much progress in the development of methods of gene transfer into normal cells and cells from pathological sites. These techniques can be used to test the function of genes, allegedly known or unknown both in vivo and in vitro. These approaches can be used to elucidate important pathways, and to help confirm or define therapeutic targets.Glossary of terms AAV = adeno-associated virus; C/EBPβ = CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta; HSV = herpes simplex virus; IKK = IκB kinase; IKKβ = inhibitor of NF-κB kinase beta; IL-1Ra = interleukin-1 receptor antagonist; LTβR = lymphotoxin beta-receptor; NIK = NF-κB-inducing kinase.

Centella coriacea Nannfd., Hydrocotyle asiatica L., Hydrocotyle lunata Lam., and Trisanthus cochinchinensis Lour.) is a tropical medicinal plant from Apiaceae family native to Southeast Asian countries such as India, Sri Lanka, China, Indonesia, and Malaysia as well as South Africa and Madagascar [1]. C. asiatica, commonly known as “Gotu kola, Asiatic pennywort, Indian pennywort, Indian water navelwort, wild violet, and tiger herb” in English, is a tropical plant, which has been also cultivated successfully due to its medical importance in some countries including Turkey, and it has a long history of utilization in ayurvedic and Chinese traditional medicines since centuries [2]. The leaves, which are edible, are in yellowish-green color, thin, alternate with long petioles, and quite characteristic reniform, orbicular, or oblong-elliptic shapes with seven veins [3] (Figure 1). The plant grows horizontally through its green to red stolones which combine to each other and roots in underground. Monographs of the plant describing mainly its wound healing and memory enhancement effects exist in the European Pharmacopeia, Commission E of the German Ministry of Health, and World Health Organization (WHO) [4]. In addition to neuroprotective effect of C. asiatica, it has been reported to own a wide range of biological activities desired for human health such as wound healing [5–7], anti-inflammatory [8, 9], antipsoriatic [10], antiulcer [11, 12], hepatoprotective [13], anticonvulsant [14], sedative [15], immunostimulant [16], cardioprotective [17, 18], antidiabetic [19], cytotoxic and antitumor [20, 21], antiviral [22], antibacterial [23], insecticidal [24], antifungal [25], antioxidant [26–28], and for lepra [29] and venous deficiency treatments [30, 31]. Numerous preparations of this plant in various pharmaceutical forms recommended for several indications including neurological disorders are available allover the world. Taking this fact into consideration, many researchers have focused on neuroprotective effect of C. asiatica in order to confirm its traditional use on scientific base. For this purpose, a literature survey has been performed using the databases searched up to the year 2012 for the latest information on C. asiatica. This paper aims to cover up in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies reporting the results relevant to neuroprotective effect of this plant.2. Phytochemical Content of C. asiatica C. asiatica has been reported to contain a vast number of compounds belonging to different chemical classes. The major chemical class found in this plant is triterpene saponosides. The major ones are known as asiatic acid, madecassic acid (6-hydroxy-asiatic acid), asiaticoside, madecassoside, and madasiatic acid (Figure 2), betulinic acid, thankunic acid, and isothankunic acid [32, 33]. Moreover, There are some other triterpenes such as brahmic acid, centellin, centellicin, asiaticin, bayogenin, terminolic acid, 3β,6β,23-trihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid, 3β,6β,23-trihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid, 3-O-[α-L-arabinofuranosyl] 2α,3β,6β,23-α tetrahydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid, centellasapogenol A, centellasaponins A-D, ursolic acid, pomolic acid, 3-epimaslinic acid, 23-O-acetylmadecassoside, and 23-O-acetylasiaticoside B [34–41]. Presence of several flavonoid derivatives such as quercetin, kaempferol, patuletin, rutin, apigenin, castilliferol (Figure 3), castillicetin, and myricetin has been reported in C. asiatica [35, 39, 42], while isolation of polysaccharides (e.g., centellose) [43], polyacetylenes (e.g., cadinol, acetoxycentellinol, centellin, centellicin, and asiaticin) [36, 44], sterols (e.g., 11-oxoheneicosanil-cyclohexane, dotriacont-8-en-1-oic acid, sitosterol 3-O-β-glucoside, stigmasterol 3-O-β-glucoside, and castasterone) [41, 45, 46], and phenolic acids (e.g., rosmarinic acid, 3,5-di-O-caffeoil quinic acid, 1,5-di-O-caffeoil quinic acid, 3,4-di-O-caffeoil quinic acid, 4,5-di-O-caffeoil quinic acid, ettacrynic acid, chlorogenic acid, and isochlorogenic acid [Figure 4]) [40, 42, 47] has been also identified in this species. In our quantitative study on C. asiatica of Turkish origin by HPLC, we reported existence of several phenolic acids, for example, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, o-coumaric acid, and trans-cinnamic acid [48]. On the other hand, only a few studies have described the chemical composition of the essential oils obtained from C. asiatica from Japan, South Africa, and Thailand, which mainly consisted of monoterpene and sesquiterpene derivatives [49–51]. In our work, we examined the essential oil composition of C. asiatica cultivated in Turkey by GC-MS for the first time and identified α-copaene as the major component [48].3. Neuroprotective Activity of C. asiatica3.1. In Vitro Studies C. asiatica (gotu kola) is a reputed plant species for its traditional use in ayurvedic and Chinese medicines [52], and its positive effects on brain aging have been generally attributed to its two major triterpene saponosides; asiatic and madecassic acids as well as their heterosides; asiaticoside and madecassoside, respectively. For instance, the hydroalcoholic extract of the plant was tested in vitro against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the key enzyme taking a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). Since deficit in the level of acetylcholine (ACh), which is hydrolyzed by AChE, has been identified in the brains of AD patients, inhibition of AChE as well as its sister enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has become a rational target in drug development against AD [53]. The extract was found to inhibit AChE with 50% of inhibition rate at 150 μg/mL concentration by the spectrophotometric method of Ellman [54]. In our study on the ethanol extracts prepared from the aerial parts of C. asiatica of both Turkish and Indian origins along with the standardized gotu kola extract (containing 10.78% of total asiaticoside and madecassoside) imported from China, we comparatively examined inhibitory potential of these three extracts against AChE, BChE, and tyrosinase (TYRO) at 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL concentrations [48]. As aforementioned that cholinesterases are the important enzymes for AD treatment, TYRO has become an important target for Parkinson's disease (PD) since this enzyme plays a role in neuromelanin formation in the human brain and could be significant in occurrence of dopamine neurotoxicity associated with neurodegeneration linked to PD [55]. According to our results obtained at 200 μg/mL, only the standardized extract was found to inhibit AChE (48.28 ± 1.64%), whereas the ethanol extracts of the plant samples from Turkey and India exerted 46.95 ± 0.94% and 70.30 ± 3.77% against BChE, respectively, and a notable inhibition against TYRO (42.83 ± 4.21% and 56.20 ± 3.17%, resp.). Awad et al. investigated inhibitory property of C. asiatica extract towards glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T), which are the enzymes responsible for GABA metabolism and found out that the extract stimulated the activity of GAD over 40% [56]. On the other hand, the leaf extract of C. asiatica growing in China was shown to display neuroprotection through enhancing phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) in neuroblastoma cells in Aβ(1–42) proteins found within the amyloid plaques occurring in the brains of AD patients [57]. In another study [58], effect of the aqueous leaf extract of the plant on monomers or oligomers that lead to formation of Aβ(1–42) proteins in AD via aggregation was examined using both thioflavin-T test and transmission electron microscope; however, it was observed not to cause any inhibition on aggregation of the monomers and oligomers. Inhibitory activity of the aqueous extract of C. asiatica that contained 84% of asiaticoside was tested by the radioenzymatic assay against phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which play role in neuropsychiatric diseases. The findings pointed out to the fact that the extract could inhibit Ca2+-independent PLA2 and cytosolic PLA2 [59]. The ethanol extract of the plant was observed to cause an increase in neurite development in human SH-SY5Y cell lines at 100 μg/mL concentration, whereas its aqueous extract did not lead any increase in the same cells [60]. Then, the subfractions of the ethanol extract were also tested further in the same assay for neuritic development, and the most effective subfraction was demonstrated to have a nonpolar chemical nature. According to the results of that study, the authors concluded that C. asiatica extract might be beneficial in prevention of neuronal damage. Lee et al. studied neuroprotective potential of thirty six derivatives of asiatic acid prepared by various structural modifications and tested in primary cell culture consisting of rat cortical neurons exposed to glutamate, which is known as a neurotoxin [61]. Three of the compounds displayed higher protective activity than asiatic acid per se and also significantly reduced production of glutamate-induced nitric oxide (NO) as well as levels of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and some other related enzymes.3.2. In Vivo Studies Neuroprotective effect of C. asiatica and its major triterpene saponosides has been extensively studied through different experimental models on animals such as passive avoidance and elevated-plus labyrinth tests for memory enhancing effect [62]. A research was carried out in rats to determine effect of the aqueous extract of C. asiatica on intracerebrovascular streptozocin-induced memory associated with sporadic type of AD by applying the extract at doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg (b.w.) and measuring some oxidative stress parameters such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) [63]. While a clear dose-dependent improvement was observed in memory-related behaviors in the rat group administered the extract at 200 mg/kg (b.w.) dose, a serious decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) and an increase in glutathione and CAT levels were recorded, which led to a final suggestion by the authors that C. asiatica extract has a positive effect on memory that is also related to its remarkable antioxidant effect. The same research group subjected this extract to passive avoidance and spontaneous locomotor activity behavioral tests using pentylenetetrazole-(PTZ-) induced memory loss in rats at 100 and 300 mg/kg (b.w.) doses [64]. Following the behavioral tests, MDA and glutathione levels were determined in the rat brains as oxidative stress markers, which significantly contribute to neurodegeneration. Accordingly, the extracts at the tested doses caused a notable improvement in all test parameters. In another study by Rao et al. [65], enhancing effect of C. asiatica extract on learning and memory was examined during 15 days at 200, 500, 700, and 1000 mg/kg (b.w.) doses by oral administration to mice. Open area, light/dark compartment, and radial-armed labyrinth tests were applied as experimental models, while AChE activity and dendritic arborization development were taken into consideration as biochemical markers. According to the findings, the extract displayed improving effect in radial-armed labyrinth test, whereas it did not cause any change in locomotor activity. On the other hand, extract administration resulted in an increase in AChE activity and dendritic arborization in CA3 neurons located in hippocampus. Thus, the authors concluded that the extracts may positively influence neuronal morphology, especially in young adult mice. In a similar study performed by the same researchers, the fresh leaf extract of C. asiatica was given to adult mice at 2, 4, and 6 mL/kg doses during 2, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively [66]. After these periods, the removed brains of mice were investigated under microscope, which pointed out to the evidence that the extract given at 6 mL/kg dose during 6 weeks caused a significant augment in dendritic arborization in neurons. These authors came to another similar conclusion that the juice obtained by pressing the fresh leaves of C. asiatica tested in the same experimental model in mice also enhanced dendritic arborization [67]. Besides, C. asiatica extract was shown to reduce levels of β-amyloid plaques in hippocampus in mice [68]. Shinomol and Muralidhara investigated effect of C. asiatica extract against oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by 3-nitropropionic acid, a fungal-derived neurotoxin, in the brains of male prepubertal mice, and the extract was found to diminish oxidative stress remarkably through influencing the parameters such as MDA and radical oxygen species [69]. In a related study on rats, C. asiatica extract was reported to have a protective effect against mitochondrial damage occurred in PD by means of improving oxidative stress parameters [70]. Anticonvulsant effect of the crude material and extracts prepared from C. asiatica, also known as “brahmi” in Hindu, was determined in PTZ-induced convulsion model in rats and compared with fenitoin as the reference drug [71]. The data indicated that the crude material of the plant exerted a mild level of anticonvulsant effect at 500 mg/kg dose, while the methanol extract had superior effect to that of the crude material at 3rd and 6th hs. The extract prepared with propylene glycol also produced a dose-dependent anticonvulsant activity at 500 and 1000 mg/kg (b.w.) doses. Similarly, Ganachari et al. demonstrated in vivo anticonvulsant effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of C. asiatica against PTZ- and strychnine-induced opistotonus convulsions at 100 mg/kg (b.w.) [72]. Moreover, the extract was observed to reduce lipid peroxidation and spontaneous locomotor activity, whilst it potentiated pentobarbital-induced sleeping duration and diazepam-induced hyperactivity. In another paper [73], the ethyl acetate fraction of C. asiatica as well as combination of the fraction with some antiepileptic drugs including fenitoin, valproate, and gabapentin individually was administered intraperitoneally to the mice with convulsion induced by PTZ and found that the combinations caused an additive effect producing a higher anticonvulsant activity than each of the drugs. Additionally, neurotoxicity of the fraction and each combination was established by rotarod test, and combination of the extract with gabapentin was less neurotoxic. In the light of this evidence, the authors stated that conjoint use of the ethyl acetate fraction of C. asiatica with epileptic drugs might be beneficial for epileptic patients. In another study [74], De Lucia et al. reported anticonvulsant and sedative activities of the hydroalcoholic extract of C. asiatica in rats using elevated-plus labyrinth and PTZ-induced convulsion models, and the extract was also shown to exert low toxicity by chronic application with the LD50 value of 675 mg/kg (b.w.). Anticonvulsant activity of the hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, water, and n-butanol extracts prepared from C. asiatica was determined using PTZ-induced convulsion model in male Wistar rats, and effect of the extracts was also searched on Na+/K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+-ATPase activity [75]. The results pointed out to an increase in activity of three types of ATPases in the extract-administered groups accompanied by anticonvulsant activity. Anxiolytic activity of the hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of C. asiatica and asiaticoside was tested using elevated-plus labyrinth, open area, social interaction, locomotor activity, and new cage models in rats [76]. The results indicated that only the methanol and ethyl acetate extracts of the plant along with asiaticoside displayed anxiolytic activity in elevated-plus labyrinth test. In another paper [77], sedative effect of C. asiatica was mainly attributed to brahmoside and brahminoside, the triterpene derivatives, whereas anxiolytic activity was suggested to be partly resulted from the interaction with cholecystokinin receptors (CCKB), a group of G protein-coupled receptors which are considered to take a potential place in modulation of anxiety, nociception, and memory. C. asiatica extract was administered orally to old rats during 60 days at 300 mg/kg (b.w.) dose per day, and the cortex, hypothalamus, striatum, cerebellum, and hippocampus regions of the rat brains were investigated in terms of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl (PCO) contents [78]. The researchers made a statement that the extract may be showing a neuroprotective effect in old rats by way of bringing about a significant decrease in PCO contents and lipid peroxidation. Radical scavenging effect of the chloroform-methanol (4 : 1) extract of the plant was examined in monosodium glutamate-treated Sprague-Dawley female rats at 100 and 200 mg/kg doses [79]. Following the extract administration, a significant increase was observed in SOD and CAT levels, whereas glutathione level was not influenced. Flora and Gupta reported that the flavonoid fraction of C. asiatica demonstrated a protecting effect against lead acetate-induced neurotoxicity in mice through antioxidant mechanisms [80]. In another paper, asiatic acid, one of the major triterpene derivatives in C. asiatica, administered orally at 30, 75, and 165 mg/kg (b.w.) doses, was shown to have neuroprotective property in mice with permanent cerebral ischemia by evaluating infarct volume and behavioral changes between 1st and 7th days [81]. In the same study, the compound was additionally investigated in HT-22 cells exposed to oxygen glucose in terms of cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential. Asiatic acid considerably diminished the infarct volume by 60% and 26% at the 1st and 7th days, respectively, which improved neurological status at 24 h after ischemia. The authors concluded that asiatic acid, which might be mediated to some extent by decreasing blood-brain barrier permeability as well as reduction in mitochondrial damage, could be useful for cerebral ischemia treatment. Probable improving effect of C. asiatica extract at 150 and 300 mg/kg (p.o.) doses was assessed against colchicine-induced memory using Morris water maze and plus-maze performance tests in male Wistar rats as well as oxidative damage parameters such as lipid peroxidation, nitrite, reduced glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase, SOD, and as a biochemical parameter, AChE activity [82]. The 25-day chronic administration of the extract caused a significant improvement in memory and oxidative damage parameters along with AChE activity. On the other hand, asiaticoside from C. asiatica exerted a neuroprotective effect against PD by reversing neurotoxicity induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in rats via balancing dopamine and antioxidant mechanism [83]. Antidepressant activity of C. asiatica was evaluated using its triterpene fraction in cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus regions of rat brains by determining the corticosterone levels [84]. The triterpene fraction created a momentous diminution in corticosterone level and a notable increase in amount of monoamine-related neurotransmitters.3.3. Clinical Studies Although many in vivo studies have been carried out on central-nervous-system-(CNS-) related effects of C. asiatica, the literature survey has revealed presence of only a limited number of clinical studies with this species. The results of an early double-blind clinical study on the children with mental deficiency in 1977 showed that a statistically significant improvement was recorded in the children in 3rd and 6th months following administration of C. asiatica [85]. Possible effect of the capsulated aqueous extract of C. asiatica standardized to contain 29.9 mg/g tannic acid, 1.09 mg/g asiaticoside, and 48.89 mg/g asiatic acid was determined in a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical study carried out on 28 healthy and elder volunteers consisting of 4 men and 24 women with the average age of 65.05 ± 3.56 in Thailand [86]. The extract was given to the subjects once a day at 250, 500, and 750 mg doses during 2 months, and their cognitive performance was evaluated by a variety of parameters using computer-assisted techniques. The findings revealed that the highest dose of C. asiatica extract tested in this study possessed a cognitive enhancing effect. In a similar study [87], Dev et al. investigated effect of the capsulated C. asiatica extract on cognitive performance conducted with a total 41 of middle-age healthy subjects consisting of 22 women and 19 men. The extract was given to the subjects in a capsule once a day during 2 months. The cognitive performance was measured using Woodcock-Johnson Cognitive Abilities Test III (WJCAT III), and the extract was found to have a remarkably positive influence on all of the subjects. A recent clinical study consisting of 60 elderly subjects with average age of 65 with mild cognitive deficiency indicated that C. asiatica extract administered at 500 mg dose twice per day during 6 months led to a significant cognitive improvement according to Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scoring [88].4. Precautions Although C. asiatica is one of the top-selling herbal medicines due to its remarkable pharmacological effects, some precautions should be taken for this plant. It has been known to be safe when taken at the recommended doses; however, skin irritation and contact dermatitis have been reported in some cases [89–91]. In a very early paper in 1969 [92], the total saponoside fraction containing brahmic acid and its derivatives of the plant was stated to cause infertility in an experiment conducted on human and rat sperms. In consistency with this paper, Newall et al. also affirmed that infertility was observed in female mice after oral administration of C. asiatica [93]. Another result pointed out to the fact that chronic treatment of C. asiatica might induce a spontaneous abortion in pregnant women [94]. Since the plant may bring about a raise in blood sugar and lipid levels, diabetic and hyperlipidemic patients should consider taking preparations of C. asiatica [93]. Briefly, maximum duration suggested for the use of C. asiatica preparations is 6 weeks, and at least, a 2-week break is needed after every long duration use. Even though no drug interaction has been reported for this plant up to date, pregnant and breast-feeding women are suggested to avoid using this herbal medicine.5. Conclusion C. asiatica, widely known as “gotu kola,” is a reputed medicinal plant for its various pharmacological effects favorable for human health. Besides its potent wound healing property, a number of studies described the noteworthy protective effect of the plant against several diseases of CNS. Biological effects of C. asiatica have been generally attributed to the major triterpene derivatives including asiatic acid, madecassic acid, asiaticoside, madecassoside, and brahmic acid. The neuroprotective effect of the plant has been suggested to result from different mechanisms, most of which have referred to positive influences on oxidative stress parameters.

To examine this effect, we investigated the gene expression of cytokines relevant to osteoblast/osteoclast differentiation, and evaluated histomorphometric findings in mature rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Total RNA was extracted from knee joints with CIA after ETN or placebo administration. Subsequently, realtime-PCR was carried out to quantify the mRNAs encoding Wnt-1, Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegelin (OPG) and TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-alpha. In histomorphometric analysis, the infiltrating pannus volume and pannus surface, and the following items in contact with pannus surface were measured: osteoclast number, osteoid surface, osteoid volume and labeling surface. These were evaluated in the distal femur with CIA with or without ETN administration. TNF-alpha, RANKL and OPG mRNA expressions, linked to osteoclastogenesis, were not significantly different with or without ETN administration. ETN administration significantly increased Wnt-1 mRNA expression, the osteoblast promoter, and decreased DKK-1 mRNA expression, the Wnt signal inhibitor. In histomorphometric analysis, pannus volume, pannus surface and osteoclast number, parameters of bone destruction, were not significantly different among groups. Osteoid volume, osteoid surface and labeling surface, parameters of bone formation, increased significantly with ETN administration. Our results suggest that ETN suppresses DDK-1 expression, and, as a result, Wnt expression is promoted and osteoblastogenesis becomes more active, independent of the regulation of osteoclast activity. Marked bone formation is attributed to the fact that ETN directly promotes osteoblastogenesis, not as a result of suppressing osteoclastogenesis.

Marked bone formation is attributed to the fact that ETN directly promotes osteoblastogenesis, not as a result of suppressing osteoclastogenesis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease, accompanied by synovitis, that causes joint destruction. Various cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, have been implicated as important mediators of inflammation and joint destruction in RA.1, 2, 3 The scientific consensus is that the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegelin (OPG) system is pivotal to the pathogenesis of bone erosions in RA.4 Also, TNF-alpha promotes the expression of RANKL, and that is associated with up-regulation of osteoclast activity. 5 From the point of view of bone metabolism, it has also become clear that TNF-alpha regulates the activity of osteoblasts, which play a role in bone metabolism with osteoclasts.6, 7, 8, Recently, it was reported that Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway, regulated the balance between osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis in an inflammatory joint RA model. TNF-alpha may suppress osteoblast differentiation via promoting the expression of DKK-1, inhibiting Wnt the signaling pathway.9, 10, 11, In recent years, the development of TNF-alpha-targeted biologic agents has provided an excellent curative effect.12, , 13, 14, 15 As previously reported, a number of clinical reports have described radiographic evidence of the repair of erosion in RA.16, 17, 18, 19The administration of etanercept (ETN), an anti TNF-alpha agent, reduced the total Sharp score from the baseline established before the initiation of therapy in a large clinical study. 15 ETN may promote bone formation, as well as inhibiting bone destruction via suppression of TNF-alpha function. Although there are some indications that destructive bone lesions can be repaired in RA joints, the mechanism of this repair remains unknown and histologically unproven. To examine the effects of ETN on bone formation, we i) investigated the gene expression of cytokines relevant to osteoblast differentiation within bone infiltrated by pannus (Experiment A), and ii) performed histological evaluation of bone repair (Experiment B) in mature rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), an animal experimental model of RA.20MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals Seven-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (retired breeding animals, body weight 266–381 g, Shimizu Laboratory Supply, Kyoto, Japan) were used in this experiment. This experiment was carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation of the Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University. During this experiment, animals were freely fed with tap water and food (CE-2; CLEA, Tokyo, Japan; calcium content 1.18 g/100 g, phosphorus content 1.09 g/100 g, vitamin D3 content 250 IU/100 g). The room temperature was set to 24 ˚C, and after about 2 weeks of preliminary breeding, the animals were used for the experiments.Collagen arthritis models According to the method described by Trentham et al., 20　1 mL of emulsion containing 0.5 mg bovine type II collagen (0.3% acetic acid solution; K-41 Cosmo-Bio, Tokyo) and 0.5 mg of incomplete Freund's adjuvant (521-00021; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) were injected intracutaneously at three sites on the back of CIA group rats, and 1 week later, a half dosage of the same emulsions was injected. In the non-immunized group (N group), physiological saline was injected in the same manner. The development of arthritis was judged by the redness and swelling in the ankle by same observer. The onset of arthritis was observed about 2 weeks after immunization, and arthritis became severe until 4 weeks. Administration of biologic agents In the ETN administration group, rats were subcutaneously administered 3 mg/kg ETN 3 times per week (E group). In the placebo-administered group, physiological saline was injected in the same manner (P group).Experiment A: Analysis of mRNA expressionAnimal grouping and ETN administration The animals were divided randomly into 3 groups: E group (n = 21), P group (n = 21) and non-immunized group (N group) (n = 5). Administrations of ETN (E group) and placebo (P group) were started 1 day after immunization, and 7 animals were killed 7, 14 and 21 days after immunization in each group. Tissue collection and RNA isolation After the animals were killed, the bilateral distal femur and proximal tibia (cut off 5 mm from the joint line) were collected and cooled with liquid nitrogen immediately. The bone tissues were collected aseptically and all connective tissue, including the periosteum, was completely removed. Frozen bones were homogenized in appropriate volumes in an Isogen Kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo) using POLYTRON (KINEMATICA AG, Tokyo). Total RNA was extracted from the tissue homogenates according to the manufacturer's instructions. Additionally, we defecated the extracted total RNA using an RNeasy plus mini kit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry.Reverse transcription The total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The conditions were as follows: incubation 60 min at 37 °C, reaction inactivation by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and maintenance at 4 °C.

Rat primers were used to analyze DKK-1, Wnt-1, RANKL, OPG, TNF-alpha and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, housekeeping gene), respectively. Specific primers designed with reference to the Universal ProbeLibrary Assay Design Center and Universal ProbeLibrary Probe (Roche Applied Science, Madison, WI) were used as shown in Table 1. A quantitative real-time PCR was performed to compare expression levels of each mRNA. EXPRESS qPCR Supermix with Premixed ROX (Invitrogen) was used, with an initial denaturation step of 20 s at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 1 s at 95 °C, and 20 s at 60 °C as the annealing temperature. Relative quantification of mRNA expression was calculated by a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System with SDS2.3 software (Applied Biosystems, Carsbad, CA).Experiment B: Histological findingsAnimal grouping and ETN administration Twenty rats were immunized and divided into the E group (n = 10) and P group (n = 10), and killed 8 weeks after CIA immunization. ETN administration was started 3 weeks after immunization because bone destruction was observed histologically 3 weeks after immunization. 21Preparation of hard tissue specimens Histological findings in hard tissue specimens were taken from the medial condyle of the femur in the mid-sagittal plane then compared between the groups. Bone labeling by subctaneous injection of calcein at 10 mg/kg was performed twice at 17 days and 1 day before the animals were killed, and tetracycline at 20 mg/kg was given once at 9 days before the animals were killed [schedule 1/7/1/7/1 (number of days of the 1st labeling/number of days between 1st and 2nd labeling/number of days of the 2nd labeling/number of days between 2nd labeling and 3rd labeling/number of days between 3rd labeling and killing)]. The labeling schedule was decided as the result of trial and error of preliminary experiment. The knee joint with larger swelling in each rat was collected with the joint capsule and synovial membranes preserved, and fixed in 70% alcohol. The remaining whole knee joint was stained with Villaneuva bone stain for 7 days, dehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol, and embedded in methyl-methacrylate without decalcification. The resulting blocks of knee joint specimens were sectioned in the sagittal plane at a thickness of 5 µm with a microtome (Leica Biosystems, Solms, Germany). Bone histomorphometryFig. 1. Schematic presentations of unit area (a) and infiltrating pannus (b). a: Epiphyseal bone marrow is divided into 3 regions (A1-A3) by 2 lines connecting 2 points, each equally dividing lines E1-E2 and C1-C2 into 3 portions. b: We defined the shaded area as the pannus infiltrating the epiphyseal medulla of the posteromedial femoral condyle. C, cartilage; C-CL, the line connecting the remaining edge of the posterior cortex to the posterior cartilage; EL, epiphyseal line; FC, femoral condyle; PC, posterior cortex. Bone histomorphometric measurements of the femur were made using a semiautomatic image analyzing system (System Supply, Nagano, Japan) and a fluorescent microscope (eclipse 80i; Nikon, Tokyo) set at a magnification power of 400. Because it was difficult to quantify bone formation after definite destructive action, we regarded osteoid production and bone calcification seen on the surface of the pannus as evidence of the repair of erosion. Twenty sections closest to the mid-sagittal plane of the medial femoral condyle were sampled for each group, 2 sections per rat, each parameter was measured and the average was compared among the different groups. A line connecting the intersection of the epiphyseal line and the anterior cortex (E1) to the intersection of the epiphyseal line and the posterior cortex (E2) was equally divided into 3 portions, and the 2 division points were connected to 2 points equally dividing into 3 the line connecting the anterior end (C1) with the posterior end (C2) of the articular cartilage; the bone marrow was thus divided into 3 regions: A1 to A3. We defined the A3 region as a unit area (tissue volume) (Fig. 1A).21 To measure the pannus volume and pannus surface infiltrating the epiphyseal medulla of the posteromedial femoral condyle, we chose the line connecting the remaining edge of the posterior cortex to the posterior cartilage (C-CL) (Fig. 1B). We defined the shaded area as the infiltrating pannus. The pannus surface was measured in this area exclusive of the surface on the C-CL. Then, the following items in contact with the pannus surface were measured: osteoclast number, osteoid surface, osteoid volume and labeling surface. We also counted the number of plasma cells, macrophages, and synovial blood vessels per high power field (HPF) in the same area to assess the activity of the infiltrating pannus. The field was inclusive of the pannus close to the bone surface, but exclusive of bone tissue.Statistical analysis Statistical significance was analysed using the software package Dr. SPSS 2 for Windows 11.0.1J (SPSS, Tokyo). In experiment A, Fisher’s protected least significant difference procedure was performed after repeated-measures analysis of variance. In experiment B, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare median values. P < 0.05 was considered significant in both experiments.RESULTSExperiment A: Analysis of mRNA expressionFig. 2. Relative quantification of mRNA expression in bone. mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegelin (OPG) do not change with etanercept (ETN) administration. Treatment with ETN tends to reduce the RANKL/OPG ratio. DKK-1 mRNA expression in the E group is lower than the P group. Wnt-1 mRNA expression is increased with ETN administration. N, non -immunized group; d, days after immunization. Values are the mean ± SD (n = 7). * P < 0.05 versus the N group. †P < 0.05 versus the P group. Expression of TNF-alpha increased significantly with time in the E group (P = 0.005), and tended to increase over the course of time in the P group (P = 0.065) ( Fig. 2). Compared with the N group, significant differences were shown on day 21 in both the E and P groups (P = 0.033, 0.035, respectively). Expression of RANKL in the P group tended to increase over time, whereas in the E group it showed no marked change. In all groups and at all times, there were no significant differences compared to the N group. OPG mRNA expression on day 7 tended to be higher in the E group than in the P group (P = 0.053), and significantly decreased in all groups and at all times compared with the N group, independent of ETN administration. TNF-alpha, RANKL and OPG mRNA expressions were not significantly different between E and P groups at all times. Treatment with ETN tended to reduce the RANKL/OPG ratio on day 14 (P = 0.072), but the difference did not reach statistical significance at any time. DKK-1 mRNA expression in the E group decreased significantly on days 7 and 14 (P = 0.009, 0.033, respectively) compared to the P group, and tended to be lower than the P group on day 21 (P = 0.085). With the exception of day 7 in the E group, expression of Wnt-1 mRNA significantly decreased in all groups and at all times compared with the N group, independent of ETN administration. However, ETN administration significantly increased Wnt-1 mRNA expression on days 7 and 21 (P = 0.014, 0.047, respectively) compared with the placebo administration.Experiment B: Histological findingsTable 2.Bone histomorphometry of the posteromedial femoral condyle in the mid-sagittal planeGroupPV/TV (%)PS/TV (µm/µm2)Oc.N/PS (/mm)OV/PV (%)OS/PS (%)LS/PS (%)E34.3 ± 10.90.0014 ± 0.00053.13 ± 8.091.88 ± 1.48*27.6 ± 12.9*41.6 ± 14.1*P30.8 ± 12.80.0015 ± 0.00063.31 ± 6.770.21 ± 0.198.3 ± 5.711.7 ± 6.9 Values are the mean ± SD (n = 10).

C, cartilage; EL, epiphyseal line; FC, femoral condyle; PC, posterior cortex. Bone histomorphometric analysis of the posteromedial condyle of the femur in the mid-sagittal plane was performed. The pannus volume and pannus surface were not significantly different between the groups (P = 0.478, 0.718, respectively) (Table 2). The average number of osteoclasts on the pannus surface did not change with ETN administration (P = 0.398). Osteoid volume, osteoid surface and labeling surface on the surface of the pannus increased significantly with ETN administration (P < 0.001). The number of HPF, which met the above conditions, varied across sections (2–5 fields per section). Totals of 55 and 53 HPF were examined in the P group and E group, respectively. The number of plasma cells, macrophages and blood vessels per HPF were not significantly different between the groups (P = 0.355, 0.355, 0.063, respectively) (Table 3). Histologic sections of the knee joint stained with Villanueva bone stain are shown in Fig. 3. The pannus infiltrated the posteromedial femoral condyle (Fig. 3a). Although pannus formation and bone destruction were not different between the E group (Fig. 3b) and P group (Fig. 3d), more osteoid production (Figs. 3b and d: black arrowheads) and bone calcification (Figs. 3c and e: white arrowheads) were seen on the pannus-contacting bone surface in the E group than in the P group.DISCUSSION Genovese et al. reported that 10% (20 of 201) patients treated with ETN had negative change in the total Sharp score from the baseline on 5-year radiographs.22 Klareskog el al. also reported similar results of radiographic changes in RA patients treated with ENT and methotrexate combination therapy.15 It is clear that development of several effective treatment options such as ETN has induced repair of bone erosions in RA, but the mechanism of "bone repair" is still unknown. To clarify this uncertain mechanism, we attempted to investigate "bone repair" using molecular biological and histological methods with CIA. Trentham et al. reported that sensitization to type II collagen caused arthritis similar to RA.20 CIA has been used as an RA model for studies on the pathology and treatment of RA. In the present study, we chose knee joints because i) the incidence of knee arthritis was high; ii) arthritis of the knee tended to be severe and iii) our previous study investigated knee joints of CIA histologically and with molecular biology.21, 23 ETN is a protein that intercepts or inhibits the work of TNF-alpha, but does not inhibit production.3 Therefore, it is acceptable that expression of TNF-alpha mRNA was not inhibited by ETN administration. Expression of RANKL and OPG were not different with or without ETN administration. However, treatment with ETN showed a tendency to reduce the RANKL/OPG ratio. Catrina et al. reported that anti-TNF therapy did not suppress synovial RANKL expression, but promoted OPG expression in RA patients. It was concluded that therapy with TNF antagonists in RA modulates the OPG/RANKL system, a potential mechanism that could explain the retardation of radiographic damage observed following anti-TNF therapy.24 We think our findings from an animal model in which anti-TNF therapy reduced the RANKL/OPG ratio in synovial tissue support their conclusion. Furthermore, in our histological study, the pannus volume, pannus surface and average number of osteoclasts on the pannus surface did not change with ETN administration. By the same token, the number of plasma cells, macrophages and synovial blood vessels were not significantly different among groups. This result is reasonable in the light of our analysis of mRNA expression that indicated ETN did not suppress RANKL expression. This implies ETN has limited influence on osteoclastogenesis. In the meanwhile, from the standpoint of bone formation, more osteoid and bone calcification were seen on the pannus-contacting bone surface in the E group than in the P group. Recently, it was clarified that the Wnt family stimulated osteoblast formation via co-receptor LRP5/6, and DKK, an antagonist of LRP5/6, suppressed osteoblast formation by blocking the Wnt signaling pathway.10, 25 Interestingly, Diarra et al. reported bone formation in RA was hampered by TNF-mediated expression of DKK-1.9 These facts and our results suggest that ETN suppresses DDK-1 expression via the blocking effect of TNF-alpha and, as a result, Wnt expression is promoted and osteoblastogenesis becomes more active independent of regulation of osteoclast activity. Therefore, increase of bone formation is attributed to the fact that ETN directly promotes osteoblastogenesis and not as a result of suppressing osteoclastogenesis. Our study has a few limitations. In experiment A, ETN administration was started 1 day after immunization because TNF-alpha expression began to decrease after peaking 7 days after immunization. 23 A previous study reported that ETN reduced the incidence of arthritis, 26 so one limitation is that ETN administration was started before the onset of arthritis. However, in our preliminary experiment, the incidence of arthritis in CIA rats was not significantly different between the E group and P group (85.7%, 89.9% respectively). In experiment B, ETN administration was started 3 weeks after immunization because bone destruction was observed histologically 3 weeks after immunization. 21 As described above, if we assume that expression of TNF-alpha may deteriorate soon after 3 weeks’ post-initial immunization, ETN may be no longer involved in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis from that point onwards. As a result, bone resorption during histomorfometry was not downregulated. ETN administration was started less than 3 weeks after immunization, which may cause inhibition of pannus formation itself. This is the second limitation of this study.
